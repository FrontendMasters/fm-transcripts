1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.817
Now, once you've decided that
a system is what you need,

2
00:00:02.817 --> 00:00:05.993
it's really helpful to understand
what the heck you're in for.

3
00:00:05.993 --> 00:00:06.499
[LAUGH] So

4
00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:11.281
what I'm gonna cover is a fairly
comprehensive breakdown of design systems.

5
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:14.312
I think as an industry, we've been
doing this stuff for a while now.

6
00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:15.227
It's been seven,

7
00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:19.129
eight years since the words, design system
have really kinda come on the scene.

8
00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:24.411
And before that, five or six years, folks
were working very systematically, right?

9
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:29.341
So this, as I said earlier, is an attempt
for me to kinda put a stake in

10
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:34.366
the ground and define what I mean when
I use all of these kinds of words.

11
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:38.024
We're gonna start with the layers that
are labeled along the bottom here,

12
00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:40.881
foundations, tokens,
core systems, and components.

13
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:45.485
And then we will talk about how each of
those layers is broken down into three

14
00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:46.005
parts.

15
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.779
So that's assets, processes,
and documentation.

16
00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:52.135
The layers are very conceptual, and

17
00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:55.254
the parts make those layers
a lot more tangible.

18
00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:58.557
So let's dive in, and
we'll start with foundations.

19
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.597
So the foundation's layer of
a design system is the subset of

20
00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:08.187
the organization's brand
that's intended to be used for

21
00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:11.422
the design and
development of digital interfaces.

22
00:01:11.422 --> 00:01:13.299
So we can think about
something like color.

23
00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.484
I heard somebody online was saying
color is a struggle for them.

24
00:01:17.484 --> 00:01:21.792
So in the context of a brand,
there's all kinds of color you can use.

25
00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:24.888
Many times,
if you look at your brand guidelines,

26
00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:29.576
there's gonna be a whole palette of
colors for use in expressing that brand.

27
00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:34.780
But in digital interface work, oftentimes
we don't wanna use tons and tons of color.

28
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.842
It's mostly a gray scale, right,

29
00:01:36.842 --> 00:01:39.946
to sort of build an interface
that kinda disappears.

30
00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:44.095
And then we use one or two primary
brand colors to kinda highlight or

31
00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:45.140
accent things.

32
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.189
And then we may have a small subset of
colors to use for more specific meanings,

33
00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.492
like a cautionary color or
a successful color, things like this.

34
00:01:54.492 --> 00:01:58.939
So that is definitely a subset of the
types of colors that might be needed in

35
00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.383
the brand expression.

36
00:02:00.383 --> 00:02:04.477
So what we're doing here is we're looking
at everything that's available in that

37
00:02:04.477 --> 00:02:08.569
brand layer, and we're scaling it down to
just the things that are needed to create

38
00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.695
a digital interface.

39
00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:13.538
So other than color, what else can
live at the foundational layer?

40
00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:17.314
Well, there's lots and
lots of stuff that can live here, okay?

41
00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:21.048
The lists that I'll share with you here
are definitely not exhaustive, but

42
00:02:21.048 --> 00:02:24.896
these are just the kinds of things that
are representative of what most systems

43
00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:25.668
are offering.

44
00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:30.001
So things like design principles,
how do we make decisions around design?

45
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.070
Things like logos and typefaces,
how do we use those, and

46
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.026
what's the appropriate way to do so
in a digital world?

47
00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:38.151
What about how we use audio or sound?

48
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:40.434
How about voice and tone for our content?

49
00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:43.363
Layout guidelines,
motion guidelines, elevation,

50
00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:46.488
all of that stuff can be included
at the foundations layer.

51
00:02:46.488 --> 00:02:51.572
The best design systems are able to
clarify and focus those brand guidelines

52
00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:56.029
in ways that are very specific to
the digital work we've got to do.

53
00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.239
So that's kinda the foundation's layer.

54
00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.500
The next layer,
we just call the tokens layer.

55
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.838
And this is a set of codified design
decisions that are based on the stuff

56
00:03:06.838 --> 00:03:09.815
we've identified in
the foundation's layer.

57
00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:14.178
So the goal of the tokens layer is to
take those design concepts that we

58
00:03:14.178 --> 00:03:17.653
just covered in foundations and
express them in a way.

59
00:03:17.653 --> 00:03:19.284
We say that we use the word codify.

60
00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:21.124
But really, if you're a developer,

61
00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:23.775
you can think about this as
very similar to a variable.

62
00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:27.253
All I really mean is that
we give them a name and

63
00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:31.477
we give them a value, so
a token name and a token value.

64
00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:35.907
And if we use color as an example,
you might define a color,

65
00:03:35.907 --> 00:03:40.605
token with a name of color primary
brand and assign that token,

66
00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:44.169
the value of your brand's
primary blue color.

67
00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.867
It's not just colors, of course, this
applies to, and it's much more complex

68
00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:53.289
than this because there are layers of
tokens that you can define if needed But

69
00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.382
I want to give you the concept here.

70
00:03:55.382 --> 00:03:58.646
And you could codify lots of
different things beyond color.

71
00:03:58.646 --> 00:04:04.037
You can do type stacks, you can do radius
for your buttons, all that kinda stuff.

72
00:04:04.037 --> 00:04:07.907
And we do this for many reasons.

73
00:04:07.907 --> 00:04:12.905
But there are kind of three primary
reasons that we've kind of moved in

74
00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:14.778
the direction of tokens.

75
00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:18.588
The first is consistent design or
cohesive experiences.

76
00:04:18.588 --> 00:04:22.952
That's because if you've got that single
source of truth for, in this example,

77
00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:25.038
the hex value of a primary brand color,

78
00:04:25.038 --> 00:04:28.921
then you can trust that it's gonna
be used the same everywhere, right?

79
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:32.062
You were mentioning earlier, you did some
research and you found there's lots of

80
00:04:32.062 --> 00:04:34.718
different buttons, or lots of
different colors and all this stuff.

81
00:04:34.718 --> 00:04:38.200
And there's arguments about
whether that's a concern or not.

82
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.018
But this is a way to kind of say,
let's bring that all under control.

83
00:04:43.018 --> 00:04:46.583
The second reason that we might
think about this kind of approach is

84
00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:47.483
ease of change.

85
00:04:47.483 --> 00:04:52.398
So when you do decide to rebrand, I think
you mentioned, Kayla, you guys were about

86
00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:56.570
to rebrand, [LAUGH] and you wanna
change that primary color in some way.

87
00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.257
Well, this gives you a single
place to make that change and

88
00:05:00.257 --> 00:05:03.577
kind of see that ripple
through all the interfaces.

89
00:05:03.577 --> 00:05:06.082
So it's really powerful, right?

90
00:05:06.082 --> 00:05:07.805
Now, with that power, comes risk.

91
00:05:07.805 --> 00:05:11.865
And we'll talk a little bit more about
what that looks like when we get to

92
00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:14.311
the processes or process section of this.

93
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:19.048
So ease of change is another opportunity
that we get when we think about things at

94
00:05:19.048 --> 00:05:20.119
the token layer.

95
00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.469
And the third is multi-platform support.

96
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.727
So once you've defined the tokens for
your system, you do that in a place that's

97
00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:29.670
separate from all the tooling
that your designers use,

98
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.439
that all of your developers use.

99
00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.639
It sort of lives in its own place,
and you get the opportunity then to

100
00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.357
kinda transform or translate those
values out to different tech stacks, or

101
00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:43.986
designed tooling, or
whatever it is that you need to use.

102
00:05:43.986 --> 00:05:48.408
So in this way, you can support your web
interfaces, maybe built with Sass or

103
00:05:48.408 --> 00:05:50.123
native applications in iOS.

104
00:05:50.123 --> 00:05:52.488
The same tokens can be translated for

105
00:05:52.488 --> 00:05:55.543
use across any of the tools
that you might need.

106
00:05:55.543 --> 00:05:57.746
I'll share in the resources section,
at the end,

107
00:05:57.746 --> 00:06:00.990
there's some really cool work being
done on token specification as well.

108
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.321
So if you're not falling along with some
of the stuff that's happening there.

109
00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:07.978
This stuff is real, it's happening,
it's been supported,

110
00:06:07.978 --> 00:06:09.843
there's really smart folks working on it.

111
00:06:09.843 --> 00:06:12.314
So really cool to see this coming to life.

112
00:06:12.314 --> 00:06:16.842
So I mentioned color, I think I even
mentioned border radius, there's lots and

113
00:06:16.842 --> 00:06:18.785
lots of stuff that you can codify.

114
00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:21.893
So again,
not an exhaust of lists here, but

115
00:06:21.893 --> 00:06:25.422
just a handful of things
you could also consider.

116
00:06:25.422 --> 00:06:30.026
Things like spacing, right, how much space
do we need in and around the objects?

117
00:06:30.026 --> 00:06:30.926
What about elevation?

118
00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:33.972
How much depth do we want
our interface to convey?

119
00:06:33.972 --> 00:06:38.146
Opacity, volume, borders, timing,
all of these kinds of things,

120
00:06:38.146 --> 00:06:41.843
any single design decision you
can kinda codify with a token.

121
00:06:41.843 --> 00:06:46.107
It's a pretty long list, and the ones
that you choose to implement are really

122
00:06:46.107 --> 00:06:49.921
gonna be determined by what's
important to you and your interface.

123
00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:52.774
So I won't tell you here's
the ones you should definitely do.

124
00:06:52.774 --> 00:06:54.103
Color tends to be an easy one,

125
00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:56.455
because every interface has
some kinda color in it.

126
00:06:56.455 --> 00:06:59.799
[LAUGH] So
that's tokens at a conceptual level.

127
00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:05.919
Let's kinda move on to our next layer,
which is what I just call core systems.

128
00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.907
I think of the core systems layer as
a set of building blocks systems,

129
00:07:10.907 --> 00:07:15.127
and these are used to solve
common interface challenges.

130
00:07:15.127 --> 00:07:17.460
So one way to think of this is that,

131
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.053
if you codify a single design decision,
you're gonna get a token.

132
00:07:22.053 --> 00:07:25.827
But if you codify how those
design decisions work together,

133
00:07:25.827 --> 00:07:27.754
you come up with a core system.

134
00:07:27.754 --> 00:07:32.160
So you could codify a single decision
like spacing in a token, and

135
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.166
then using that spacing token
you could more broadly codify

136
00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:39.547
how you handle layout and
use that token in a grid.

137
00:07:39.547 --> 00:07:42.748
So there's a lot of common interface
challenges you can come up with,

138
00:07:42.748 --> 00:07:45.307
create solutions for,
things like your iconography.

139
00:07:45.307 --> 00:07:48.455
I mentioned grids, but
also just layout in general.

140
00:07:48.455 --> 00:07:51.416
Theming, color systems,
type scale systems,

141
00:07:51.416 --> 00:07:55.838
all of these core systems that enable
you to build interfaces with ease.

142
00:07:58.534 --> 00:08:03.039
Most of the time, these core systems are
built with the tokens that we defined at

143
00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:06.671
the previous layer and
that enables that sort of ease of change,

144
00:08:06.671 --> 00:08:09.988
which we talked about earlier
as a benefit for token work.

145
00:08:09.988 --> 00:08:13.305
So these three innermost layers I
just call the fundamental layers,

146
00:08:13.305 --> 00:08:15.718
these are what everything
else is kinda based on.

147
00:08:15.718 --> 00:08:20.357
And if you're someone who's building or
maintaining a design system, then creating

148
00:08:20.357 --> 00:08:23.802
stability in these fundamental
layers is a big part of your job.

149
00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:25.386
The fourth layer, though,

150
00:08:25.386 --> 00:08:29.226
is kinda where your subscribers
will probably wanna focus, right?

151
00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:31.335
This is what we call the components layer,
and

152
00:08:31.335 --> 00:08:34.539
this really just contains the reusable
parts of a digital interface.

153
00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:39.031
This is what most people think of
when they talk about design systems.

154
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:43.771
This is your buttons, and your alerts,
and all this stuff, right,

155
00:08:43.771 --> 00:08:46.153
form inputs, labels, all of it.

156
00:08:46.153 --> 00:08:49.681
Now, components can be really simple,
like a button or a text input.

157
00:08:49.681 --> 00:08:53.271
But they can also be complex,
like a header or a navigation.

158
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:57.738
So you can nest simple components
to create more complex ones.

159
00:08:57.738 --> 00:09:02.417
And when they're built properly,
they are constructed from the foundations,

160
00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.496
the tokens, and the core systems.

161
00:09:04.496 --> 00:09:09.198
And while your subscribers will likely
focus mostly on this components layer,

162
00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:11.794
having those fundamental layers beneath is

163
00:09:11.794 --> 00:09:14.601
what gives them the greater
depth reasoning and

164
00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:19.182
flexibility that you kinda need to evolve
as things around you are changing.

165
00:09:19.182 --> 00:09:20.315
I mentioned a few, but

166
00:09:20.315 --> 00:09:23.194
the list of possible components
is obviously very long.

167
00:09:23.194 --> 00:09:26.602
[LAUGH] If you go to any design
system documentation site,

168
00:09:26.602 --> 00:09:31.288
there's usually a link somewhere that
gets you to the list of components, and

169
00:09:31.288 --> 00:09:36.341
these can range anywhere from just
a few to, 20, 40, 60, 80 components.

170
00:09:36.341 --> 00:09:39.731
So there's lots of these, but
common ones are things like buttons and

171
00:09:39.731 --> 00:09:42.835
search bars, text inputs,
tabs, tooltips, radio buttons,

172
00:09:42.835 --> 00:09:45.196
all the stuff that makes
up digital interfaces.

173
00:09:45.196 --> 00:09:46.955
Of course,
it's impossible to list them all here.

174
00:09:46.955 --> 00:09:50.087
But hopefully, you can kinda
see how this building approach,

175
00:09:50.087 --> 00:09:53.990
starting with the brand and adding layers
until we reach these components will

176
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.730
give you a really solid and
extendable design system.

177
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.367
Now, in order to really kinda cover this
topic, we have to break these layers down

178
00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:03.212
just a little bit to kinda make
them a little bit more practical,

179
00:10:03.212 --> 00:10:04.495
a little bit more tangible.

180
00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:06.036
So let's do that real quick.
