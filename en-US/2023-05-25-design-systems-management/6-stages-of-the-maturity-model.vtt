1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.941
So let's dive into an overview of
the design system maturity model.

2
00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:07.420
So there's kind of four
big components here,

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.780
I've broken this up in an interesting way.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.422
We'll kinda start just by covering the
four main stages that most design systems

5
00:00:14.422 --> 00:00:16.206
go through in their maturity.

6
00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:21.118
So the first one stage 1, I just call
very simply building version one.

7
00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:24.592
[LAUGH] This is literally
everything that you do,

8
00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:29.760
leading up to that very first release
of something that's available for

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.094
subscribers or
consumers inside your organization to use.

10
00:00:34.094 --> 00:00:36.184
Of course, the decisions that you make,

11
00:00:36.184 --> 00:00:39.184
you're gonna have a big impact
on how things move forward.

12
00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:43.352
I'll say that stage 1 can look wildly
different based on a lot of different

13
00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:43.957
factors.

14
00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:47.554
So we're gonna talk about sort
of the generalized ideal, and

15
00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:52.400
then I'll share with you another concept
called origin stories that helps clarify

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.769
why this stage 1 can look so different.

17
00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.226
Really hear you are digging into
the foundations of your brand and

18
00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:04.007
you are doing what I just called
discovering the right first version,

19
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.374
that's kinda of your main focus.

20
00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.091
So the transition from stage 1 to stage 2,

21
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:14.106
is actually the only one
that's really obvious.

22
00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:18.546
And that's because it's connected with
the release of that first version.

23
00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:21.807
So whenever you get through your beta,
your pilots or

24
00:01:21.807 --> 00:01:26.525
whatever it is you do to kind of early
test the system early on and get it ready.

25
00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:29.837
As soon as that first version is live,
you're in stage 2 period, and

26
00:01:29.837 --> 00:01:32.490
you'll never go back to stage
1 unless you start over.

27
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.197
[LAUGH] So that's the nice
thing about stages 1 and 2.

28
00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:42.031
Yeah, so then you're in stage 2 and
stage 2 we just call growing adoption.

29
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:42.722
And again,

30
00:01:42.722 --> 00:01:46.946
this begins as soon as that first
official version of the system is live.

31
00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:51.207
And really, this is because as soon as you
spent all this time and effort and money

32
00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:55.799
building this thing, of course, you wanna
know, is anybody else gonna wanna use it?

33
00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.520
[LAUGH] Now hopefully, you've worked with
a few potential subscribers during that

34
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.385
first version, that during stage 1, so
you've got a couple subscribers, right?

35
00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:10.076
There's a few folks who maybe were on
board early on who got it, but really,

36
00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:15.064
stage 2 is interesting because the thing
you've built is almost never the thing

37
00:02:15.064 --> 00:02:17.577
that everybody wants to adopt, right?

38
00:02:17.577 --> 00:02:20.059
It's an early version,
it's an early iteration.

39
00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:25.316
And so stage 2 oftentimes looks like you
iterating on the system to make it really

40
00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:30.442
obvious, that it's a thing people want
to adopt, something they wanna use.

41
00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:34.160
And also, to make it really easy for
them to adopt it, and

42
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.508
we're gonna talk a lot more about
that in the stage 2, deep dive.

43
00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:42.321
This is also where you'll realize, wait,
we actually have to support people.

44
00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:45.583
[LAUGH] We have a product they're using,
and so now,

45
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:50.330
beyond just focusing on building a thing,
we have users, we have people who

46
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.947
have a set of expectations about what
it means for them to use this system.

47
00:02:54.947 --> 00:02:59.233
And so there's a whole another aspect to
the work that kinda comes into play here.

48
00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:04.630
Now, the transition from stage 2
to stage 3 is a mindset shift,

49
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.943
that's why it's a little bit harder for
you to figure this out.

50
00:03:09.943 --> 00:03:15.650
It's really the mindset of the design
system leads or the design system team.

51
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.499
It's when your focus shifts to
challenges that are beyond adoption.

52
00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:24.546
So adoption is the first thing you're
gonna worry about because you can't really

53
00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:27.259
measure anything else until
you have people using it.

54
00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:32.087
And if nobody's using the system,
you can't have any impact.

55
00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:36.758
And so really it's about you sort of
understanding adoption enough, and

56
00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:40.220
not having so
much work to do every time one new person,

57
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.072
one new subscriber wants to use
the system, so you've made it really easy.

58
00:03:45.072 --> 00:03:47.916
Then, all of a sudden,
you find yourself in stage 3.

59
00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:53.724
Stage 3, I call surviving the teenage
years because I have two teenagers

60
00:03:53.724 --> 00:03:58.983
at home, [LAUGH] And so I am in
the throes of this in my personal life.

61
00:03:58.983 --> 00:04:03.595
But this comes with a whole
new set of challenges.

62
00:04:03.595 --> 00:04:08.265
You've got lots of subscribers probably
at this point with more subscribers or

63
00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:10.711
consumers comes a lot more bugs, right?

64
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:15.223
A lot more feature requests, a lot more of
people trying to do stuff with your system

65
00:04:15.223 --> 00:04:17.684
that you never imagined
they would try to do.

66
00:04:17.684 --> 00:04:20.361
So this is where things
get really interesting.

67
00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:24.936
You've got to hear,
prove that your system is making

68
00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:30.132
the impact you promised,
it was gonna make back in stage 1.

69
00:04:30.132 --> 00:04:34.368
So this is where you made a promise
in stage 1, you got some buy-in,

70
00:04:34.368 --> 00:04:35.693
you built the thing.

71
00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:39.351
Now you've got people using it,
now leadership is gonna say,

72
00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:40.670
what are the results?

73
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.104
Show it to me, prove it.

74
00:04:42.104 --> 00:04:45.391
So you're keeping your
promises in stage 3.

75
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:49.946
And it's really about building that
sort of iterative product team,

76
00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:51.886
product mindset in stage 3.

77
00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:54.721
I'll also say I start
to see organizations,

78
00:04:54.721 --> 00:04:57.926
some start with this in mind,
but most of the time,

79
00:04:57.926 --> 00:05:02.724
I see more complex processes,
things like contribution and deprecation.

80
00:05:02.724 --> 00:05:07.925
Those are the things that start to kind
of evolve out into stage 3 systems.

81
00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:14.469
So the transition from stage 3 to
stage 4 is also harder to recognize.

82
00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.446
And it is also a mindset shift, but

83
00:05:17.446 --> 00:05:23.417
it's a change in the perception
the organization has of the system.

84
00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:28.247
So whereas moving from stage 2 to stage 3
was about the change in the perception of

85
00:05:28.247 --> 00:05:32.245
the design system team,
we've stopped worrying about adoption.

86
00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:33.926
We feel like we have that under control.

87
00:05:33.926 --> 00:05:35.725
Now we can move on to other challenges.

88
00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:40.363
Stage 3 to stage 4 is a mindset shift for
the organization.

89
00:05:40.363 --> 00:05:45.039
So the perception is that the system and
the system team are really

90
00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.241
influential leaders, and
that means you've kind of reached stage 4.

91
00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:55.105
Stage 4, I call evolving a healthy
program, and that's when your system has

92
00:05:55.105 --> 00:06:00.135
moved beyond being just a product to
an entire program inside the organization.

93
00:06:00.135 --> 00:06:04.924
The focus here, you're maintaining
a lot of what you've already done, but

94
00:06:04.924 --> 00:06:09.576
you're also adding in these ideals of
sort of sustainability and growth.

95
00:06:09.576 --> 00:06:14.995
There's really typically very highly
evolved engagement with subscribers here.

96
00:06:14.995 --> 00:06:19.150
You're learning how to stabilize the
system in the midst of a lot of change.

97
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.427
You've probably seen a leader or
two come and go by this point, right?

98
00:06:22.427 --> 00:06:24.984
And you've had to survive
that change in leadership.

99
00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:30.302
And in fact, a lot of times these systems,
the teams of a stage

100
00:06:30.302 --> 00:06:37.170
four system are seen as people who have
a voice in the direction of product even.

101
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.779
And so they're brought to
the table in much deeper,

102
00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:45.463
bigger conversations.

103
00:06:45.463 --> 00:06:52.863
Your focus here is to kind of mature into
that sort of stable leadership position.
