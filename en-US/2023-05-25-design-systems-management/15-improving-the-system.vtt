00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:03.785
So, the transition from stage two
to stage three is tricky, right?

2
00:00:03.785 --> 00:00:08.238
We just talked about that teeter totter
possibility, that's very normal.

3
00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:12.919
But I wanna remind you that this
transition is really about a mindset

4
00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.310
shift for the design system team.

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.914
This is when you feel comfortable
enough with adoption,

6
00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:23.960
with your grasp on adoption, that you're
ready to focus on other challenges.

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.759
Now, one way that I think about
the overarching focus of stage three is

8
00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.165
that they're really about finding
a way to keep your promises.

9
00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:37.851
And this is because back in stage one or
stage two, we made a bunch of promises to

10
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:43.189
our leaders, to our potential subscribers,
and we said, this thing is gonna help you.

11
00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:47.209
And it's gonna make you faster,
it's gonna spread accessibility around

12
00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:51.102
the organization, it's going to
create more consistent interfaces,

13
00:00:51.102 --> 00:00:55.598
it's gonna do whatever it was that you
needed to say, whatever promises you made.

14
00:00:55.598 --> 00:01:00.191
Well now stage three,
you kinda gotta live up to that [LAUGH].

15
00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:03.232
So the top challenge here
is really proving that

16
00:01:03.232 --> 00:01:05.900
the system does what you said it would do.

17
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.587
The interesting thing here is,

18
00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:11.842
you're given a little bit of grace in
stage two because people get this, right?

19
00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:16.207
You built the thing, but you have to
spend some time bringing people on board.

20
00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:18.904
So until there is good adoption,
there's no way for

21
00:01:18.904 --> 00:01:21.245
you to make any correlation
to any benefits.

22
00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:23.739
There's no way for you to make an impact.

23
00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:26.306
So now it's time to
keep those promises and

24
00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:30.382
this is where we wanna see the actual
data and it takes time, right?

25
00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:35.434
Even in stage three, we probably still
need more time of capturing that data.

26
00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:38.768
And really, it's not so much,
I mentioned this earlier,

27
00:01:38.768 --> 00:01:42.917
it's not your job to track the efficiency
of your product teams, right?

28
00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:45.241
Of your subscriber groups,
they should be doing that.

29
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:47.828
What you need to do is the correlation.

30
00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:51.442
And so when I say that,
here's what I mean,

31
00:01:51.442 --> 00:01:56.745
as something changes,
we see something else improve, right?

32
00:01:56.745 --> 00:01:59.246
So this is now for
all of the data nerds out there,

33
00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:03.279
I don't think there is a design system
that exists that has enough subscribers

34
00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:07.087
that we're gonna get statistically
relevant correlation here, okay?

35
00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:10.224
So that's not the point, but there's so

36
00:02:10.224 --> 00:02:14.893
many ways to make improvements
in the things that we promise.

37
00:02:14.893 --> 00:02:19.386
So a design system is clearly not the only
way for you to become more efficient.

38
00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:23.619
It's not the only way for you to be more
consistent, it's not the only way for

39
00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.964
there to be accessibility
spread around the organization.

40
00:02:26.964 --> 00:02:28.144
There's lots of ways
to see those benefits.

41
00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:32.924
So what we wanna try to do is show
that when things change with adoption,

42
00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:37.385
which is the left side of this,
we see changes or improvements, or

43
00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:40.507
not improvements,
on the right side of this.

44
00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:43.285
So that's the metrics that we promised,
okay?

45
00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:45.573
I can't tell you what to track, right?

46
00:02:45.573 --> 00:02:48.645
Here's a list, I mean, this is not
intended for you to read all of this.

47
00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:52.681
But there are thousands of
things you could track, okay?

48
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:53.302
Just a few,

49
00:02:53.302 --> 00:02:57.417
what are the percentage of products with
a level one grade A adaption, right?

50
00:02:57.417 --> 00:03:01.808
[LAUGH] That may be something that if
we can see that change, we can then

51
00:03:01.808 --> 00:03:06.674
correlate that to perhaps the velocity
of product or feature teams, okay?

52
00:03:06.674 --> 00:03:10.046
So you're looking for
two sides of this equation.

53
00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:14.563
And you're trying to say, as we see
this go, as we see this adoption change,

54
00:03:14.563 --> 00:03:19.498
this type of adoption metric change across
our teams, we also can expect to see these

55
00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:24.188
kinds of improvements in their data
that they're capturing about their work.

56
00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:26.052
All right, so, does this make sense?

57
00:03:26.052 --> 00:03:29.318
This concept of correlation
is kinda what you have to do,

58
00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:31.233
that's kinda your job, right?

59
00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:35.486
I do see a lot of design system teams
that think it's their job to track all

60
00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:38.554
of the stuff on the right for
their subscribers, and

61
00:03:38.554 --> 00:03:41.785
there is no way you could
possibly do that, all right?

62
00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:45.536
So this is where you almost kind
of reverse engineer it, right?

63
00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:49.184
Once you've got a subscriber and
you've defined your subscriber groups,

64
00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:52.491
you go to them and you find out what
are the things they already track?

65
00:03:52.491 --> 00:03:55.936
If you're asking them to start
tracking something now that's

66
00:03:55.936 --> 00:04:00.234
new that they never tracked before,
there's even more resistance, right?

67
00:04:00.234 --> 00:04:03.403
So start with the things
they are already measuring.

68
00:04:03.403 --> 00:04:07.563
And hopefully, if you followed sort of
this maturity model in the stage one,

69
00:04:07.563 --> 00:04:11.542
you're actually gathering baselines for
a lot of the stuff on the right.

70
00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:16.297
So you know what this data used to be,
you know what the average age of bug or

71
00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:20.002
feature requests was in each
of your subscriber groups.

72
00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:21.934
So now you can look to see that improve.

73
00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:25.459
The other thing that's really,
really important here

74
00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:29.144
is adding disciplines to
the design system team, right?

75
00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:34.152
So stage three is usually, if you're able
to kinda show some of those correlations,

76
00:04:34.152 --> 00:04:38.880
this is usually where your leadership
will say, all right, you've done well,

77
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.533
you kept a few of those promises,
good work.

78
00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:45.539
And then you can say back,
here's all the work we're trying to do,

79
00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.578
here's the backlog,
we have a lot to accomplish.

80
00:04:48.578 --> 00:04:53.115
And I think we can make a bigger impact,
but I need more people on my team.

81
00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:56.276
And so, this is challenging, right?

82
00:04:56.276 --> 00:05:00.342
Most teams, they see this, they get that
open position and they look at their

83
00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:04.496
existing team and they think, we need
to do more of what we're already doing.

84
00:05:04.496 --> 00:05:09.540
And they hire another designer or another
front end dev or something like this.

85
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.184
Maybe that is the case, but
I always try to challenge people to say

86
00:05:14.184 --> 00:05:18.753
design systems are for
way more than designers and developers.

87
00:05:18.753 --> 00:05:22.533
They're for every discipline, as we talked
about, that's involved in interface work.

88
00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:27.206
So think about all these other
potential roles that you could

89
00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:29.506
also be filling on your team.

90
00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:32.377
And in fact it doesn't hurt to
write a little job description for

91
00:05:32.377 --> 00:05:35.035
each of these and
take it to your leadership and say, look,

92
00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:37.132
this is what I think we actually need,
right?

93
00:05:37.132 --> 00:05:41.963
So now you might be showing them this
is actually in stage three we do

94
00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:44.467
have to get to that product mindset.

95
00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:46.568
So we need QA, we need a content lead,

96
00:05:46.568 --> 00:05:50.397
we need a support person [LAUGH]
there's a ton of work to be done there.

97
00:05:50.397 --> 00:05:55.288
So I would encourage you to branch out and
think about the open positions a little

98
00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:58.876
differently than maybe your
default sort of reaction is.

99
00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:03.010
A nice way to make this list for
your company cuz this is just my list,

100
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.421
you might look at your product or
feature teams and say,

101
00:06:06.421 --> 00:06:08.686
what are the disciplines they have?

102
00:06:08.686 --> 00:06:11.959
Okay, we already know
culturally there's support for

103
00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:15.451
us to have UX writers because
they are on our product teams.

104
00:06:15.451 --> 00:06:19.742
Or there's a whole group of folks who do
that work for us inside the organization.

105
00:06:19.742 --> 00:06:24.408
So you're gonna have a lot easier
time hiring from roles that already

106
00:06:24.408 --> 00:06:28.834
exist somewhere else in
the organization onto your system team,

107
00:06:28.834 --> 00:06:33.823
than trying to make the case that we need
to create a whole new role here that

108
00:06:33.823 --> 00:06:35.765
people will get it, right?

109
00:06:35.765 --> 00:06:38.284
They'll understand,
yeah you probably do need a product owner.

110
00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:44.564
[LAUGH] So think about that in terms of
how your organization is already set up.
