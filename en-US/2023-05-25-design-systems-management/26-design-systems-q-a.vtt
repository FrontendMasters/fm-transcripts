WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.524
&gt;&gt; Ben: I know that we said we would have
some time to kinda follow up with bigger

2
00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:05.250
questions here at the end too.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.078
So questions?

4
00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:07.630
Yeah, what's up?

5
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's the ideal size and
makeup of a design systems team?

6
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.428
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah, it's hard.

7
00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:18.640
I think that changes as
the system matures, I know that.

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.670
Usually, the perfect team for stage 1 is
not the perfect team for stages 2 and 3.

9
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.075
So I think that the team needs to grow,

10
00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:32.780
especially around in the areas
of customer support.

11
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.981
That's just an area where your design
system team needs to be really thinking

12
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:37.570
that through.

13
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.539
So around stage 2 and
3 is when I need to see those people

14
00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.182
being added to the team for
it to sort of be healthy.

15
00:00:45.182 --> 00:00:48.525
I mean, I know I was just at
Clarity at the end of last year,

16
00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:51.546
Clarity Conference,
it's a design system event.

17
00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:56.412
There was a really interesting
conversation happening among the attendees

18
00:00:56.412 --> 00:01:01.276
about how a lot of them feel so lonely
in this work, because they are, in many

19
00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:06.740
respects, the only person dedicated
to this inside their organization.

20
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.420
So there's a whole channel now created in
that design system Slack group that's just

21
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.047
designed system team of one.

22
00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:17.741
And, I mean, we see all these articles
from these big teams, right, and

23
00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:20.866
we read about how IBM is
doing this amazing work.

24
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:25.450
And they are, it's brilliant stuff, I love
it, but it's also not the norm [LAUGH].

25
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.030
So I love those articles,
I read all of those, and

26
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.490
I would definitely encourage
you to do the same.

27
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.519
But I would also say, you gotta be
realistic with what you can accomplish

28
00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:40.904
given the resources that have
been allocated in your context.

29
00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:45.851
I love this conceptual thinking, but I've
tried to make this more practical, but

30
00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:49.042
it's impossible,
because every system is unique.

31
00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:54.553
They're all different based on
the needs of the actual organization.

32
00:01:54.553 --> 00:01:59.414
So one thing that I can encourage you
to do if you're asking that question is

33
00:01:59.414 --> 00:02:03.736
to look at the different product teams or
feature teams or squads or

34
00:02:03.736 --> 00:02:05.842
however you break up your work.

35
00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:10.740
Look at the way those teams are structured
and at least use that as a model, okay?

36
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.207
That could be a way that would get
you into stage 3 pretty easily.

37
00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:19.680
So that might be something to think about.

38
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.860
I wish I had a number to give you, but
[LAUGH] it's not that easy [LAUGH].

39
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.100
Any other questions?

40
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.910
Or any aha moments, yeah, what's up?

41
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So what do you do
when you've got that stage 1,

42
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.642
stage 2 design system team, and

43
00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:40.889
kinda the resources that the team
is using to educate itself and

44
00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:46.837
to sort of try to create sort of a shoot
for are looking at Adobe's work.

45
00:02:46.837 --> 00:02:51.678
And they're looking at the Carbon's
work and they're like,

46
00:02:51.678 --> 00:02:55.020
yeah, well, this is how they do it.

47
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.700
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How do

48
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.413
you kinda rectify the fact that
your team probably can't do that?

49
00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:01.639
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah.

50
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: At least not at first.

51
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.965
&gt;&gt; Ben: Man, it's so hard.

52
00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:07.505
I mean, I have definitely been
guilty of that in the past.

53
00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:10.009
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's easy to
fall into that [COUGH].

54
00:03:12.717 --> 00:03:16.674
&gt;&gt; Ben: I think the cultural stuff
that I've been doing has helped me

55
00:03:16.674 --> 00:03:20.555
have conversations with
an organization about how, hey,

56
00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:24.374
we need to structure the approach
here based on who we are.

57
00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:28.031
So just that simple concept goes
a long way toward saying that that

58
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:32.952
work that Carbon did or that's in Spectrum
or whatever, those are great examples, but

59
00:03:32.952 --> 00:03:36.366
we have a different culture,
we have different skill sets.

60
00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.810
We have different experience levels here.

61
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.052
So also something like Spectrum and

62
00:03:42.052 --> 00:03:46.812
Adobe is a little bit more
externally oriented too.

63
00:03:46.812 --> 00:03:48.745
So it's kinda like, okay,
is that what we're doing?

64
00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:52.717
Are we trying to build something for
other people to build stuff with or

65
00:03:52.717 --> 00:03:55.491
are we trying to focus on something for
our team?

66
00:03:55.491 --> 00:04:00.183
So it's those kinds of conversations
that have helped sort of

67
00:04:00.183 --> 00:04:04.256
slowly move that dial, but
it's not a quick change.

68
00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:08.952
And it's also really possible to look at
those articles and read whatever and say,

69
00:04:08.952 --> 00:04:13.600
you know what, here's the thing we can
pull from this that will actually help us.

70
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.312
And maybe here's a few things
that probably don't apply, and

71
00:04:18.312 --> 00:04:21.640
to be sort of more vocal about
calling that stuff out instead of

72
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.590
posting the article and
not saying anything, right?

73
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.320
That, I think,
is actually really dangerous.

74
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.693
Cuz what are you communicating with that?

75
00:04:28.693 --> 00:04:31.759
You throw the article in the design
system channel or whatever,

76
00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.871
are you saying we should
all work like this?

77
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:35.957
Or are you just saying
this is interesting, or

78
00:04:35.957 --> 00:04:37.408
here's another perspective?

79
00:04:37.408 --> 00:04:39.767
So maybe a little bit more communication,

80
00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:43.436
a little bit more transparency
about your thinking for the piece,

81
00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:47.319
which requires you to get in and
actually read it [LAUGH] and dissect it.

82
00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.865
But I think that's where I would say don't
just willy-nilly throw that stuff around.

83
00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:55.904
Post it at the beginning and say, you
know what, I think this is brilliant, but

84
00:04:55.904 --> 00:04:59.582
we're not a system of systems, so
we're not gonna do what Spotify did or

85
00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:03.920
whatever, we've got to be more
controlling than that, and here's why.

86
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.266
But I love this little bit that they did,
this way that they sent so and

87
00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:10.480
so out to work on these product teams or
whatever.

88
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.540
So maybe there's nuggets you could pull,
I don't know if that would help, but yeah.

89
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.630
Another one online?

90
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.384
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I think this is probably
related, but what do you think about

91
00:05:19.384 --> 00:05:23.100
white-label component libraries,
like Microsoft's FAST or ING s Lion?

92
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.421
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah, I mean,

93
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:29.726
we were talking a little bit about
this over one of the breaks.

94
00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:36.199
[LAUGH] I think we've been in a lot of
situations where an organization started

95
00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.488
with another system as sort of
a starting point for their work.

96
00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:44.984
And they've come to us because they
feel like it's slowing them down and

97
00:05:44.984 --> 00:05:48.340
they need something that's
more of a custom fit for them.

98
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.437
So I'm definitely biased
by that experience.

99
00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:58.072
I'm sure there are systems out there that
have been built on those third party or

100
00:05:58.072 --> 00:06:01.026
white-label platforms or frameworks.

101
00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:04.281
I think it can be,
depending on where you are culturally,

102
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:08.798
if speed is the most important thing,
then maybe that's a great opportunity for

103
00:06:08.798 --> 00:06:12.200
you to kinda get a lot of
work done in a quick time.

104
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.087
I think I would just be conscious of the
debt that you're accumulating by making

105
00:06:16.087 --> 00:06:17.487
a choice like that, right?

106
00:06:17.487 --> 00:06:18.790
You don't get anything for free.

107
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.105
So what you're getting is
a lot of quick to market,

108
00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:26.884
we're gonna be able to make a lot of
progress in a short amount of time, but

109
00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:29.910
at what cost,
is the question you have to ask.

110
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.886
So in the future, if this thing
doesn't do what we need it to do,

111
00:06:33.886 --> 00:06:37.950
how hard will it be for us to yank
it out and replace it with our own?

112
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.500
That's the kinda questions
you've gotta ask.

113
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.967
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: One more,
is Storybook really good or what tools of,

114
00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:49.103
let me it right.

115
00:06:49.103 --> 00:06:50.331
&gt;&gt; Ben: That's all right, yeah.

116
00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:56.892
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What's your tool of
choice for tracking of a design,

117
00:06:56.892 --> 00:06:58.650
[SOUND] one more time.

118
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.350
I wanna nail this question.

119
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.862
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah, fine.

120
00:07:00.862 --> 00:07:04.611
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH] Do you like
Storybook, or what is your tool of choice

121
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:08.830
generally for keeping track of
a design system within a company?

122
00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:13.328
&gt;&gt; Ben: I always get this
question about tools, and

123
00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:18.865
I have intentionally left every reference
to tooling out of all 200 of these slides.

124
00:07:18.865 --> 00:07:24.760
[LAUGH] And that's because the tools are
gonna come and go, that's just the truth.

125
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.210
I want you to build something
that's not dependent on a tool.

126
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.612
I mean, this is so
bizarre to say cuz at one point,

127
00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:34.520
I was talking with our
creative director about this.

128
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.031
And I remember saying to him,

129
00:07:37.031 --> 00:07:41.858
we have to understand design
systems as an abstraction.

130
00:07:41.858 --> 00:07:44.810
We need to understand what
they are absent of any tool.

131
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.796
And he was like,
absent of any tool, what do I have?

132
00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:50.036
And we are just going back and
forth on this.

133
00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:52.430
And here's the problem, right?

134
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.872
I love Figma,
I think it's an incredible tool.

135
00:07:54.872 --> 00:07:59.539
They've done a ton of work to build
a really good community of folks who

136
00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:01.448
really love their product.

137
00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.634
They've built it in a way
that it's extendable,

138
00:08:03.634 --> 00:08:05.515
they've got a really cool architecture.

139
00:08:05.515 --> 00:08:09.424
I mean the collaborative stuff,
it's amazing.

140
00:08:09.424 --> 00:08:13.779
But if you only build your system in
Figma, you're fully dependent on somebody

141
00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:17.874
else's product to have a thing that
all of your products are dependent on.

142
00:08:17.874 --> 00:08:20.849
That's just not a healthy place to be, so

143
00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:26.387
I would encourage you to define the system
outside of the context of any tool.

144
00:08:26.387 --> 00:08:29.902
And then of course, you're gonna use
these tools to build the system but

145
00:08:29.902 --> 00:08:31.353
there's a thousand of them.

146
00:08:31.353 --> 00:08:33.337
There's I mean I love figma.

147
00:08:33.337 --> 00:08:35.253
We use sketch for a long time.

148
00:08:35.253 --> 00:08:39.447
I know folks who are using Adobe tools
like they're really good designed tool.

149
00:08:39.447 --> 00:08:43.004
We've definitely done a ton of
work with Storybook especially in

150
00:08:43.004 --> 00:08:47.403
our react projects, but there's lots of
other options there's tons of tooling

151
00:08:47.403 --> 00:08:49.614
around like zero height and supernova.

152
00:08:49.614 --> 00:08:52.948
And plugins for
Figma that lets you manage your tokens and

153
00:08:52.948 --> 00:08:57.061
all of this stuff it's like really
starting to kind of bloom and grow.

154
00:08:57.061 --> 00:09:01.821
And you're gonna be faced with making
choices about how much these things cost,

155
00:09:01.821 --> 00:09:06.792
what's the debt that I'm getting into by
aligning myself with this way of working.

156
00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:12.188
So I would just say, I think there's great
value in almost every tool that I've seen.

157
00:09:12.188 --> 00:09:13.723
I've been like,
that's actually really cool.

158
00:09:13.723 --> 00:09:14.865
I love that they did that.

159
00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:19.661
[LAUGH] Just try to make sure
you're also thinking about

160
00:09:19.661 --> 00:09:23.216
what happens when we shift away from it?

161
00:09:23.216 --> 00:09:27.992
So I'm sorry that I'm just not gonna
answer that question in the way that

162
00:09:27.992 --> 00:09:32.772
it's asked but we've had great success
with storybook if that's a tool

163
00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:35.851
you wanna use for
sure if it fits your context.

164
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:39.031
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: How granular should
you make the design system?

165
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:43.594
One of the things we're struggling with
right now is do we designing component for

166
00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:45.457
kind of its worst case scenario.

167
00:09:45.457 --> 00:09:50.271
Or do we design the component for,
the 90% of the time use case and

168
00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:53.322
try to avoid, bike shedding at all costs?

169
00:09:53.322 --> 00:09:57.649
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah, I mean,
you can definitely get too into the weeds.

170
00:09:57.649 --> 00:10:02.449
I think, there's definitely the model
where you're kind of looking at, I guess

171
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:07.334
in general, my approach to this is to
say like, what's the commonality, right?

172
00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:10.760
So let's look across all of
our subscriber groups and

173
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.724
whatever this component is in their
context, what's the overlap, right?

174
00:10:15.724 --> 00:10:21.459
So that means you're gonna be
building less in your system?

175
00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:26.278
But for you to do that, you also have to
then think through how those subscriber

176
00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:31.182
teams can take that core piece and turn
it into something that fits their model.

177
00:10:31.182 --> 00:10:36.127
So I think that's a better approach
personally than trying to build

178
00:10:36.127 --> 00:10:41.433
a single component that can transform
into all these different things.

179
00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:43.734
That's my personal opinion there.

180
00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:48.018
And there's probably situations where
I would recommend something different,

181
00:10:48.018 --> 00:10:49.392
but does that make sense?

182
00:10:49.392 --> 00:10:50.157
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Yeah, no, absolutely.

183
00:10:50.157 --> 00:10:52.393
And then kind of as a follow up,

184
00:10:52.393 --> 00:10:58.155
how close should the representation of
a component in code be to the component in

185
00:10:58.155 --> 00:11:03.235
whatever creative software of choice
that you're using at the time?

186
00:11:03.235 --> 00:11:05.236
So for me, Figma.

187
00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:09.800
We have our product design team that
likes to build our very elaborate

188
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.127
prototypes in Figma to show to
stakeholders, what have you, but

189
00:11:14.127 --> 00:11:17.842
there's just a lot of limitations
with how you can get.

190
00:11:17.842 --> 00:11:22.982
Let's say, a date picker with
the drop-down calendar and a whole bunch

191
00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:28.134
of secondary interactions inside of
it to look exactly like in the code.

192
00:11:28.134 --> 00:11:31.153
So there is a little bit of disconnect for
us right now, but that's more so

193
00:11:31.153 --> 00:11:32.956
just because from a technical standpoint,

194
00:11:32.956 --> 00:11:35.217
it doesn't make sense,
at least from my standpoint.

195
00:11:35.217 --> 00:11:40.278
Sorry, from my perspective
to spend time that could

196
00:11:40.278 --> 00:11:45.231
otherwise be spent building
the component out in.

197
00:11:45.231 --> 00:11:49.301
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah, [COUGH] so your question
was how close should they be?

198
00:11:49.301 --> 00:11:52.218
And I would say they should
be very close [COUGH].

199
00:11:52.218 --> 00:11:55.257
I think they should be the same.

200
00:11:55.257 --> 00:11:56.800
That's the ideal.

201
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.940
But what I would say to the sort of
further explanation of what you described

202
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.700
is that's actually not
a design system problem,

203
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.085
that's just a workflow problem, right?

204
00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:10.710
You have a separation between design and
development.

205
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.116
And you can't have that, you have to
have those people working together.

206
00:12:14.116 --> 00:12:18.323
So the result would be maybe there's
a front end developer that's helping in

207
00:12:18.323 --> 00:12:23.063
the development of this prototype, even
though they're not actually coding it out.

208
00:12:23.063 --> 00:12:26.005
They're just like sitting there
working with those folks and

209
00:12:26.005 --> 00:12:28.562
pairing with them as they're
developing a concept.

210
00:12:28.562 --> 00:12:33.485
You wouldn't wanna sell
something that you can't build.

211
00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:35.443
So you gotta be careful with that.

212
00:12:35.443 --> 00:12:38.933
For a long time,my organization,

213
00:12:38.933 --> 00:12:43.129
we just didn't have those distinctions.

214
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:46.567
And when we first started,
it was even more extreme.

215
00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:50.489
We were just all in one room, it was a
small group, and we were all literally our

216
00:12:50.489 --> 00:12:54.483
title, every single person was developer,
whether we were a designer or not.

217
00:12:54.483 --> 00:12:56.953
And we thought of ourselves as just,

218
00:12:56.953 --> 00:13:00.787
the end product is the digital
thing we're delivering.

219
00:13:00.787 --> 00:13:03.912
For us at that time,
it was a lot of website stuff.

220
00:13:03.912 --> 00:13:07.476
And so we just blurred the lines.

221
00:13:07.476 --> 00:13:11.411
And that has kind of, that's like
foundationally where we came from.

222
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:13.979
And I think that sort of stayed with us.

223
00:13:13.979 --> 00:13:16.255
And we definitely have distinct roles now.

224
00:13:16.255 --> 00:13:20.438
But we have a lot of overlap,
and we don't put those people,

225
00:13:20.438 --> 00:13:23.239
those disciplines on work on their own.

226
00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:27.124
It doesn't work, it results in what
you're describing all the time and

227
00:13:27.124 --> 00:13:29.297
it's just frustrating for everybody.

228
00:13:29.297 --> 00:13:31.919
So I don't like the idea
of handoffs at all.

229
00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:35.196
I'd rather we're just sort
of cycling through together.

230
00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:40.114
Again, that's a cultural change though,
that may be a big organization shift for

231
00:13:40.114 --> 00:13:42.726
you to have to require
something like that.

232
00:13:42.726 --> 00:13:45.520
The system team could perhaps model it,
right?

233
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:51.405
So as you get an opportunity to build out
that team, don't just hire designers.

234
00:13:51.405 --> 00:13:55.779
Bring in the different disciplines so that
you can actually work on these problems,

235
00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:58.621
solving them in really good,
healthy ways together.

236
00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:05.315
That then becomes a model for
how other teams could operate.

237
00:14:05.315 --> 00:14:11.142
That whole designer developer thing is
still so, it's so entrenched, and it's

238
00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:16.133
back to just the way our organizations
are structured in a lot of ways.

239
00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:17.559
It's super unfortunate.

240
00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:19.398
I wish it wasn't still like that.

241
00:14:19.398 --> 00:14:26.450
But I definitely see design systems
as a way to kind of get at that.

242
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.197
Yeah.

243
00:14:29.197 --> 00:14:32.202
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Could you share your
personal inputs regarding component types?

244
00:14:32.202 --> 00:14:38.685
For example, Atomic Design by Brad Frost
assumes atoms, molecules, organisms, etc.

245
00:14:38.685 --> 00:14:43.389
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah, Brad's work is
foundational to everything that we're

246
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:45.881
doing right now in the industry.

247
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:50.659
I am so glad that he published that
work and has used it with such success.

248
00:14:50.659 --> 00:14:53.549
We've definitely done projects,

249
00:14:53.549 --> 00:14:58.953
especially early in our systems
work where we took that approach.

250
00:14:58.953 --> 00:15:02.431
We've used pattern lab in the past,
and we've had good success with it.

251
00:15:02.431 --> 00:15:08.713
I think we've gotten away from it because
in some cases the language of atoms and

252
00:15:08.713 --> 00:15:13.306
molecules, and all that stuff,
has kind of gotten more in

253
00:15:13.306 --> 00:15:18.400
the way of communicating with
folks than I think was necessary.

254
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.085
So the approach that personally
that we kind of ascribe to

255
00:15:23.085 --> 00:15:27.866
now is kind of what I showed with
the anatomy is that we think

256
00:15:27.866 --> 00:15:32.472
that components can be simple,
or they can be complex.

257
00:15:32.472 --> 00:15:35.851
So, you can have a component that is very,
very simple, a label.

258
00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:40.072
You can also combine that,
with a button and an input, and

259
00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:42.755
now you have a search bar component.

260
00:15:42.755 --> 00:15:46.938
And, so that the simple idea of just
we can nest these things to create more

261
00:15:46.938 --> 00:15:49.775
complexity I think is all
that's really needed.

262
00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:54.633
And that's really the root of what the
atomic model is trying to communicate so

263
00:15:54.633 --> 00:15:58.252
regardless of what you call
call those different layers.

264
00:15:58.252 --> 00:16:01.230
Or if you even need to
call them something,

265
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.533
I don't really care as long as
you're gaining the idea that we

266
00:16:05.533 --> 00:16:09.281
can increase complexity by
combining these things.

267
00:16:11.843 --> 00:16:13.239
What's up?

268
00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:14.519
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: So
this big picture question.

269
00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:15.190
&gt;&gt; Ben: Okay.

270
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.737
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: So
you spent a lot of time researching,

271
00:16:18.737 --> 00:16:23.693
thinking about all this
stuff around design systems.

272
00:16:23.693 --> 00:16:27.305
As you've compiled all of that knowledge,

273
00:16:27.305 --> 00:16:32.781
do you have any thoughts on kind
of where things are going, right?

274
00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:35.991
Are there any things that
you've seen where you say,

275
00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:39.497
this seems like a natural
evolution from where we are now?

276
00:16:39.497 --> 00:16:42.454
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah, I mean, that's interesting.

277
00:16:42.454 --> 00:16:45.412
I definitely think about this a lot,

278
00:16:45.412 --> 00:16:49.619
especially with all the stuff
happening around AI.

279
00:16:49.619 --> 00:16:55.002
Before a lot of that, before mid journey
and some of the stuff from Adobe and

280
00:16:55.002 --> 00:16:59.375
all these other kind of text to
image type things happening.

281
00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:04.384
I was thinking about how,
there's a bunch of books that are old

282
00:17:04.384 --> 00:17:10.720
architectural books on systems that I've
been kinda just thumbing through and

283
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.517
they do this even back in Roman times and
stuff.

284
00:17:14.517 --> 00:17:18.076
There's all these books about architecture
where they just lay out all the patterns.

285
00:17:18.076 --> 00:17:21.426
They say, in this scenario where you have
the water here and the sun's rising on

286
00:17:21.426 --> 00:17:24.626
this side, we wanna make sure we think
about the window placement here, and

287
00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:25.826
the breeze, and all these.

288
00:17:25.826 --> 00:17:28.804
And they've literally
thought it through and

289
00:17:28.804 --> 00:17:33.240
kind of codified their style of
architecture from that time period.

290
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.596
And it's cool,
the books also have a lot of examples,

291
00:17:37.596 --> 00:17:43.479
you can see these old structures,
some of them still standing or almost.

292
00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:49.117
And it's really neat to see how those
things were actually put into practice.

293
00:17:49.117 --> 00:17:52.997
I love the idea that we could
find ways to be a little bit

294
00:17:52.997 --> 00:17:57.828
more explicit about the rules and
the guidelines for our systems so

295
00:17:57.828 --> 00:18:02.155
that we could trust more
generative type things to happen.

296
00:18:02.155 --> 00:18:04.956
I think there is critique.

297
00:18:04.956 --> 00:18:09.241
This happens with every movement,
especially in interface work where,

298
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:13.455
when responsive happened, I remember
all the articles that were like,

299
00:18:13.455 --> 00:18:17.762
responsive web designs is killing our
creativity on the web or whatever.

300
00:18:17.762 --> 00:18:19.599
Same thing is happening with systems,
right?

301
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.559
Systematic approach removes
all the creativity.

302
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:25.197
Well, that's just BS to me.

303
00:18:25.197 --> 00:18:28.030
It's like,
what problems do you wanna solve, right?

304
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.632
Do you wanna solve the border radius
problem again, come on, good grief,

305
00:18:32.632 --> 00:18:33.226
move on.

306
00:18:33.226 --> 00:18:38.377
So, solve those problems, solve them well,
move on to the new challenges.

307
00:18:38.377 --> 00:18:42.832
But I love the idea that we could
articulate the sort of big picture

308
00:18:42.832 --> 00:18:47.611
guidelines so well that we could then
trust the system to generate a new

309
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:51.752
color palette for us, or
whatever it is that we want it to do.

310
00:18:51.752 --> 00:18:56.288
So, I definitely think there's
people doing that stuff now.

311
00:18:56.288 --> 00:18:59.539
We'll see how it plays out in
terms of its usability, and

312
00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:03.087
if it's actually helpful, or
if it creates more confusion.

313
00:19:03.087 --> 00:19:07.438
I definitely think there's
also a trend toward, well,

314
00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:12.331
I guess early on, we got this big
idea of what a system could be and

315
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:16.796
we thought,
let's build a system that does everything.

316
00:19:16.796 --> 00:19:21.301
[LAUGH] And so, systems got
wildly complex, really fast, and

317
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:24.081
a lot of them fell apart because of it.

318
00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:27.353
There is a lot happening here,
there's a lot to maintain.

319
00:19:27.353 --> 00:19:31.960
So, I definitely think there's a trend
where people have been through that pain

320
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.786
and they're pulling back, they're scaling
way back in what their system offers.

321
00:19:36.786 --> 00:19:41.412
And they're choosing to offer things
that are really high quality,

322
00:19:41.412 --> 00:19:46.278
that are well done, really well done
pieces that become then the bedrock

323
00:19:46.278 --> 00:19:51.082
of a lot of product work instead of
being the fancy stuff on the surface.

324
00:19:51.082 --> 00:19:56.781
So, I think that definite movement
towards doing less is something I like.

325
00:19:56.781 --> 00:19:59.823
And it's enabling for
your teams too, right?

326
00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:03.520
For your subscribers to feel like okay,
I got the stuff I need, I got my type and

327
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.218
my colors and
I don't wanna mess with that stuff anyway.

328
00:20:06.218 --> 00:20:08.470
Let me just build the actual experience.

329
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:14.080
So, that can be a really good, I think,
shift that we're starting to see.
