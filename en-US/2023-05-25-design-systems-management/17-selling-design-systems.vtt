00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.999
So I'm reading this book, maybe some
of you are reading this as well,

2
00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:09.678
it's Rick Rubin's new book,
The Creative Act: A Way of Being.

3
00:00:09.678 --> 00:00:13.193
And this is kinda the last
concept I wanna share in stage 3,

4
00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:15.809
and it's about how to sell design systems.

5
00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.265
Now I'll just read you this little quote.

6
00:00:19.265 --> 00:00:26.006
He says, turning something from an idea
into a reality can make it seem smaller.

7
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:30.111
It changes from unearthly to earthly.

8
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:32.832
The imagination has no limits.

9
00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:37.728
The physical world does, but
the work exists in both.

10
00:00:37.728 --> 00:00:40.563
And I think when I read this, for

11
00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:46.668
me it solidified sort of a little bit
of a model or a process that I use.

12
00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:50.885
Because a lot of my job is talking
to leaders inside organizations.

13
00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:54.529
So I may do some coaching with
a design system lead but inevitably,

14
00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:58.447
they need to interact with their
executives and they need to get buy in.

15
00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:02.406
And the way that I do that is
actually [LAUGH] very closely aligned

16
00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:05.106
with this little section from Rick Rubin.

17
00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:09.451
I know that none of you probably signed
up as a designer, a developer or

18
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:11.524
whatever, to be a salesperson.

19
00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:13.793
[LAUGH] And unfortunately,

20
00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:18.729
I just I don't know of another
way to do design system work.

21
00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.764
It is a 100% part of the job.

22
00:01:21.764 --> 00:01:25.448
And so if you wanna be successful
in design system stuff,

23
00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:29.994
you've got to learn how to speak to
executives and how to sell to them.

24
00:01:29.994 --> 00:01:33.920
So let me tell you kind
of how I use this little,

25
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.900
almost like a poem from Rick Rubin, in my
concept around selling a design system.

26
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.640
So, with a design system
what we're trying to do and

27
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.230
with any process, what we're really,
what we should expect,

28
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.918
is that we should have a periodic
check in with our stakeholders.

29
00:01:53.918 --> 00:01:57.726
And in those conversations,
they're gonna expect to see more and

30
00:01:57.726 --> 00:01:59.972
more value created over time, right?

31
00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:03.706
So each time that I sit down maybe
this is quarterly, or monthly, or

32
00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.931
whatever your cadence is,
each time I sit down with them.

33
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:11.161
I should plan to be able to show here's
where we've created value based on

34
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:12.948
the investment you've made.

35
00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:15.049
And here's where we're headed, right?

36
00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.423
Now, if we plot out sort of Rick Rubin's
idea of the idea versus the reality,

37
00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:22.821
or the unearthly and the earthly,

38
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:26.975
we might get something that
looks kinda like this, right?

39
00:02:26.975 --> 00:02:29.804
So the thing that I'm selling, this idea,

40
00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:33.322
this sort of aspirational concept,
is always ahead,

41
00:02:33.322 --> 00:02:37.765
it's always a little bit better [LAUGH],
than where we actually are.

42
00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:40.767
And that very first day,
on the vertical line of value there,

43
00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:42.170
we've got nothing to show.

44
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.704
We have zero value, right?

45
00:02:43.704 --> 00:02:47.251
But I'm sitting down and I'm pitching
to them, that star right above me, and

46
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:49.909
I'm saying, look,
this is where we're going, right?

47
00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:55.516
This is the idea, the concept, the
aspiration, and what happens is over time,

48
00:02:55.516 --> 00:03:01.136
in reality, we're gonna work now over
time, to build something close to that.

49
00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:03.505
But very quickly, we'll start to plateau.

50
00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:05.181
And as the design system lead,

51
00:03:05.181 --> 00:03:08.607
it's your job to identify what
that next big thing is, right?

52
00:03:08.607 --> 00:03:15.284
You've gotta be thinking ahead,
you have to be, way out thinking ahead.

53
00:03:15.284 --> 00:03:17.789
This is where you're pitching, right?

54
00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:21.495
So we can actually break this
whole thing down right here.

55
00:03:21.495 --> 00:03:25.657
In the next meeting, what I wanna do is
be able to say, this is where we were.

56
00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:29.892
This is the structure of a pitch
that I would make to my leadership.

57
00:03:29.892 --> 00:03:33.334
I would say,
this is where we were last time we met.

58
00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:37.827
And last time we met, I told you,
this is what we would do.

59
00:03:37.827 --> 00:03:42.153
And you invested in me, you invested
in this idea, you were part of this.

60
00:03:42.153 --> 00:03:45.774
And now, this is where we are, right?

61
00:03:45.774 --> 00:03:47.893
We've made great progress.

62
00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:52.972
We've moved our way toward that
aspirational thing that you invested in,

63
00:03:52.972 --> 00:03:55.483
and it took us this much time to do so.

64
00:03:55.483 --> 00:03:58.856
And also, by the way, hey,
we made some really good progress,

65
00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:00.863
don't forget to call this out [LAUGH].

66
00:04:00.863 --> 00:04:04.629
And right on the heels of that,
you have to have ready for

67
00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.124
them what the next thing is, right?

68
00:04:07.124 --> 00:04:11.641
This is what we could achieve
together in our next phase of work.

69
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:16.569
And it's sort of breaking this
concept down into little tiny steps.

70
00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:20.646
So that what you're doing early on is,
maybe it's a little ask, and

71
00:04:20.646 --> 00:04:24.390
you're getting a little amount
of time to show a little value.

72
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.363
But over time you can start to
take larger risks with that,

73
00:04:27.363 --> 00:04:31.016
and you can earn the trust of those
folks who are investing in this work.

74
00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:32.729
And you can start to see real progress.

75
00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.211
They will begin trusting you with this
stuff if you can show a few of this

76
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:40.124
iterations, where you are actually
meeting the goals you've set with them.

77
00:04:40.124 --> 00:04:41.894
It's a trust building exercise and

78
00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:45.144
it takes time just like everything
else [LAUGH] in design systems.

79
00:04:45.144 --> 00:04:48.238
It's definitely possible to overpromise,
right?

80
00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:53.278
So, I mentioned it's good to start small,
but it's also really good for

81
00:04:53.278 --> 00:04:57.195
you to think about that way,
way out in the future point.

82
00:04:57.195 --> 00:05:00.412
And you're probably gonna be wrong, about
what that is that you're building, right?

83
00:05:00.412 --> 00:05:03.502
But it's good to get those
ideas out of your head,

84
00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:06.753
that really big sky kind of dream stuff,
get it out.

85
00:05:06.753 --> 00:05:11.084
And then you can kinda extrapolate
back down to what makes sense in

86
00:05:11.084 --> 00:05:12.192
the short term.

87
00:05:12.192 --> 00:05:15.302
And that end point is gonna shift and
change.

88
00:05:15.302 --> 00:05:20.025
And definitely, you've gotta be
careful about over promising here.

89
00:05:20.025 --> 00:05:22.876
And there's lots of other factors
that can come in to play here.

90
00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:27.014
So this is, again, the idea realistic
model that you're aiming for.

91
00:05:27.014 --> 00:05:30.129
But if you're having trouble
shorten the iterations, right?

92
00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.486
Try to get a few more conversations with
them, make smaller promises to start and

93
00:05:34.486 --> 00:05:37.193
then sort of build up to
making these larger ones.
