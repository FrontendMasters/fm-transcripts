00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.001
Another thing that happens a lot in stage
three is, in fact there's a conversation

2
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:09.730
about this usually early on, especially
in engineering led design systems.

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.436
And that's when the dev team, or
the engineering team says look,

4
00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:19.491
your designs are all over the place,
we need some way of roping this in.

5
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:21.415
And so we want consistency, so

6
00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:26.528
we're gonna build a system that creates
consistency out of the chaos you give us.

7
00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:31.558
[LAUGH] And what happens is early on
usually a few designers are like, my gosh,

8
00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:33.373
what are you talking about?

9
00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:37.803
The design system is gonna take my job
away, it's gonna do the job for me.

10
00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:41.421
What do I even need to be here for if all
of the things we've designed are just in

11
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:43.825
the system and
I don't need to do the work anymore?

12
00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:50.980
That's usually a conversation that
maybe surfaces briefly early on, but

13
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.407
stage three is where it
really rears its head.

14
00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:57.782
And that's because now people
are actually using this thing and

15
00:00:57.782 --> 00:01:02.157
they're getting to feel the rub here,
they feel does the system

16
00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:06.227
force me into consistency or
does it offer me flexibility?

17
00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:09.910
And I actually hate this
slide [LAUGH] in my deck,

18
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.264
because I actually don't think that
this is an either or situation.

19
00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:19.423
I like to think about it more like this,
I can have an inflexible system or

20
00:01:19.423 --> 00:01:21.139
I can have a flexible system.

21
00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:24.006
I can create inconsistent
output in my products, or

22
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.623
I can create consistent
output in my products.

23
00:01:26.623 --> 00:01:29.239
All of these are possible,
all of these quadrants.

24
00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.813
Nobody wants to be in the bottom left,
right,

25
00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:34.593
inconsistent output with
an inflexible system.

26
00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:38.461
So we're gonna ignore that one, we're
gonna assume that at least you've got

27
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:41.459
something happening in top left,
right, or bottom right.

28
00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.234
But let's talk a little bit
about these quadrants, okay.

29
00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:50.470
In the top left we've got
a really flexible system, but

30
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.269
that's resulting in very
inconsistent output.

31
00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:56.957
So the system lets you
do anything you want and

32
00:01:56.957 --> 00:02:01.083
people are doing anything they want,
[LAUGH] this is not a good place.

33
00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:04.347
There's unclear or
no guidelines maybe in that system.

34
00:02:04.347 --> 00:02:08.440
There are processes not really open for
conversation, they're pretty closed.

35
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.246
There's poor or no governance,
that means we're not testing,

36
00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:12.581
we haven't defined quality.

37
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:15.618
And maybe there's a false
sense of trust here.

38
00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:19.004
Because I've said hey,
the system is flexible,

39
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:23.612
I trust you to do with it what you want,
but the results are not good.

40
00:02:23.612 --> 00:02:26.337
I kind of think of this as
like that Wild West culture.

41
00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:30.557
Now in the bottom right we've
got consistent output, but

42
00:02:30.557 --> 00:02:33.583
the system itself is really inflexible.

43
00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:38.188
So we're forcing consistency
upon people with

44
00:02:38.188 --> 00:02:42.799
a really rigid system,
an inflexible system.

45
00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.713
So this, instead of sort of
that false sense of trust,

46
00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:49.616
this I think of as more
of a lack of trust.

47
00:02:49.616 --> 00:02:54.390
You've removed flexibility, you've
taken away my ability to do the things,

48
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.163
from my perception as a designer perhaps,
that I need to do, so

49
00:02:58.163 --> 00:03:00.963
I'm not contributing, you don't trust me.

50
00:03:00.963 --> 00:03:06.644
And this is a really kind of a space
of just creative frustration for

51
00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:10.811
folks on the design research
UX side of the work.

52
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.760
Of course, what we want is a really
flexible system that enables people to not

53
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.860
have that frustration experience,
to have real trust, and

54
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.442
we want them to create
consistent output with it.

55
00:03:20.442 --> 00:03:20.989
[LAUGH] So

56
00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.075
that's where we we do things with our
system that are very clear guidelines.

57
00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:29.414
Open processes,
there's a lot more transparency.

58
00:03:29.414 --> 00:03:34.250
We've taken the time to actually define
governance, what does quality mean for us,

59
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.005
and we've defined that well.

60
00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:38.568
Perhaps that lives at
the foundational level,

61
00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:41.836
even in something like our
design principles or values, and

62
00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:45.954
it filters all the way up through
everything, all the way up to components.

63
00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:48.962
There's a high level of trust
here that the team is unified.

64
00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:54.539
And the organization values consistency,
so the culture creates consistency.

65
00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:59.716
And this is where i kind of
land with systems like this,

66
00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:03.332
I think I would say that you need both.

67
00:04:03.332 --> 00:04:06.556
You need flexibility, your system does
need to be flexible because things

68
00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:09.482
are gonna change and your system
has to be able to accommodate that.

69
00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:13.018
But of course you want your products to
be more consistent and more cohesive.

70
00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:17.572
So your system has to enable that
creativity, it has to be flexible, but

71
00:04:17.572 --> 00:04:20.269
your culture has to encourage restraint.

72
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.712
And that's the way that you're
able to create something that

73
00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:27.104
actually offers a lot of value and

74
00:04:27.104 --> 00:04:31.817
has really a lot of breadth in
terms of what its capabilities are.

75
00:04:31.817 --> 00:04:35.197
I've written a lot more about this
here at this article on our blog,

76
00:04:35.197 --> 00:04:38.300
it's just The Myth of
Creative Restraint in Design Systems.

77
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.659
So in the notes you'll be able to
go take a peek at this if that's

78
00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.073
of interest to you.
