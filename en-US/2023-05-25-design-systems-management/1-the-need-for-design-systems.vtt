1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.807
Let's get started.

2
00:00:00.807 --> 00:00:03.684
And I'll actually begin
with a quick story.

3
00:00:03.684 --> 00:00:08.324
At the end of 2021,
I led two consulting engagements

4
00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:12.298
with two very large
enterprise organizations.

5
00:00:12.298 --> 00:00:16.426
Both of these companies were
I don't know how to say it.

6
00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:20.856
They were huge organizations,
billions of dollars in revenue.

7
00:00:20.856 --> 00:00:23.495
They both have had design systems for
years.

8
00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:26.081
They both had fully dedicated teams.

9
00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:29.587
They had real budgets established,
real timelines.

10
00:00:29.587 --> 00:00:32.247
They actually had folks that
were subscribing to the system.

11
00:00:32.247 --> 00:00:32.942
They had all of it.

12
00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:33.979
It was all going.

13
00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:36.571
But they were both also
feeling some frustration.

14
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.935
They felt like they were stuck in
the maturity of their systems.

15
00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:42.586
And so, they hired us to come and
to just do an assessment and

16
00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:47.187
help them sorta understand where are they
and what have they missed that's

17
00:00:47.187 --> 00:00:51.007
keeping them from being able to
move forward in a healthy way?

18
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:55.512
And so when we take on that kinda work
usually it starts with just a discovery

19
00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:56.166
process.

20
00:00:56.166 --> 00:01:00.434
So we sat down and did interviews with
probably I don't know as as many people as

21
00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:03.225
we could get [LAUGH] at each
of these organizations.

22
00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:08.180
We talked with their leadership, we talked
with folks on their design system teams

23
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.576
and we even spent a lot of time
talking with subscribers or

24
00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:13.801
consumers of their design systems.

25
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:17.901
And we learned a ton of
stuff from all these folks.

26
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:22.571
And I will say that completing these two
consulting engagements kinda running in

27
00:01:22.571 --> 00:01:27.116
parallel the at the end of that year,
it left me with two really big takeaways.

28
00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:32.056
The first takeaway is that there's
still a lot of confusion out there

29
00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:34.367
about what design systems are.

30
00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:38.935
Every person that I talked to inside
both of these companies had a different

31
00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:39.812
definition.

32
00:01:39.812 --> 00:01:43.441
They had a different idea
of why they were doing it.

33
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:46.488
They had different benefits they
were hoping to get from it.

34
00:01:46.488 --> 00:01:50.808
And it just really made me realize that
even inside very large organizations that

35
00:01:50.808 --> 00:01:54.059
from the outside it seems like
they've got it all together.

36
00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:57.633
When you get in there,
folks are still trying to figure this out.

37
00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:00.186
They just there's a lot
of confusion still.

38
00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:02.828
So that was my kinda first big takeaway.

39
00:02:02.828 --> 00:02:07.284
And the second was that almost all
the teams I've interacted with feel like

40
00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:11.678
they're not fully getting the benefit
of a systematic design practice.

41
00:02:11.678 --> 00:02:14.512
You spend all this time and
all this money and

42
00:02:14.512 --> 00:02:19.338
all this energy putting this thing in
place, building these processes and

43
00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:23.643
writing documentation and
creating a really good usable system.

44
00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:27.039
And in the end when you try to measure
this stuff it's really hard to show

45
00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.693
that it was worth the investment.

46
00:02:28.693 --> 00:02:34.161
So these two takeaways kinda left me
feeling like, we at least me at Spark box.

47
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:38.325
I hadn't done a good job
explaining systems to our clients.

48
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.234
And so I spent about a year and

49
00:02:40.234 --> 00:02:44.300
a half looking at every design
system I could get my hands on.

50
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.315
And what I found is I kinda needed to take
information from all of these sources and

51
00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:52.414
lots of interviews to kinda
pull together what for

52
00:02:52.414 --> 00:02:56.645
me has become kinda stake in the ground
when we do work with clients.

53
00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:59.716
We try to sit them down and
say, here's the big picture and

54
00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:02.232
that's kinda what I wanna
share with you here.

55
00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:05.724
And any good definition has
to start with the context.

56
00:03:05.724 --> 00:03:10.097
So for a design system the our
context looks kinda like this.

57
00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:13.613
Every organization Is trying
to connect its brand to some

58
00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:16.331
audience right at a very, very high level.

59
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:17.798
This is what companies are trying to do.

60
00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:20.839
[LAUGH] And they do that in
a ton of different ways, right?

61
00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:25.220
Sometimes they print stuff shows up in my
mailbox, even though I never asked for it.

62
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.481
[LAUGH] Sometimes they make amazing
in store experiences, right?

63
00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:32.784
They're trying to sorta transfer their

64
00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:36.771
brand in the physical
world to their customers.

65
00:03:36.771 --> 00:03:39.001
Sometimes they do advertising.

66
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:43.464
I listen to a lot of podcasts and
so now I'm tuned in to

67
00:03:43.464 --> 00:03:48.042
podcast advertisements more
than I have in the past.

68
00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:53.030
And pretty much every organization today
has a major touchpoint of their digital

69
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.989
experiences.

70
00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.348
So things like websites or
native applications, kiosks,

71
00:03:58.348 --> 00:04:02.894
lots of different places where
a digital interface can live.

72
00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:06.566
And I think that this kinda gives
us the context for design system.

73
00:04:06.566 --> 00:04:11.744
Your system has to sit between your
brand and the digital experiences

74
00:04:11.744 --> 00:04:17.823
that we design, build and deploy in order
to connect with the desired audience.

75
00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:22.646
I think this context is really important
because it helps us to understand

76
00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:26.862
the inputs and the outputs of
a really effective design system.

77
00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:31.220
Our systems are fed by the overarching
brand identity, the mission, the vision,

78
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.718
the values, all of that stuff right
that lives at the brand level.

79
00:04:34.718 --> 00:04:38.532
And they have to take everything
that's offered at the brand level.

80
00:04:38.532 --> 00:04:42.970
And all the stuff from that that's
needed to conceptualize, prototype,

81
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.134
design and build digital interfaces
across platforms and channels.

82
00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:50.504
That's kinda what they have
to offer on the output side.

83
00:04:50.504 --> 00:04:55.839
In this context also helps you to
decide your first big question,

84
00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:59.924
which is do I actually need
a design system right?

85
00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:04.720
Now I like to break this question down
in a couple of ways there's sorta

86
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.703
two main factors that I think about,
those two are scale and longevity.

87
00:05:09.703 --> 00:05:11.976
Let's talk really quickly
about each of these.

88
00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:15.864
So on the scale side,
there's this idea of organizational scale.

89
00:05:15.864 --> 00:05:19.074
Of course,
we're thinking about the number of teams,

90
00:05:19.074 --> 00:05:22.712
but there's a lot more than just
the size of the organization.

91
00:05:22.712 --> 00:05:24.778
There's also the complexity
of the organization.

92
00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:26.591
How are those teams structured?

93
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:29.341
Also, the maturity, this is a huge deal.

94
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:32.697
How skilled are the individuals that
you have inside your organization?

95
00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:36.897
If you have a single team that's
made up of really skilled,

96
00:05:36.897 --> 00:05:41.272
high experienced folks,
you probably don't need a system.

97
00:05:41.272 --> 00:05:44.686
That one team with really good folks
are gonna be able to figure out how to do

98
00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:46.685
the work you need to do
in an efficient way.

99
00:05:46.685 --> 00:05:49.357
They're gonna create really
cohesive experiences.

100
00:05:49.357 --> 00:05:53.458
So that's a situation where a small scale
with really mature folks probably means

101
00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:55.132
you don't need this, you know?

102
00:05:55.132 --> 00:06:00.656
But if you've got a scale really good
design across a complex organization with

103
00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:06.436
a variety of skill levels, well that's
a scenario where a system can really help.

104
00:06:06.436 --> 00:06:11.872
Also on the side of scale, there's
the idea of whatever it is that you offer.

105
00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:15.306
So your products or your channels,
of course the number of

106
00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.754
products is important, but
also the number of channels.

107
00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:21.323
So if you've got a single
e-commerce website,

108
00:06:21.323 --> 00:06:23.900
a system is not gonna make a huge impact,
right?

109
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.161
If you just have one site,
that's your main thing.

110
00:06:26.161 --> 00:06:30.510
But if you have multiple digital
products across web, across native,

111
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.742
across other digital touchpoints, then a
system can really help in that situation.

112
00:06:35.742 --> 00:06:39.925
So that's the scale side
of this decision factor.

113
00:06:39.925 --> 00:06:42.092
And the other side is longevity and

114
00:06:42.092 --> 00:06:45.611
this side is a little bit more
about limiting your risk.

115
00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:46.912
[LAUGH] So if you have to,

116
00:06:46.912 --> 00:06:50.949
you have to really think about considering
the stability of the market and

117
00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.958
the stability of the product
that you're working on.

118
00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.825
And that's because design systems
are require a huge investment.

119
00:06:57.825 --> 00:07:02.635
So, if you're gonna spend all this time
and money on a thing, you wanna make

120
00:07:02.635 --> 00:07:07.465
sure that that product that market is
stable beyond at least a year, right?

121
00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:12.469
It takes oftentimes a year or more for you
to start to realize the value of a system.

122
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:15.652
So these things are are expensive.

123
00:07:15.652 --> 00:07:20.860
The investment's high and it takes time
for you to recoup that investment.

124
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.622
This is why I talk about this
as limiting risk, right?

125
00:07:23.622 --> 00:07:26.597
If your product is gonna
go away in a year,

126
00:07:26.597 --> 00:07:30.935
it's probably not the one to
start your design system with.

127
00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:33.733
Of course, if the product and
market are stable,

128
00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:37.739
this can be a really good way to get
more efficiency out of your process.

129
00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:41.907
Or another model is where you have
some really stable products but

130
00:07:41.907 --> 00:07:44.499
you wanna experiment with other ideas.

131
00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:47.732
And so you can use the stability
of a set of your products

132
00:07:47.732 --> 00:07:50.695
to kinda be the guinea pig for
your design system.

133
00:07:50.695 --> 00:07:52.375
And that gives you then,

134
00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:57.419
the ability to use that system to
prototype new ideas in a really rapid way.

135
00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:02.086
In general, I kinda feel like having
one of these on your side is enough to

136
00:08:02.086 --> 00:08:03.858
really consider a system.

137
00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:07.302
But if you've got two, it makes
a much more compelling case, right?

138
00:08:07.302 --> 00:08:10.548
So if you've got a very stable product,
but

139
00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:14.509
you've got a really high
complexity organization.

140
00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:17.770
That's probably enough for
you to really think about doing a system.

141
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.969
If you don't have any of this,

142
00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:21.058
I would probably say maybe
don't worry about it yet.

143
00:08:21.058 --> 00:08:23.428
[LAUGH] But if you've got all three,

144
00:08:23.428 --> 00:08:28.180
that's definitely a scenario where
a system can make a huge, impact.
