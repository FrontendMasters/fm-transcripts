WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.499
And with that, we have an opportunity to
kinda break and have a quick discussion.

2
00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:07.721
So any thoughts or
questions on this initially?

3
00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:10.036
&gt;&gt; In my experience,

4
00:00:10.036 --> 00:00:14.000
that anatomy is an ideal-
&gt;&gt; That's right.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.775
&gt;&gt; Use case, right?

6
00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:15.689
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

7
00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.682
&gt;&gt; However, I've never worked on a design
system that had the opportunity to

8
00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:23.940
really properly layer and
build upon that core.

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.137
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What are your thoughts regarding that?

10
00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:31.987
For example, we're still working
on figuring out a tokens

11
00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:36.647
processing strategy,
which is clearly foundational.

12
00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:40.225
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; How do you continue to build up when

13
00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:42.906
the foundation is finished?

14
00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:44.808
&gt;&gt; Yes, this is such a good question.

15
00:00:44.808 --> 00:00:47.744
I feel like design system work
is notorious for this, right?

16
00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:51.077
It's like we're trying to
change the oil in our car while

17
00:00:51.077 --> 00:00:53.031
we're driving it down the road.

18
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:56.142
[LAUGH] It just feels
like you can never stop.

19
00:00:56.142 --> 00:01:01.027
And this partly is because I think
the organization is never associating,

20
00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.684
the design system is too far
away from revenue, right?

21
00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:09.184
It's too far away from the money to say
we have to stop, get this right, and

22
00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:10.620
then start it up again.

23
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.054
That's, no company will do that.

24
00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:14.987
You can't stop work on the products,
right?

25
00:01:14.987 --> 00:01:20.071
So, I'm a big fan, we're gonna talk
a little bit more in depth when we get

26
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:25.319
into stage one deep dive, but I'm a big
fan of this concept that I just call,

27
00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.011
in design system work,
just the refactoring build.

28
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:33.221
So, instead of you thinking, in fact,
if that's something I should change with

29
00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:37.675
the way these slides are laid out, because
I'm not telling you start with foundations

30
00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:40.930
and build each layer perfectly,
that's just not realistic.

31
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.474
I am trying to show you kind of the ideal.

32
00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:47.896
In practice what this looks like is we do
the work to understand who is important

33
00:01:47.896 --> 00:01:51.922
for us to serve right away out of
the gate cuz we want influential folks.

34
00:01:51.922 --> 00:01:53.570
So I'm gonna talk about
how to find those people.

35
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.688
And then we want to think about what's
gonna solve the biggest problem for

36
00:01:57.688 --> 00:01:58.691
them right away.

37
00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:01.427
And we want to do something
meaningful out of the gate if we can.

38
00:02:01.427 --> 00:02:06.069
So we're starting with a fairly complex
piece of something in your system,

39
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.894
usually a bigger component.

40
00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:12.726
And what we'll do is we'll talk
a little bit more about discovering

41
00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:14.520
that right first piece.

42
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.411
But from there, it's really about
refactoring that into something, because

43
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:22.375
those pieces that you may see that are out
in products already, they're great.

44
00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:25.931
They may be well-built, but they're
probably not built in a systematic way for

45
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:27.508
all the other products to consume.

46
00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:31.675
So that's the refactoring process, and
that's where then slowly you're putting

47
00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:35.150
these little pieces and parts in,
and it's a constant refactoring.

48
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.435
That's just the only way
that I know to do it.

49
00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:39.733
So you're never building it perfectly.

50
00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:41.378
[LAUGH] It will never be perfect.

51
00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:45.458
But I like to think in the ideal because I
feel like we have to have something we're

52
00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:46.899
reaching towards, right?

53
00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:51.177
And that gives us a really good
decision-making, sort of filter.

54
00:02:51.177 --> 00:02:54.483
It's like okay, if I'm gonna make this
choice, I have to understand the debt this

55
00:02:54.483 --> 00:02:56.716
is gonna give me,
the technical debt or creative debt.

56
00:02:56.716 --> 00:03:01.392
And know this has to be a part of my
backlog later to come back and refactor.

57
00:03:01.392 --> 00:03:04.395
So that's kind of the only way
we are able to do the work.

58
00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:06.868
Does that address your question, okay.

59
00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:07.583
Awesome, thanks.

60
00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:08.296
What's up Mark?

61
00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:11.793
&gt;&gt; In an enterprise team
building a new design system,

62
00:03:11.793 --> 00:03:15.773
what are the biggest mistakes
we should try to be avoiding?

63
00:03:15.773 --> 00:03:19.448
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely
gonna talk a lot about that.

64
00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:23.202
If I was gonna pick one, well,
there's sort of two, and

65
00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:28.602
we'll get into this when we talk about
origin stories, is you can't rely too much

66
00:03:28.602 --> 00:03:34.333
on direction from leadership or too much
on direction from individual contributors.

67
00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:38.175
You have to find a balance, you have
to have support from your executives.

68
00:03:38.175 --> 00:03:42.063
But if that's all you do, you're not
gonna build something that's valuable for

69
00:03:42.063 --> 00:03:43.028
your subscribers.

70
00:03:43.028 --> 00:03:46.124
So then you need to balance that
with input from subscribers,

71
00:03:46.124 --> 00:03:48.932
the folks who are building
products every day, right?

72
00:03:48.932 --> 00:03:51.960
That's how you determine what's valuable,
and

73
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.777
it's a constant balance
of those two things.

74
00:03:54.777 --> 00:03:58.593
So I think the biggest mistake I see
folks do is if they're top-down,

75
00:03:58.593 --> 00:04:03.123
which we'll get into, they get a budget
from a boss, and they're kind of beholden

76
00:04:03.123 --> 00:04:06.448
to that boss to do what that boss
thinks they should be doing.

77
00:04:06.448 --> 00:04:09.628
And that's one big mistake,
they're gonna have struggle.

78
00:04:09.628 --> 00:04:11.865
They're gonna struggle with
adoption until they change that.

79
00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:13.895
I guarantee it, I've seen it 1000 times.

80
00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:15.252
The other side of that is,

81
00:04:15.252 --> 00:04:19.653
it's the grassroots model where all I do
is build something that's valuable to me.

82
00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:23.688
And I'm not branching out and thinking
about all the other disciplines that

83
00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:27.533
are also doing this work and reaching
out to stakeholders to get long term

84
00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:31.145
investments so this thing can
actually last and have a real impact.

85
00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:35.838
So those two things are probably the most
common in the early days that I see.

86
00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:39.442
That's more of a perspective than
it is like a coding error, right?

87
00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:42.452
[LAUGH] Other questions?

88
00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:46.955
&gt;&gt; Just another comment,
the cost of miscommunication is incredibly

89
00:04:46.955 --> 00:04:51.541
under-observed, I'm excited to
hear more about that discussed.

90
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.873
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's unbelievable.

91
00:04:53.873 --> 00:04:58.374
I mean, I can't tell you how many times
I have come out of those meetings

92
00:04:58.374 --> 00:05:02.365
just feeling so frustrated that
we misunderstood each other.

93
00:05:02.365 --> 00:05:06.340
And I hate that, especially
because I'm a bit of an idealist,

94
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.446
as you can tell already, right?

95
00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:11.630
That's this whole day is
gonna be about the ideal.

96
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.589
But this work has so much potential to
create unity inside of our organizations.

97
00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:19.642
That's what I really love about it, right?

98
00:05:19.642 --> 00:05:23.517
We're putting everybody on the same team
instead of seeing designers and developers

99
00:05:23.517 --> 00:05:27.039
competing or IT and communications or
however you're structured, right?

100
00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.253
I've been in those meetings where
the air is so thick you could cut it,

101
00:05:31.253 --> 00:05:32.978
I mean it's tense, right?

102
00:05:32.978 --> 00:05:36.326
And that's not how it should be,
we're all trying to serve our clients,

103
00:05:36.326 --> 00:05:38.378
we should be doing that
well with each other.

104
00:05:38.378 --> 00:05:43.051
And I feel like you can kind of
unify around building an internal

105
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:47.294
thing that really does help
you do that better together.

106
00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:48.730
That's what I love about systems.

107
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.256
So that is, I think,
the most powerful thing.

108
00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:52.054
I think you had a question?

109
00:05:52.054 --> 00:05:52.589
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

110
00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:53.111
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

111
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:57.297
&gt;&gt; Have you ever worked with teams who
say they know they don't prioritize

112
00:05:57.297 --> 00:06:01.063
a homegrown design system, so
they're using something like,

113
00:06:01.063 --> 00:06:03.590
say, material design as their baseline.

114
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.381
And what are the big tips you
would give for that approach?

115
00:06:07.381 --> 00:06:11.932
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've helped a lot of
organizations make a decision in that

116
00:06:11.932 --> 00:06:12.853
direction.

117
00:06:12.853 --> 00:06:17.176
And usually, so we're gonna have a whole
section at the very end on culture, and

118
00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:20.241
I think actually,
that's probably the most relevant.

119
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:24.672
That's the most common factor that I can
see in terms of why an organization might

120
00:06:24.672 --> 00:06:26.903
choose to use something like material.

121
00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:30.034
I have nothing against material,
I think it's brilliant.

122
00:06:30.034 --> 00:06:31.535
I just think in some cases,

123
00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:34.876
it's probably not gonna serve
every need you have, right?

124
00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:39.502
So the more mature the systems get that
have chosen to start with something like

125
00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:42.109
that, the more friction they feel with it.

126
00:06:42.109 --> 00:06:47.066
So it usually works really well early on,
and it helps them make really rapid

127
00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:51.481
progress in those early stages,
but there's always a moment where

128
00:06:51.481 --> 00:06:56.369
they realize it's just not gonna do
what they need it to do for their brand.

129
00:06:56.369 --> 00:07:00.695
And so that's where the bigger
refactor kinda comes in.

130
00:07:00.695 --> 00:07:04.828
It's technical debt that you're assuming,
and you know you'll have to pay for

131
00:07:04.828 --> 00:07:06.545
that at some point in the future.

132
00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:08.523
Now I don't wanna misspeak, right?

133
00:07:08.523 --> 00:07:12.177
I'm sure there are design systems
out there that are using it well and

134
00:07:12.177 --> 00:07:16.599
feel like it's everything they need, but
culturally, this is where it comes in.

135
00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:18.938
It's kinda like what's
important to the organization?

136
00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:23.748
If it's speed, if it's competitiveness,
then probably doing something like that

137
00:07:23.748 --> 00:07:27.511
just to be fast and quick to market
is probably maybe a good choice.

138
00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:30.678
But if it's about collaboration,
if it's about our team, so

139
00:07:30.678 --> 00:07:34.889
we'll walk through the different types
of cultures, that's a different model.

140
00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:38.456
And those teams are the ones that probably
will struggle using something that's like

141
00:07:38.456 --> 00:07:40.199
a third party out-of-the-box thing.

142
00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:46.574
&gt;&gt; Do you see differences in approaches,
say, for a B2B app versus a B2C app?

143
00:07:46.574 --> 00:07:48.828
&gt;&gt; I've tried to look for that, and

144
00:07:48.828 --> 00:07:53.910
I haven't really seen a lot of that in
terms of the design system approach.

145
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.325
So, I wish I had that data for you,
but I really just don't, I mean,

146
00:07:58.325 --> 00:08:00.319
we're building interfaces.

147
00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:05.110
So a lot of times, whether it's
individuals that a company using it or

148
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.185
individual consumers using it
is just not that different.

149
00:08:09.185 --> 00:08:10.698
So I haven't seen a lot of that.
