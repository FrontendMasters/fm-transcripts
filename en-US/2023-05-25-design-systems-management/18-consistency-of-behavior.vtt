1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.936
The last stage, I mean, in the maturity
is Stage 4, Evolving a Healthy Program.

2
00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:09.626
And the shift from stage 3 to
stage 4 is also a mindset shift.

3
00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:12.478
We talked a little bit about
that as we went from 2 to 3.

4
00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:16.206
That was the mindset shift of
the design system team, right?

5
00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:18.413
We're no longer only focused on adoption.

6
00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:21.539
Now, we're thinking about all
these other challenges we have.

7
00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.289
Well, Stage 4 is when the organization
as a whole has that mindset shift.

8
00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.269
You've moved from being just another
product or just another tool to becoming

9
00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.523
an influential leader
inside that organization.

10
00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:41.376
And really, what's cool is that all the
stuff that you've been doing in Stage 3,

11
00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:45.439
Stage 2 and Stage 1 is the exact
same stuff you have to do.

12
00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:52.868
To earn that spot in Stage 4, and it's
really about consistency of that behavior.

13
00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:55.706
When you find yourself in
the meeting where the talk,

14
00:00:55.706 --> 00:01:00.390
where there's talk about finding a common
tech stack across all the products, right?

15
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.746
That's probably in Stage 4 because
you've demonstrated it's possible for

16
00:01:04.746 --> 00:01:07.389
us to actually do this in
a really a healthy way.

17
00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:11.085
We could build a system that could support
that single tech stack across all our

18
00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:12.989
organization across all our products.

19
00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.986
Or when you're consulted by the brand
team instead of informed by the brand

20
00:01:16.986 --> 00:01:17.816
team, right?

21
00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:19.397
When they come to you and say hey you,

22
00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:22.529
you know what, we're thinking about
making some changes to the brand.

23
00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:26.477
How would that impact all of these digital
touch points that we have out there?

24
00:01:26.477 --> 00:01:30.317
That's a conversation instead of them
just saying to you this is changing,

25
00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:31.157
make it happen.

26
00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:35.242
Right, so that's a different
that's a different perspective

27
00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:38.276
the organization is
taking toward the system.

28
00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:42.757
Or when the way that people inside your
organization talk about the system,

29
00:01:42.757 --> 00:01:45.501
as if it's elevated to
that place of respect.

30
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:51.228
You've probably that's another scenario
where you just have reached that Stage 4,

31
00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:56.576
and that consistent behavior means
the system is trustworthy and predictable.

32
00:01:56.576 --> 00:02:01.226
And there is not a single organization
on this planet that doesn't want

33
00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:03.872
operational predictability, right?

34
00:02:03.872 --> 00:02:08.892
If you can show that the system creates
predictability in the operations,

35
00:02:08.892 --> 00:02:13.523
that means there's almost no risk for
them to invest in you, right?

36
00:02:13.523 --> 00:02:14.619
That's a huge deal.

37
00:02:16.078 --> 00:02:19.438
That means the design system,
in fact, is more than just a tool.

38
00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:23.169
It is now the key to the organization
operating more efficiently,

39
00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:24.310
operating better.

40
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.890
I remember really vividly a conversation
that I had with a subscriber inside

41
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.743
an organization with a Stage 4 system and
here's a quote from that interview.

42
00:02:35.743 --> 00:02:40.017
He said, I have no hesitation in saying
the people working on the design system

43
00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:41.457
and he listed a few names.

44
00:02:41.457 --> 00:02:43.317
Are the smartest people in our company.

45
00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:44.648
They mentor the other teams,

46
00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:47.214
they're available to help us
tackle really hard stuff.

47
00:02:47.214 --> 00:02:51.344
They are just helpful, respectful,
and really capable people.

48
00:02:51.344 --> 00:02:52.662
And I love that.

49
00:02:52.662 --> 00:02:57.231
That kind of illustrates what you're
looking for, not just those people, but

50
00:02:57.231 --> 00:02:59.287
the system team as a whole, right?

51
00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:04.705
And when I try to kind
of identify what is it?

52
00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:08.785
What's the characteristic from
the outside looking in at a team that

53
00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:11.326
really indicates that they're Stage 4.

54
00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:16.184
It's this kind of proactivity
that I see them with, right?

55
00:03:16.184 --> 00:03:20.560
And I think it's because others
are starting to look to them as leaders,

56
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.940
they start to take that on themselves.

57
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.661
And that means they're coming at
the problems ahead of them instead of

58
00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:29.132
responding instead of
reacting to problems.

59
00:03:29.132 --> 00:03:32.306
So early on in your system,
you're engaging with people and

60
00:03:32.306 --> 00:03:36.675
you're a lot of times, you're just shaping
the system to meet the needs of folks.

61
00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.316
But that's a very reactive stance, right?

62
00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:42.642
Instead, Stage 4 systems are proactive.

63
00:03:42.642 --> 00:03:46.599
They are constantly out there
understanding what's happening in

64
00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.928
the industry,
as things shift they're aware of that.

65
00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:54.218
A Stage 4 design system team sees that
change coming, and maybe they spike out

66
00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:58.510
whether or not we can support that new
version of you or whatever it is, right?

67
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.551
And they are demonstrating how
the system can support those shifts that

68
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:09.443
are coming by the industry, and how the
system isn't able for that kind of growth.

69
00:04:09.443 --> 00:04:12.446
They also help their subscribers
stay on top of what's coming.

70
00:04:12.446 --> 00:04:16.411
They're sometimes aware of what's
going on throughout the organization,

71
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:19.219
because they interact with so
many different groups.

72
00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:20.379
They're way beyond.

73
00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:24.463
They have this organizational intelligence
that other product teams don't have,

74
00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:26.944
because oftentimes
the product teams are siloed.

75
00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:29.039
They don't talk to each other
as much as they should.

76
00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.928
The system team becomes that place
of unity for the conversations.

77
00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:36.977
So in this proactive system team,

78
00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:41.420
they're actually facilitating the maturity
of the organization as a whole.

79
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.950
I mentioned this briefly earlier, but
there's this idea, I'm not quite sure how

80
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.780
to talk about this yet, but
the idea of like codifying that maturity.

81
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.279
Cuz I think I have seen a few scenarios
where maybe two or three interviews

82
00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.853
I've done with different design systems
that I thought were in Stage 4,

83
00:04:58.853 --> 00:05:00.507
like solidly in Stage 4.

84
00:05:00.507 --> 00:05:04.380
And what happened is they lost a couple
folks from their design system team and

85
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.657
very quickly fell back
almost into Stage 2.

86
00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:11.346
And it's because those
individuals were the ones making

87
00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:14.086
the system sort of really solid.

88
00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:18.098
There was too much dependence on
individuals in those scenarios, and

89
00:05:18.098 --> 00:05:19.526
it was working, right?

90
00:05:19.526 --> 00:05:23.697
So, they didn't see a need to make
a change, but all along what we have to do

91
00:05:23.697 --> 00:05:26.826
is try to like embed this
goodness in the system itself.

92
00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:31.211
So, if somebody has a set of processes
they use independently that are not part

93
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:35.609
of the system, they may do great work and
you might see really rapid maturity.

94
00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:39.036
But until those things are codified and
included in the system and

95
00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:42.845
become the way that we work, those
things go away when that person does.

96
00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:47.315
So that's the big risk I see for Stage 4
teams, is when they're too dependent on

97
00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:49.968
a personality or
a superstar or an individual.

98
00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:54.340
So the way that you codify this stuff,
the way that you actually make an impact

99
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.713
in your organization,
is through stability and culture.
