1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.918
So, let's dive a little
deeper into stage one.

2
00:00:02.918 --> 00:00:06.503
I've really been sort of very high
level with it so far and basically all

3
00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:10.584
I've told you is it's just all the stuff
you're doing up to your first release.

4
00:00:10.584 --> 00:00:14.785
So, I actually think the focus for
your stage one is really simple and

5
00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:17.682
I've used this phrase
a few times with you, but

6
00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:21.033
I like this idea of discovering
the right version one.

7
00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:24.109
If you're in the business of
software you know this, right?

8
00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.096
It's really risky.

9
00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:30.079
The biggest risk in software is that
you've just built the wrong thing.

10
00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.227
[LAUGH] So, you do that and you've
spent so much money moving down a path,

11
00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:36.064
now you have gotta to come back.

12
00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:39.297
You've gotta rediscover,
it's expensive, right?

13
00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:40.480
It's a lot of risks.

14
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.799
And I think that's actually
true in design system work to.

15
00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:46.999
What's funny about it is
most people that I talk to,

16
00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:51.457
they just start by building a button,
they start even building colors.

17
00:00:51.457 --> 00:00:55.427
They don't think about how to start,
they just start.

18
00:00:55.427 --> 00:01:00.404
And so,
I think this is where everything begins.

19
00:01:00.404 --> 00:01:03.365
This is where you get to model
that you're gonna be a part

20
00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:06.464
of the organization that
engages with your subscribers.

21
00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:09.292
And so
your challenge here is balancing that,

22
00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:13.796
we gotta release something quickly and
we gotta show some value, right.

23
00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:17.450
We want to try to make this happen fairly
quickly and we want to make sure that

24
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.003
the things that we choose to build
are going to show value out of the gate.

25
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:24.019
The way you succeed with that
is you shape the project, right?

26
00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:26.502
You shape your early system approach,

27
00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:29.746
to show value to the right
potential subscribers.

28
00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:34.106
And I want to talk first a little bit
about how to do that because I think you

29
00:01:34.106 --> 00:01:36.194
have to start with your audience.

30
00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:40.178
So this is a little bit controversial,
I think, this this approach, but

31
00:01:40.178 --> 00:01:43.644
I'm okay with it and I would just say,
do it on a piece of paper and

32
00:01:43.644 --> 00:01:45.273
then throw it away at the end.

33
00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:50.328
[LAUGH] I like to think about
categorizing potential stakeholders or

34
00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:52.287
subscribers in this way.

35
00:01:52.287 --> 00:01:53.875
So you wanna look around and

36
00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:58.236
you wanna see who has influence inside
the organization and who doesn't.

37
00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:02.394
And then once you understand that, you're
gonna actually try to do the work to

38
00:02:02.394 --> 00:02:05.548
understand who's with me in
this approach and who's not.

39
00:02:05.548 --> 00:02:09.738
Who's an advocate for the system work,
for the approach of a design system, and

40
00:02:09.738 --> 00:02:13.261
who's on the really extreme side,
a potential saboteur, right?

41
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:16.781
Who's gonna do everything
they can to make this fail?

42
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:18.901
And as you start talking to folks,

43
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:23.228
you kinda just generally sort of
put them in these quadrants, right?

44
00:02:23.228 --> 00:02:25.011
So you can start to think, you know what?

45
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:28.995
That VP of engineering
was really against this.

46
00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:32.867
He feels like or she feels like we've
got all the systems in place we need.

47
00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:36.005
They've got a lot of influence, but
they're also really not a part of this,

48
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:37.130
they're not an advocate.

49
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.117
So I've put them in that top left,
high influence, potential saboteur, right?

50
00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:46.257
And once you've done this,
you can start to really easily see,

51
00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:49.718
I wanna start with the folks
who have some influence.

52
00:02:49.718 --> 00:02:52.165
So I'm gonna look at
the top of this chart.

53
00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:55.896
And then, it's it's funny
cuz I think human nature is,

54
00:02:55.896 --> 00:02:58.627
let's just avoid the conflict, right?

55
00:02:58.627 --> 00:03:01.275
I'm gonna focus in on my
advocates that have influence and

56
00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:05.182
we're gonna sit around the table and sing
Kumbaya, we're gonna get this work done.

57
00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:10.398
The problem is the real value here is
actually in that top left quadrant.

58
00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:15.322
If you can build some relationships with
folks who don't understand the value yet,

59
00:03:15.322 --> 00:03:19.779
but who also have influence, that's
really where you should be focusing.

60
00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:24.685
Cuz if you can just take one of these
folks and move them into that top right

61
00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:29.675
quadrant, you're really gonna protect
yourself from a lot of the risk,

62
00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:31.543
right of this not working.

63
00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:34.390
So the way you do this is you
sit down with those folks,

64
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.951
you understand their goals, you understand
their frustrations, and you go back and

65
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.390
you try to tell that story of
the system solving those problems.

66
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.054
It's sometimes hard, right?

67
00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:46.201
Cuz these conversations can be tense, and

68
00:03:46.201 --> 00:03:48.949
sometimes they just don't
even want to meet with you.

69
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.170
But there's kind of a little bit of
a trick that I use in those meetings I'll

70
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.778
ask them.

71
00:03:53.778 --> 00:03:57.588
This is an old kind of sales
tactic that if you're in sales or

72
00:03:57.588 --> 00:04:01.032
if you've ever been in sales,
people will use this.

73
00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:04.598
You just try to say something like
there's some question kinda like this.

74
00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:06.986
Imagine that it's a year from today, and

75
00:04:06.986 --> 00:04:10.670
this new design system is live your
team is using it and loves it so

76
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.165
much that you just wanted to take
me to lunch to say thank you.

77
00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:16.721
Just describe for me that future state.

78
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:17.577
How did we get there?

79
00:04:17.577 --> 00:04:18.592
What is that moment like?

80
00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.795
What is the system doing for you, right?

81
00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:26.999
This takes away all the sorta day to day
grind of all the reasons the politics and

82
00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:32.828
it just helps them and you kinda to
imagine that future successful state.

83
00:04:32.828 --> 00:04:37.205
I love this because you will get from
them if they're willing to participate,

84
00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:37.880
all right?

85
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.929
And they probably won't all be but
the ones that will,

86
00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:43.912
you'll get from them what it
is that you actually need

87
00:04:43.912 --> 00:04:47.051
the system to do in order for
them to become an advocate.

88
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:51.147
So, now you know, now you can make
a choice is that the direction the system

89
00:04:51.147 --> 00:04:52.590
should go or not, right?

90
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.700
And you can do the evaluation on how
much time will it take to sort of meet

91
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.347
those needs.

92
00:04:56.347 --> 00:04:57.793
This is really powerful, right?

93
00:04:57.793 --> 00:04:58.996
This will change.

94
00:04:58.996 --> 00:05:01.829
If you can do this,
tell that story in an effective way.

95
00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:05.205
You're moving folks who
are potentially gonna stop the work

96
00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:07.864
into people who want
the work to be successful.

97
00:05:07.864 --> 00:05:12.569
That's probably the biggest way that I
would recommend you're looking to in terms

98
00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.336
of figuring out what that
first thing should be.

99
00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:19.816
You also have to do the work to kind
of define your subscriber groups.

100
00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:24.997
So, this is like the beginning of
you being able to at some point in

101
00:05:24.997 --> 00:05:30.105
the future track adoption in
an actual valuable, nuanced way.

102
00:05:30.105 --> 00:05:33.862
In order to do that you first have to
understand who are the groups of folks

103
00:05:33.862 --> 00:05:35.163
that could use a system.

104
00:05:35.163 --> 00:05:39.636
Now, this is highly dependent on how
your organization is structured.

105
00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:43.705
So, I'll give you three specific examples
of how you could approach it, but

106
00:05:43.705 --> 00:05:47.712
you'll have to kinda make the connection
to the way your titles and teams and

107
00:05:47.712 --> 00:05:48.541
all that work.

108
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:54.161
So, one approach is product or
feature driven subscriber groups.

109
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:58.224
So you might have a group 1,
which is e-commerce web.

110
00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:00.389
So this is the product,
the e-commerce web product.

111
00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.402
So anybody who does anything
on this product is a group.

112
00:06:04.402 --> 00:06:08.690
Maybe the iOS shopping app
is another group that you

113
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.587
are gonna attempt to
support as a subscriber.

114
00:06:12.587 --> 00:06:15.173
Or maybe the checkout flow.

115
00:06:15.173 --> 00:06:18.128
So, this is like a feature of
a specific product, right?

116
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:21.212
The people who are focused on
the checkout flow for E-com,

117
00:06:21.212 --> 00:06:22.883
that's one subscriber group.

118
00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:26.400
So, you can break your subscriber
groups down in this way, product or

119
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.303
feature driven.

120
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:33.362
Another way to break them down is
discipline-driven groups, right?

121
00:06:33.362 --> 00:06:34.369
So, this is simple.

122
00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:39.122
You might say all of the UI
designers are one subscriber group.

123
00:06:39.122 --> 00:06:42.386
All of the UI developers
are another subscriber group.

124
00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:47.289
All of the product owners, all of the UX
researchers, all the content, you name

125
00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:52.198
all the different disciplines that are
involved in getting interfaces designed

126
00:06:52.198 --> 00:06:56.743
and built and into production, each
one of those could be in this example,

127
00:06:56.743 --> 00:06:58.938
a type of subscriber group for you.

128
00:06:58.938 --> 00:07:01.137
So, that the first one is product or
feature driven.

129
00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:03.169
This one is discipline driven.

130
00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.529
And then the third is actually
a combination of those.

131
00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:09.928
So that's where you're thinking
about discipline by product or

132
00:07:09.928 --> 00:07:11.233
discipline by feature.

133
00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:15.394
And some examples, there might be
all of the UI designers that work on

134
00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:17.777
the E-commerce web product, right?

135
00:07:17.777 --> 00:07:22.113
All of the UI devs that are working
in checkout flow of the E-com web.

136
00:07:22.113 --> 00:07:26.825
So, now what you've gotta do is make your
decision on how you want to classify

137
00:07:26.825 --> 00:07:27.777
these groups.

138
00:07:27.777 --> 00:07:30.702
And then just make a list of those groups,
right, and

139
00:07:30.702 --> 00:07:32.722
where they sit in the organization.

140
00:07:32.722 --> 00:07:37.595
In stage one, I spent a lot of time
looking at org charts [LAUGH] that's just

141
00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:42.705
a weird part of this work but because
the system touches all of these different

142
00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:47.580
pieces and parts throughout the
organization, you really do have to have

143
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.637
a good understanding of who sits where and
who reports to who and all of that.

144
00:07:52.637 --> 00:07:56.229
So you're gonna spend some time
looking at the org chart [LAUGH] and

145
00:07:56.229 --> 00:08:00.813
you'll make your own list of here's how
we think about the groups of subscribers.

146
00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:05.714
Once you've done that, you can then do
the work to understand how those groups

147
00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:07.805
track their own metrics, okay?

148
00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:12.525
This is really important, again, for when
you go to try to measure this stuff later.

149
00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:17.549
If you haven't done this, they all
have their own ways of measurements.

150
00:08:17.549 --> 00:08:21.465
They all have their own KPIs or their own
goals that their boss is having them meet.

151
00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:25.129
So, what you need to do is do the work
to understand how they're tracking

152
00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:25.800
that stuff.

153
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.823
It's not your job, actually,
as a design system team to

154
00:08:30.823 --> 00:08:36.171
track the velocity or
efficiency of a product team, right?

155
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:40.541
Hopefully you can correlate as teams
begin using the system that that metric

156
00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:43.614
improves, but
those teams should be responsible for

157
00:08:43.614 --> 00:08:45.607
measuring their own efficiency.

158
00:08:45.607 --> 00:08:47.949
So, you need to understand
how they do that.

159
00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:51.806
And then you need to have them, or
you need to get access to that data, and

160
00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:54.613
you need to start capturing
baselines in stage one.

161
00:08:54.613 --> 00:08:58.344
Cuz if you can't show how fast, in this
case speed, how fast we used to be,

162
00:08:58.344 --> 00:09:01.927
you're not gonna be able to show
the improvement we've made, right?

163
00:09:01.927 --> 00:09:04.134
So you've gotta capture those baselines.

164
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.952
So, this is sort of the beginnings of you
getting to understand how we can actually

165
00:09:10.952 --> 00:09:13.502
at some point in the future
track this stuff.

166
00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:18.374
Now, I keep using this word discover, so
let's talk a little bit more about that.

167
00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:22.890
Now, we've done the work to sorta
define our subscriber groups.

168
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.984
So, I just have sort of some
generic concepts down here brands

169
00:09:25.984 --> 00:09:29.981
products division, however you have
categorized your subscribers, right?

170
00:09:29.981 --> 00:09:33.097
We're gonna plot those out
along the x axis here.

171
00:09:33.097 --> 00:09:35.850
And however you categorize
your scope in this case,

172
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.979
I'm using that definition
the anatomy of a design system,

173
00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:42.923
from the very first section today,
to say we've got foundational stuff,

174
00:09:42.923 --> 00:09:47.136
we've got tokens, we've got core systems,
we've got components, right?

175
00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:50.948
So, there's assets, documentation and
processes for each of those four layers.

176
00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:54.484
So, that's sort of in general
the scope of a system.

177
00:09:54.484 --> 00:10:00.623
And so what I like to do is take a look
at all of the different potential

178
00:10:00.623 --> 00:10:07.875
systematic approaches that it already
exists within your subscriber groups.

179
00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:11.191
So, I met this woman once I was just
literally looking on LinkedIn for

180
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:13.591
people who do design system
work in the research,

181
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:16.646
I've just done a lot of reaching out,
getting to know people.

182
00:10:16.646 --> 00:10:21.508
And I came across this woman who's
title was, design system archaeologist.

183
00:10:21.508 --> 00:10:24.023
And I was like, what the heck is that?

184
00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:27.160
So, I just messaged her,
and we did a call, and

185
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.443
she told me her job, which I love.

186
00:10:29.443 --> 00:10:32.585
It is basically she
just is responsible for

187
00:10:32.585 --> 00:10:37.388
going through all of the work that
subscriber groups are doing and

188
00:10:37.388 --> 00:10:41.331
looking for
really good systematic nuggets of work.

189
00:10:41.331 --> 00:10:44.106
And you might take the approach of saying,

190
00:10:44.106 --> 00:10:48.206
let's build a color system that works for
everybody, right?

191
00:10:48.206 --> 00:10:51.370
That's a really broad approach.

192
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.665
This woman's job was not to to do this,
right?

193
00:10:53.665 --> 00:10:54.952
She was on the design system team.

194
00:10:54.952 --> 00:10:58.415
This is how you would typically start,
a lot of teams start this way,

195
00:10:58.415 --> 00:11:00.935
they might say I'm gonna
build the color system.

196
00:11:00.935 --> 00:11:03.010
Everybody needs colors, so
let's build a color system.

197
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.173
We'll do some tokens and
we'll make this really useful thing.

198
00:11:06.173 --> 00:11:09.355
But instead, she was out there looking for

199
00:11:09.355 --> 00:11:15.117
specific parts of the organization that
had their own color system, right?

200
00:11:15.117 --> 00:11:18.344
Each of these groups probably
has their own stuff, right?

201
00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:19.971
They've got these vertical flows, right?

202
00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:24.796
I've built my own way to handle
the checkout flow in my subscriber group.

203
00:11:24.796 --> 00:11:27.447
But what we're interested in identifying,

204
00:11:27.447 --> 00:11:31.785
is this little color system that
subscriber group one has built, right?

205
00:11:31.785 --> 00:11:33.286
And that's what this woman's job was.

206
00:11:33.286 --> 00:11:36.952
She was out there digging literally,
and talking to folks and

207
00:11:36.952 --> 00:11:40.278
finding really good approaches
that already existed.

208
00:11:40.278 --> 00:11:42.912
But that just weren't made systematically.

209
00:11:42.912 --> 00:11:48.188
So, then the goal becomes, let's take that
little nugget, and we're gonna make that.

210
00:11:48.188 --> 00:11:50.825
We're gonna expand that
horizontally here to work for

211
00:11:50.825 --> 00:11:53.015
all these other subscriber groups, right?

212
00:11:53.015 --> 00:11:56.901
We're gonna build a color
system that works for everyone.

213
00:11:56.901 --> 00:11:59.523
And we're gonna start with
the work of one group.

214
00:11:59.523 --> 00:12:05.684
What's really cool about this is that
you're building trust with this group.

215
00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:10.580
You're making them very much interested
in becoming an adopter of your system.

216
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.732
By default, they're contributing
to your system, [LAUGH] right?

217
00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:17.049
You're building a relationship you're
getting to showcase their work.

218
00:12:17.049 --> 00:12:22.060
And this becomes a nice model for how you
can discover a good way to move forward.

219
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.810
So when you combine this with
the concepts about influence and

220
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.371
sabotage, that's where you can say, okay,

221
00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:35.689
I know this one exact is not for
this work they have a lot of influence.

222
00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:37.825
I'm gonna go take a look at
everybody underneath them..

223
00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:41.514
Let's find something systematic that
we can use as a nugget to start with.

224
00:12:41.514 --> 00:12:46.068
And all of a sudden you're bringing
them into the conversation with you.

225
00:12:46.068 --> 00:12:49.282
Does this make sense as an approach?

226
00:12:49.282 --> 00:12:53.540
Okay, now, again,
this is the ideal, right?

227
00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.722
It's possible that you gonna look out and
everything is spaghetti code and

228
00:12:56.722 --> 00:12:58.743
terrible or
there is no systematic approach and

229
00:12:58.743 --> 00:13:01.133
maybe that's why you're
brought in at the beginning.

230
00:13:01.133 --> 00:13:02.734
But start with this, right?

231
00:13:02.734 --> 00:13:07.271
Start by looking, cuz what you'll see is
that the work that it takes to go do this

232
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:12.085
digging actually helps you build some
rapport, build some relationships anyway,

233
00:13:12.085 --> 00:13:14.816
and you have to do that work regardless,
yeah.

234
00:13:14.816 --> 00:13:19.148
&gt;&gt; Just curious,
in this circumstance is it better to

235
00:13:19.148 --> 00:13:22.484
try to cater the design system to work?

236
00:13:22.484 --> 00:13:26.839
For everyone, so maybe expanding
upon some of the operating so

237
00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:32.181
that it's a little bit more broadly
adopted, or trying to get the individual

238
00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:36.645
teams to focus in and take what
you built out for that one subset.

239
00:13:36.645 --> 00:13:39.895
And try to make it consistent,
I guess in the reverse order.

240
00:13:39.895 --> 00:13:44.068
&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe this is sort of
the challenge of systems work in general,

241
00:13:44.068 --> 00:13:44.572
right?

242
00:13:44.572 --> 00:13:47.944
It's like, how custom is this?

243
00:13:47.944 --> 00:13:51.349
Am I asking everybody to change
to work towards the way that

244
00:13:51.349 --> 00:13:52.749
I think it should work?

245
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:56.554
Or am I as a design system team
accommodating more folks with with

246
00:13:56.554 --> 00:13:57.192
the work.

247
00:13:57.192 --> 00:14:00.805
So, everything you're asking
me is culture related.

248
00:14:00.805 --> 00:14:05.035
So, when we get to the culture, I'm wanna
show you specifically how that decision is

249
00:14:05.035 --> 00:14:07.973
actually it's a spectrum of
choices that you have to make,

250
00:14:07.973 --> 00:14:10.384
depending on the culture
of the organisation and

251
00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:13.531
the culture that you're trying
to build in your systems team.

252
00:14:13.531 --> 00:14:21.807
So everything is on the table here, right?

253
00:14:21.807 --> 00:14:24.737
If you're more of
a collaborative organization,

254
00:14:24.737 --> 00:14:29.436
you're probably gonna want to work with
these groups to let them have influence in

255
00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:31.771
how in this case a color system is built.

256
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:36.149
If you're more on the control side,
it's actually part of the culture for

257
00:14:36.149 --> 00:14:39.356
you to say actually top down
this is what we're doing?

258
00:14:39.356 --> 00:14:41.201
You need to come on board, right?

259
00:14:41.201 --> 00:14:45.527
So, obviously you gonna be nice about it
[LAUGH] but those are two okay approaches.

260
00:14:45.527 --> 00:14:47.535
There's nothing wrong
with either of those.

261
00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:51.276
But I can't tell you which one to do
because I don't know the organization well

262
00:14:51.276 --> 00:14:52.934
enough to make a recommendation.

263
00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:56.840
So, you'll get a chance to kind do a high
level assessment of your culture and

264
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.160
that'll actually lead you down
a good path for a decision there.
