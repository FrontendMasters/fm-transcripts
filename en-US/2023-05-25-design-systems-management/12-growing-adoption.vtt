1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.073
You'll remember we just kind of wrapped
up a deep dive on stage one and

2
00:00:04.073 --> 00:00:07.315
thinking about how to discover
the right first scope.

3
00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:12.014
And you'll remember the transition
from stage 1 into stage 2 is actually

4
00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:14.111
the only one that's very clear.

5
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:18.091
Right, so you've essentially
got that first version live.

6
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:21.159
And so now,
your focus shifts to stage 2 thinking,

7
00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:23.892
which is really around
growing the adoption.

8
00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:29.016
So in my experience,
it's actually not a very good approach

9
00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:33.549
to force people to adopt your system,
to require it.

10
00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:37.594
Although I definitely have
seen organizations do this and

11
00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:41.564
occasionally they can kind of
make their way through it.

12
00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:45.867
It's actually really tricky to do that and
to have that adoption last.

13
00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:53.541
So instead, I think it's much better to
make a system that the people want to use.

14
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:58.168
And we've talked kind of a bit about
that throughout the day, but really if

15
00:00:58.168 --> 00:01:02.959
you've done the work to understand
what's important to your subscribers.

16
00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:05.477
Remember that's that engagement piece.

17
00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:09.913
If you've listened to their input,
if you've listened to their feedback and

18
00:01:09.913 --> 00:01:14.082
asked them to participate to help
shape the project, you're gonna build

19
00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:18.411
something that solves their problems and
doesn't make their work harder.

20
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:22.635
And that's kind of the key to making
something they're gonna want to use.

21
00:01:22.635 --> 00:01:26.525
So the top challenge here in stage
2 is to evolve the system to show

22
00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:29.093
value to potential subscribers, right?

23
00:01:29.093 --> 00:01:33.467
You're trying to not only support
the ones who are on board already, but

24
00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:38.273
you're now thinking about who uses the
system, or who could use the system that

25
00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:42.167
doesn't yet and what are the things
that are important to them.

26
00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:46.371
So this means you've gotta be really
strategic about how you approach

27
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.233
the evolution of your system.

28
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.841
And actually the same kind of approach,

29
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:54.984
you kinda remember this approach
that we took early on, right,

30
00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:59.589
where we took that color system for
one specific subscriber group, and

31
00:01:59.589 --> 00:02:03.759
maybe we made that work across
a whole set of subscriber groups.

32
00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.065
Now, if you've followed that same pattern,
you've taken that work and

33
00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:08.878
you've maybe expanded it a little, and

34
00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:12.418
maybe you've found some other areas where
you could do the same kind of thing.

35
00:02:12.418 --> 00:02:16.162
And that maybe was your first release.

36
00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:18.479
So now you're trying to
grow that adoption, right?

37
00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:23.358
You're needing really to kinda push
hard on engagement with those potential

38
00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:28.851
subscriber groups and understand what they
need and keep expanding into other areas.

39
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:32.327
Your goal is to be really
kind of selectively filling

40
00:02:32.327 --> 00:02:34.855
out this area as much as makes sense for

41
00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:39.761
your organization in a way that helps
you organically grow the adoption.

42
00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:43.652
This is kinda how you take the approach
of building a system people want to use.

43
00:02:43.652 --> 00:02:46.279
And if you're really creative,
you can make a lot of progress here.

44
00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:52.069
I remember one story that I had with one
gentleman I was doing an interview with,

45
00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.736
and he was a designer, and
it was kind of a design-led system and

46
00:02:56.736 --> 00:03:01.072
he had gotten the budget to
hire one front-end developer.

47
00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:05.446
And he had done a bunch of work and some
design tools and the front end dev came in

48
00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:10.157
and they actually coded out some really
cool components, HTML only to start with,

49
00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:13.251
web only to start with, and
they were having a hard time

50
00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:16.452
getting devs to really be
interested in using it [LAUGH].

51
00:03:16.452 --> 00:03:21.614
And so he just started kinda showing up to
the open door stuff their dev team had.

52
00:03:21.614 --> 00:03:24.897
He was just sitting and
listening to the conversations and

53
00:03:24.897 --> 00:03:29.252
before every meeting started, he noticed
they were talking about wanting,

54
00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:31.941
the devs really wanting
to do open source work.

55
00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:33.665
And so he heard that in several meetings.

56
00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:35.804
So he went back to his boss and
he was like,

57
00:03:35.804 --> 00:03:38.937
how would you feel about us open
sourcing the design system?

58
00:03:38.937 --> 00:03:43.093
[LAUGH] And his boss was like, sure,
they kinda took a look at it and

59
00:03:43.093 --> 00:03:46.766
made sure there was nothing in
there they couldn't release.

60
00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:51.371
They got a version of it out in open
source, and literally within weeks,

61
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:56.071
he had developers interested in not
just using it but contributing to it.

62
00:03:56.071 --> 00:04:00.122
So that's just a really creative way to
kinda figure out what is it that these

63
00:04:00.122 --> 00:04:00.829
folks want?

64
00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.360
What is it that they actually need?

65
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.274
And how do we come alongside them,
understand those needs, and

66
00:04:07.274 --> 00:04:10.645
evolve the system in
a way that makes sense.

67
00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:14.008
I love that, but
I'll also just say that's not enough.

68
00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:19.624
It's not enough to build a system
that is just what people want,

69
00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:23.888
because you're also asking them to change,
and

70
00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:30.233
changing their workflows does take time,
right, it does take effort.

71
00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:35.192
When I first did this work, one of
the things I thought I would be able

72
00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:40.252
to identify was a percentage threshold
of some measure of adoption.

73
00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:45.080
That means you've got enough people using
the system that you can move on to other

74
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.789
stage three type concerns.

75
00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:52.154
But it turns out some teams move
into stage three very quickly.

76
00:04:52.154 --> 00:04:55.278
And some, they'll get lots of
people using the system, but

77
00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:59.210
they still aren't actually thinking
about anything other than adoption.

78
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.156
And it turns out that the thing that sort
of really actually helps you identify

79
00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:08.645
when that mindset shifts is actually
not what you thought it would be,

80
00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:13.842
it's not some threshold of users or
adopted or subscriber groups or something.

81
00:05:13.842 --> 00:05:17.868
Instead, it's actually thinking
about the level of effort that

82
00:05:17.868 --> 00:05:20.440
it takes to onboard a single subscriber.

83
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.897
And over time, what we see is if I do
the work to make the level of effort for

84
00:05:25.897 --> 00:05:29.834
one subscriber to come on as
a new user to the system,

85
00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:34.847
over time that means I can actually
allow for more users to come on,

86
00:05:34.847 --> 00:05:38.730
and my time is saved because
it's easier for them.

87
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.404
They're more willing to come on
because it's easier for them.

88
00:05:42.404 --> 00:05:45.990
I've also made the job easier for
me and my team.

89
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.554
It's like a weird sort of thing, but this
is actually one of the keys to getting

90
00:05:50.554 --> 00:05:53.748
users to come on board and
stay on board of your system.
