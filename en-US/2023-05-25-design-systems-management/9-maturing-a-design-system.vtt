1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.513
Let's move on.

2
00:00:01.513 --> 00:00:06.289
So we've covered the anatomy, we did a
really high-level overview of the maturity

3
00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:09.395
model, and
we just kind of explained origin stories.

4
00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:14.227
Now what I'd like to do is kinda walk
you through a very simple framework for

5
00:00:14.227 --> 00:00:16.002
how to mature your system.

6
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.349
So in order to mature through
the stages in a healthy way,

7
00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.093
no matter what origin story you have,
there are three areas of focus that you've

8
00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:27.186
always got to be working in,
period, all the time.

9
00:00:27.186 --> 00:00:31.043
And those three are education,
engagement, and evolution,

10
00:00:31.043 --> 00:00:33.382
conveniently all starting with an e.

11
00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:37.121
[LAUGH] So the first one,
education, educate,

12
00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:42.741
this is where it's you,
a one-way interaction, teaching, right?

13
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.592
You're educating folks
throughout the organization.

14
00:00:44.592 --> 00:00:48.654
These could be potential subscribers,
they could be your existing subscribers,

15
00:00:48.654 --> 00:00:50.809
they could be stakeholders, leadership.

16
00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.050
And you're just essentially
teaching them about the system and

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.180
why this is important, right?

18
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.176
When I mentioned those two
consulting engagements from earlier,

19
00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:02.538
this is one of the things
they had both been missing.

20
00:01:02.538 --> 00:01:06.004
They weren't doing the work to
spread around that common language,

21
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:09.542
the common understanding,
the reasons why they were doing the work.

22
00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:11.787
And when you make assumptions
about that stuff,

23
00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:13.986
folks are gonna come up
with their own stories.

24
00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:16.786
So that's really what was
happening in both of those cases.

25
00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:20.188
The other thing you're trying to do
here is really cast a vision for

26
00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:23.668
what the system could be and
what it could do for your organization.

27
00:01:23.668 --> 00:01:27.123
And that's why I think it's
important to have some

28
00:01:27.123 --> 00:01:31.475
time in your day set aside to
the higher level thinking, right?

29
00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:36.461
That 30,000 foot view of what is it we're
actually trying to accomplish here?

30
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:38.914
Where could we go if we
did this really well?

31
00:01:38.914 --> 00:01:42.992
You're responsible for essentially
leading that part of the effort.

32
00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:46.651
You have to cast a vision, nobody else
is gonna do that [LAUGH] for you.

33
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:50.965
So that's a part of this, and
that's all part of these education tasks.

34
00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:52.999
Engagement is a two-way interaction.

35
00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:58.696
This is where you're interacting with the
subscribers in particular, or leadership.

36
00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:00.826
This is where you're learning from them,
right?

37
00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:04.852
So the example I gave a moment ago of
observation is one way you can engage

38
00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:08.695
with them to understand the kind
of problems that they're facing.

39
00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.374
Anything where you're getting feedback,
right?

40
00:02:11.374 --> 00:02:15.167
So if you've got a way for
them to submit bugs or ideas or

41
00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:18.807
that kinda thing,
that's all part of engagement.

42
00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:23.738
Really the goal here is to kinda give them
a say in the way that the system grows,

43
00:02:23.738 --> 00:02:28.404
and that's how you build something
that's actually valuable for them.

44
00:02:28.404 --> 00:02:32.215
And of course, engagement means you're
always looking to recruit folks, right?

45
00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:34.877
You're trying to get them
on the team of the system.

46
00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:38.064
Not maybe necessarily
full-time billing on the team,

47
00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:41.675
but you want them as adopters,
you want them as contributors.

48
00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:45.361
And so in order to do that, they have
to know that there's value in what

49
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:48.621
they can offer you and
you have to communicate that with them.

50
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:51.813
And then evolution is kind of the things
that everybody thinks of when

51
00:02:51.813 --> 00:02:53.363
they're doing a design system.

52
00:02:53.363 --> 00:02:55.748
They think I need to go build this,
I need to go design this.

53
00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:59.321
So it's a team effort, it's iterative,
you're making the system better.

54
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:02.349
Anything you're doing in terms of design,
where you're

55
00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.565
actually creating components or
development, where you're building those.

56
00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:10.947
Or user experience, maybe where you're
testing and iterating on those,

57
00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:12.693
all of those things, right?

58
00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:17.517
And remember not just the assets, but
your documentation and your processes,

59
00:03:17.517 --> 00:03:20.548
all of that is part of
evolving the design system.

60
00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:25.261
One of the most common problems that I
see in folks when we're doing sort of

61
00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:27.325
these assessments of a system.

62
00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:30.032
When somebody feels like
they're kinda getting stuck and

63
00:03:30.032 --> 00:03:32.794
they can't break through into
another stage of maturity,

64
00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:36.404
most often it's because they're focused
on only one or two of these things.

65
00:03:36.404 --> 00:03:40.562
And they haven't done the work to either
educate, or maybe they haven't done

66
00:03:40.562 --> 00:03:44.532
the work to engage, so they're having
a hard time with adoption, right?

67
00:03:44.532 --> 00:03:45.892
For me, it's usually pretty simple.

68
00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:49.378
It's kinda go in,
understand the steps they've taken so far,

69
00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:52.797
do some interviews with subscribers and
the systems team, and

70
00:03:52.797 --> 00:03:55.586
then we can quickly identify,
you know what?

71
00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:57.370
There's a lot of confusion about this.

72
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.656
Or you asked for
people to contribute and they did, but

73
00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:03.026
you didn't use their contributions.

74
00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:04.457
So now they're feeling like,

75
00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:07.326
we didn't have a good process
around contribution, right?

76
00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:11.250
So there's maybe gaps in some
of the things that you've tried.

77
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.720
So what we try to do is help them take
that bigger view, sit back and take a look

78
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.519
at all the things they've done, map out
where those fit into something like this,

79
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.802
and then say, actually, we are missing
this and we're missing this.

80
00:04:21.802 --> 00:04:27.246
Let's show up the foundational pieces so
we can move through this in a healthy way.

81
00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:30.002
Now I wish it was as easy
as just do the education,

82
00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:34.393
do the engagement, do the evolution,
and then you move into the next stage.

83
00:04:34.393 --> 00:04:35.827
But [LAUGH] of course, it's not.

84
00:04:35.827 --> 00:04:38.829
So I tend to think of it
kinda more like this, right?

85
00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:44.501
It's just a cycle of these three things,
and you're just constantly doing these.

86
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:47.716
And after you do that long enough,
you're gonna kinda look up and

87
00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:51.883
realize, we've actually matured in
a really healthy way into the next stage.

88
00:04:51.883 --> 00:04:53.627
So, very simple, right?

89
00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:54.887
If we take this,

90
00:04:54.887 --> 00:05:00.205
we can kinda overlay it on top of
the four stages of maturity like this.

91
00:05:00.205 --> 00:05:04.265
And I draw it like this because
I want you to see that.

92
00:05:04.265 --> 00:05:06.682
I call this an additive framework.

93
00:05:06.682 --> 00:05:11.209
In other words, it's not a set of things
you do in stage 1 that are educational and

94
00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:13.979
then you stop doing those
when you get to stage 2.

95
00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.145
Instead, when you move to stage 2,
you're adding more of those tasks, but

96
00:05:18.145 --> 00:05:21.622
you can never stop being the person
casting the vision, right?

97
00:05:21.622 --> 00:05:25.347
You can never stop educating about
what a system is, why it's important.

98
00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:27.336
Those are just things
that have to be part,

99
00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:29.782
they just always have to be
coming out of your mouth.

100
00:05:29.782 --> 00:05:32.745
[LAUGH] People are gonna get
sick of it and you, as a leader,

101
00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:35.539
are gonna feel like you're
just repeating yourself.

102
00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.961
But the thing is you're talking to
different people all the time, so

103
00:05:38.961 --> 00:05:42.563
you have to push through that kind of
fear of just sounding repetitious.

104
00:05:42.563 --> 00:05:46.923
And the other reason I draw this is
cuz when I have conversations with

105
00:05:46.923 --> 00:05:51.667
executives about budgets, I like to
show them that the volume of work this

106
00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:56.279
team is trying to tackle is growing
a lot as the system matures, right?

107
00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:01.070
The things you have to do in stage 1 just
to get the first version live, well,

108
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.447
it's a smaller team, very focused.

109
00:06:03.447 --> 00:06:07.671
But when you get to stage 2, when you
get to stage 3, you need more people,

110
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:11.578
you need more time, it's almost
impossible to do this without that.

111
00:06:11.578 --> 00:06:15.646
And so this visually tries to
kinda communicate that, hey,

112
00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:18.690
we're expanding the scope
of the work here.

113
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.759
So let's talk about, just quickly,
the way that these three es, education,

114
00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.770
evolution, and engagement, change
through the stages a little bit, okay?

115
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.982
So in stage 1, education tends to be
things like just very simply defining

116
00:06:33.982 --> 00:06:39.875
what systems are, [LAUGH] and doing so in
the context of your specific organization.

117
00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:43.027
So this is not you going out and
looking up someone else's

118
00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:47.638
definition of a design system and then
just putting it in your PowerPoint, right?

119
00:06:47.638 --> 00:06:52.827
This is you actually thinking through how
does this impact us in our context and

120
00:06:52.827 --> 00:06:55.275
communicating about that, right?

121
00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:59.158
Sharing the benefits, sharing
the investment costs, the approach,

122
00:06:59.158 --> 00:07:01.497
casting that vision that we talked about.

123
00:07:01.497 --> 00:07:05.504
Engagement here, and we're gonna spend a
lot more time on this a little later, but

124
00:07:05.504 --> 00:07:08.653
this idea of discovering what will
make your first version really

125
00:07:08.653 --> 00:07:09.699
desirable, right?

126
00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.788
So in stage 1,
you're setting yourself up for

127
00:07:12.788 --> 00:07:16.510
either your adoption success or
your adoption failure.

128
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.253
And what I would recommend is that you
really invest in this engagement activity

129
00:07:21.253 --> 00:07:25.921
stuff in stage 1, because that's kinda
set you up for a really easy stage 2,

130
00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:28.790
if you've built something that's valuable.

131
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.966
Of course, also engagement, you're gonna
be identifying early adopters who might

132
00:07:32.966 --> 00:07:37.144
test, identifying leaders who might be
interested in supporting things like this.

133
00:07:37.144 --> 00:07:41.103
And evolution, it's all the stuff you need
to get that first version live in stage 1,

134
00:07:41.103 --> 00:07:43.382
so you're iterating toward
that first release,

135
00:07:43.382 --> 00:07:45.949
you're sometimes focused
on the fundamental layers.

136
00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:49.965
You're building a doc site often, we
haven't even talked a lot about that, but

137
00:07:49.965 --> 00:07:53.879
most design systems have a documentation
site where these things kinda live.

138
00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:55.835
There's all kinds of great
third-party tools for building those.

139
00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:58.817
A lot of folks build those
from the ground up themselves.

140
00:07:58.817 --> 00:08:02.038
But it's sort of a single place
where all of this lives, and

141
00:08:02.038 --> 00:08:06.435
you kinda link out to all the important
resources and assets and stuff for folks.

142
00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:09.532
And you're writing really good docs here,

143
00:08:09.532 --> 00:08:15.150
especially around how to use the system
and how to come on board as a subscriber.

144
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.834
So that's high level the kinds of things
that you'll be thinking about at stage 1.

145
00:08:18.834 --> 00:08:22.376
Now when you move into stage 2,
you've got that first version live,

146
00:08:22.376 --> 00:08:24.974
you don't stop doing these things,
[LAUGH] right?

147
00:08:24.974 --> 00:08:26.649
You're gonna continue iterating, right?

148
00:08:26.649 --> 00:08:30.875
You're gonna continue building the doc
set, you're gonna continue evolving all

149
00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:34.209
this stuff, but you're also gonna
add to it a bunch of new stuff.

150
00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:38.724
So in stage 2, education grows, right?

151
00:08:38.724 --> 00:08:41.024
Now I didn't have a system to
show in stage 1, now I have one.

152
00:08:41.024 --> 00:08:45.499
So now in terms of education,
I can demo this thing.

153
00:08:45.499 --> 00:08:49.478
I can actually show you how it works,
I can even sit with you,

154
00:08:49.478 --> 00:08:53.237
maybe in the engagement section,
I can help you do that.

155
00:08:53.237 --> 00:08:57.064
We wanna capture these demos and record
those and put them in the doc site and

156
00:08:57.064 --> 00:08:59.921
even transcribe them so
the content is searchable, and

157
00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:03.351
all of that should be part of what
you're thinking about, right?

158
00:09:03.351 --> 00:09:05.629
You wanna share some adoption stories,

159
00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:09.121
I actually recommend that you
tell some really good stories.

160
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:12.404
Here's a couple use cases where
this team really wanted it.

161
00:09:12.404 --> 00:09:14.314
They came on board and
a matter of weeks and

162
00:09:14.314 --> 00:09:17.163
all of a sudden we're seeing
some really good improvements.

163
00:09:17.163 --> 00:09:19.330
And tell some of the horror stories too,
right?

164
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.018
This team tried to use it,
they really struggled, and here's why, and

165
00:09:23.018 --> 00:09:25.144
here's what we did to help them, right?

166
00:09:25.144 --> 00:09:28.062
That's you communicating that
you're a partner to them,

167
00:09:28.062 --> 00:09:31.577
not just that you want the folks to
come on and figure it out themselves.

168
00:09:31.577 --> 00:09:33.634
This is where you now
have probably a roadmap,

169
00:09:33.634 --> 00:09:35.862
you're thinking about
the future of the system.

170
00:09:35.862 --> 00:09:39.029
You're giving those folks a voice
collaborating in the roadmap in

171
00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:39.940
the engaged area.

172
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.567
But you wanna share in terms of
education of what's coming next and

173
00:09:43.567 --> 00:09:45.656
why we've chosen to do those things.

174
00:09:45.656 --> 00:09:49.358
And then we're gonna talk a lot more
about adoption goals and metrics too,

175
00:09:49.358 --> 00:09:53.121
because that's a really tricky,
that's a very nuanced conversation, so

176
00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:56.154
we've got a whole deep dive
section on that in a moment here.

177
00:09:56.154 --> 00:09:59.021
But it's time,
as you develop those things,

178
00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:03.139
you really have to be educating
folks about what it means to adopt,

179
00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:06.757
cuz that's a whole another
conversation of complexity.

180
00:10:06.757 --> 00:10:11.457
Pairing in the engage area, gathering
feedback, collaborating on that roadmap.

181
00:10:11.457 --> 00:10:15.142
Of course, supporting the people who
have already subscribed, and then doing

182
00:10:15.142 --> 00:10:19.114
the work to go up, if you're grassroots,
talk to leaders, get financial support.

183
00:10:19.114 --> 00:10:22.802
Doing the work to move down,
get to know the individual contributors,

184
00:10:22.802 --> 00:10:26.130
understand how you can support
them better if you're top down.

185
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.743
And then evolution, of course, you're
continuing to evolve the system, right?

186
00:10:30.743 --> 00:10:35.256
But specifically, documentation
that really covers how to adopt,

187
00:10:35.256 --> 00:10:37.897
this is one of the ways
you make it easy for

188
00:10:37.897 --> 00:10:42.987
them to come on board as you make it very
clear and very simple for them to do so.

189
00:10:42.987 --> 00:10:47.331
I say strategically adding new
features because in stage 2,

190
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:53.443
oftentimes your team hasn't actually grown
in size, but the scope of work is larger.

191
00:10:53.443 --> 00:10:58.406
So you've gotta be really careful
about where you spend your time here.

192
00:10:58.406 --> 00:11:02.952
I think you've gotta be really specific
about the features you wanna add or

193
00:11:02.952 --> 00:11:07.296
the new components or whatever it is
that you're adding to the system.

194
00:11:07.296 --> 00:11:09.759
And you've gotta make sure that
it's really well documented so

195
00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:11.870
that it's trustworthy,
the quality has to be there.

196
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.201
And again, strategically fixing issues,

197
00:11:15.201 --> 00:11:20.067
there's a lot of prioritization
that has to happen in stage 2.

198
00:11:20.067 --> 00:11:23.744
Stage 3, surviving the teenage years.

199
00:11:23.744 --> 00:11:27.243
Now we actually have
some adoption going on.

200
00:11:27.243 --> 00:11:30.411
So what we can do is, and
we're gonna talk a lot more about this,

201
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:32.819
we're gonna start to
correlate improvements,

202
00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:36.009
the promises we made earlier,
we're gonna be more efficient.

203
00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:38.123
It's very generic, but
we're gonna be more efficient.

204
00:11:38.123 --> 00:11:41.994
So now you can start to correlate the use
of the system with better efficiency in

205
00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:42.706
those teams.

206
00:11:42.706 --> 00:11:49.432
And that's tricky to do, but that's how
you kinda make good on your promises.

207
00:11:49.432 --> 00:11:54.028
We see lots more sophisticated
communication strategies here,

208
00:11:54.028 --> 00:11:58.967
very refined documentation for
how to use the system and how to adopt.

209
00:11:58.967 --> 00:12:01.459
We're starting to see
things like governance and

210
00:12:01.459 --> 00:12:03.012
contribution come into play.

211
00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:07.328
And so we're educating, we're doing
the work to kinda share all of that.

212
00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:12.276
There's this sort of series of processes
that kinda come into play usually in stage

213
00:12:12.276 --> 00:12:16.526
3, ambassador or something like
this is kinda what they're called.

214
00:12:16.526 --> 00:12:21.040
But the idea is just that an individual
who's not dedicated to one team or

215
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.077
the other spends time with one team or
the other.

216
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:28.283
So you may be sending somebody as an
ambassador into a product or feature team,

217
00:12:28.283 --> 00:12:32.171
or they may be sending somebody to kinda
come on board the systems team for

218
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:34.039
a while and spend some time there.

219
00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:36.675
So there's all kinds of different
ways to structure that.

220
00:12:36.675 --> 00:12:39.373
That's a really cool way
to engage with folks,

221
00:12:39.373 --> 00:12:42.618
it's also really disruptive
to all the teams involved.

222
00:12:42.618 --> 00:12:46.071
So it comes with pros and cons and it
kinda depends on what you need in a given

223
00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:49.205
season as to whether I would
recommend you doing that kinda thing.

224
00:12:49.205 --> 00:12:53.388
I see organizations start to
host those folks coming in, but

225
00:12:53.388 --> 00:12:56.845
also to provide really cool onboarding,
right?

226
00:12:56.845 --> 00:13:00.921
This is another way where you can sort
of solidify the value of the system in

227
00:13:00.921 --> 00:13:02.893
different ways is by saying, hey,

228
00:13:02.893 --> 00:13:06.270
all of our product teams
are supposed to be using this thing.

229
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.551
When a new employee starts,
we've developed the whole curriculum for

230
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:11.310
them to learn the system, all right?

231
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.110
So now new employees spend a few
weeks learning the system,

232
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:19.670
they go into your product or feature
teams as real advocates with a solid

233
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.028
understanding of how we do interface work,
right?

234
00:13:23.028 --> 00:13:24.655
So this is powerful stuff.

235
00:13:24.655 --> 00:13:29.339
You're taking the load off of other teams,
you're the right person to be doing that,

236
00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:31.535
you're the right team to be doing that.

237
00:13:31.535 --> 00:13:35.300
So I think there's a lot of value
in that as a potential engagement,

238
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.661
sometimes accepting contributions,
really solidifying that support, and

239
00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:42.647
of course,
continuing to evolve the thing, right?

240
00:13:42.647 --> 00:13:47.173
We start to see a lot more definition
of more complicated processes here,

241
00:13:47.173 --> 00:13:50.025
continuing to add documentation and
assets.

242
00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:53.011
This is where we're seeing teams,
well, okay,

243
00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:57.135
we've done all the things we can do
to support the folks using React,

244
00:13:57.135 --> 00:14:01.065
now we gotta bite the bullet and
get all the Angular stuff in here.

245
00:14:01.065 --> 00:14:04.093
So now we're taking on
that extra work of saying,

246
00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:08.420
we're gonna manage two sets of assets and
two different frameworks for

247
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.837
our dev teams to use, and we're gonna
own keeping those things in sync.

248
00:14:12.837 --> 00:14:15.942
And we're gonna work with those
teams to really figure out how to do

249
00:14:15.942 --> 00:14:17.003
this in a healthy way.

250
00:14:17.003 --> 00:14:20.804
In that case, you might also choose to
scale back a little bit on how much you're

251
00:14:20.804 --> 00:14:21.897
gonna offer, right?

252
00:14:21.897 --> 00:14:24.846
So it's okay to be removing
some of these things,

253
00:14:24.846 --> 00:14:28.302
that's where we start to see
deprecation come into play.

254
00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:32.660
So stage 4, all the things we've
talked about, of course, but

255
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.749
also this is where you're kinda getting
a seat at the bigger table, right?

256
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:42.147
So here it's where you're actively
participating in some bigger picture

257
00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.200
conversations.

258
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.697
These teams are the ones that have their
pulse on what's happening in the industry,

259
00:14:47.697 --> 00:14:50.879
pulse on what's happening
throughout the organization.

260
00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:55.139
And they're explaining the design system's
role in any of these new initiatives that

261
00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:56.082
might come along.

262
00:14:56.082 --> 00:15:00.468
They're actively demonstrating
how the system is making all

263
00:15:00.468 --> 00:15:02.328
the product work better.

264
00:15:02.328 --> 00:15:07.505
They are continuously interacting
with subscriber groups of course,

265
00:15:07.505 --> 00:15:11.741
and they're sitting at the table for
big conversations.

266
00:15:11.741 --> 00:15:16.271
Really, the evolution here is about making
sure that we're actually giving you

267
00:15:16.271 --> 00:15:20.080
the best way to design and
build digital interfaces in our context.

268
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.888
So it's very much a leadership,
it's a really proactive kind of approach,

269
00:15:23.888 --> 00:15:27.188
whereas a lot of the earlier stages
are a little bit more reactive.
