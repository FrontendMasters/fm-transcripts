00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.053
&gt;&gt; The Primeagen: Whenever the last time
I did the developer productivity course,

2
00:00:03.053 --> 00:00:05.953
I did a version of this, but
things have changed a little bit.

3
00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:09.800
And I think I've made it a touch more
robust, found some kind of funny bugs that

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.824
exist within the tmux world, which means
that if you translate this into Zella J,

5
00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:15.657
it's probably a little bit better.

6
00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:18.472
Maybe there's some things you
don't have to worry about.

7
00:00:18.472 --> 00:00:20.184
So if you wish to enjoy some tmux,

8
00:00:20.184 --> 00:00:23.315
you can install it with any of
these various distributions.

9
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:26.684
Now, remember, if you are going to do
that, you might as well make part of your

10
00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:30.160
dot N files, the things we already built,
create your own little tmux installer

11
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.461
script or call it like your dev util
script, something in there to do it all.

12
00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:36.080
And then I also have this to
kind of get up and running.

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.089
This is like a basic config for
tmux that I think is good.

14
00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.546
There's a couple of weird things
about tmux, like one thing,

15
00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:46.995
your first window is in position zero,
which zero is way over here on this pinky.

16
00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:49.868
And then then it starts as one,
two, three, four or five,

17
00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:53.615
which is just kind of weird to have one,
two, three, this just a weird feel.

18
00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:55.117
And so maybe TJ is right.

19
00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:57.581
Maybe we should start at one for
all of our indices.

20
00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.682
Maybe Lua got it right all this time.

21
00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:02.930
Second off, I like Ctrl+A versus Ctrl+B.

22
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.420
You can just leave Ctrl+B
as your prefix key.

23
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.596
We'll talk about that in a moment.

24
00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:10.596
And also, whenever I go into copy mode and

25
00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:14.710
I want to navigate around in my terminal,
I have Vi keys,

26
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.308
meaning that when I'm in here, if I go
here and we can just do a bunch of these.

27
00:01:20.308 --> 00:01:24.355
I can go in here and then navigate
through what I've done so far, and

28
00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:26.777
I go in here and highlight it and yank it.

29
00:01:26.777 --> 00:01:28.507
Now I have that copied.

30
00:01:28.507 --> 00:01:30.942
So I like that experience, right?

31
00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:34.583
So I want to have kind of your basic
Vi keys of being able to do control up,

32
00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:35.386
control down.

33
00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:38.636
These, be able to highlight areas,
navigate around while highlighting and

34
00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:39.838
then yank the things I want.

35
00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:44.810
I find that very nice rather than going,
scrolling up and then finding the one

36
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.875
you want, and then going in there and
copying it, and I didn't even do right.

37
00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.375
And then you get the whole idea,
I don't like that experience.

38
00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:55.972
I just wanna use keys to do it,
because I'm faster on keys.

39
00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:56.907
There we go.

40
00:01:56.907 --> 00:02:00.823
And then, of course, this little nifty
one, I think is pretty clever, which is

41
00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:04.928
that we're going to be kind of changing
our tmux config if you're following along.

42
00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:08.740
So binding out R to refresh your config.

43
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.324
So that way as you're running,
you can just say prefix r and

44
00:02:12.324 --> 00:02:14.128
it will refresh your config.

45
00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:17.532
And then now you're up to date with your
latest version of whatever we're doing.

46
00:02:17.532 --> 00:02:18.279
I kind of like that.

47
00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.399
Makes me feel good.

48
00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:20.917
Makes me happy at least.

49
00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:24.689
So what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna
just do the following, I'm gonna take this

50
00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.750
nice little thing right here and
I'm gonna copy the whole thing and

51
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.761
I'm gonna create a new script right here
and I'm gonna, whoopsie daisies here.

52
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:32.695
Let me just go like this.

53
00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:35.563
I'm gonna go dev end really quickly,
cheat for a quick second,

54
00:02:35.563 --> 00:02:37.377
have my kind of vim experience, right?

55
00:02:37.377 --> 00:02:41.109
And I'm gonna put this in
config I'm gonna create tmux,

56
00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.462
I'm gonna go in here and
I'm gonna go tmux.conf.

57
00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:49.242
Notice that we're actually good, the thing
we've already built, we're using it,

58
00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:50.888
live action, it feels good.

59
00:02:50.888 --> 00:02:53.384
I'm also gonna rename this
to nail them too, just so

60
00:02:53.384 --> 00:02:55.729
I don't own myself every
single time I refresh.

61
00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.898
And so,
that way I can keep my current one.

62
00:02:58.898 --> 00:03:00.240
Yeah, yeah, I think that's fair.

63
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.987
I think that's fair.

64
00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:02.157
Good answer.

65
00:03:02.157 --> 00:03:03.185
Good answer, right?

66
00:03:03.185 --> 00:03:04.053
This is family feud.

67
00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:05.355
All right, so there we go.

68
00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:06.928
So I'm going to execute dev-env.

69
00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:07.703
There we go.

70
00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:09.627
I'm still copying over that special one,
but

71
00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:12.009
you'll notice that I'm now
copying over this tmux one.

72
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.864
So now my tmux config is this old version.

73
00:03:14.864 --> 00:03:18.314
I'm just going to do
a quick tmux kill-server.

74
00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:19.201
So this is fantastic.

75
00:03:19.201 --> 00:03:21.440
So now we have it set up that
I have this version down.

76
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.390
So if I go in here and I go,
cat -/.config/tmux/tmux.conf,

77
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.377
this is literally the one I said.

78
00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.827
Notice that I haven't even
updated this part right here.

79
00:03:32.827 --> 00:03:34.557
So let's kind of fix that.

80
00:03:34.557 --> 00:03:37.487
Let's go over here and
I'll go, what is it called?

81
00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:40.528
Dev-env, and we'll even build this old
navigation here in just one second.

82
00:03:40.528 --> 00:03:43.858
You'll notice that this now looks
officially different, it's bright blue.

83
00:03:43.858 --> 00:03:44.743
We're in a different world.

84
00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:50.565
All right, fantastic,
and I'm gonna go here,

85
00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:58.382
and I want to go XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/-
what is it called?

86
00:03:58.382 --> 00:03:59.738
It's called Nice.

87
00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:03.795
I'm gonna go, I always forget that one.

88
00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:07.512
That's such a funny name, right?

89
00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:10.008
All right, it didn't even save it.

90
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:15.491
All right, XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux,

91
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.942
that took me way too long.

92
00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:22.636
Wow, wow, and
I'm going to go dev-env, there we go.

93
00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:26.544
Now we should have that I should
be able to space R, no such file.

94
00:04:26.544 --> 00:04:29.476
Let me just make sure that this all works.

95
00:04:29.476 --> 00:04:31.176
Tmux kill-server.

96
00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:35.474
And now if I do a new tmux session,
I should be able to go leader R,

97
00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:37.322
configuration reloaded.

98
00:04:37.322 --> 00:04:39.665
So if I make a change now,
we got it all done.

99
00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:42.815
We're now running, we're now in the
future, things are feeling really good, so

100
00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.300
I'm going to leave tmux for a second and

101
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.209
we're going to talk a little bit about it,
okay?

102
00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:50.405
So if you've never played around with
tmux, it's actually quite fantastic.

103
00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:54.616
So you can just execute tmux, it'll just
open your current directory you're in, and

104
00:04:54.616 --> 00:04:56.008
this creates a new session.

105
00:04:56.008 --> 00:05:00.546
A session is comprised of one or
more windows, a window can have one or

106
00:05:00.546 --> 00:05:01.336
more pane.

107
00:05:01.336 --> 00:05:04.971
So if you think about it, the pain is this
thing where we're actually doing this in.

108
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:05.904
The window is this right here.

109
00:05:05.904 --> 00:05:10.048
Notice that it says one and zsh, zsh is
the program that's running, and then 0,

110
00:05:10.048 --> 00:05:11.145
this is the session.

111
00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:13.062
So session, window, pane.

112
00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:15.112
Just kind of intuitively makes sense,

113
00:05:15.112 --> 00:05:19.147
like everything's kind of set in that
kind of motion of being three deep, and

114
00:05:19.147 --> 00:05:21.835
so if I wanna create a second window,
I go prefix c.

115
00:05:21.835 --> 00:05:26.397
So now depending on whether or
not you used my script right there and

116
00:05:26.397 --> 00:05:31.382
you have Ctrl+B remapped to Ctrl+A,
then Ctrl+A is your prefix key.

117
00:05:31.382 --> 00:05:34.005
So in tmux,
it intercepts all of your keys and

118
00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:36.842
then forwards it on to
the underlying terminal.

119
00:05:36.842 --> 00:05:41.357
But if you do Ctrl+A, or whatever your
prefix is, it holds on to that until

120
00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:45.388
you do an action, so it knows okay
I'm now in tmux operating mode.

121
00:05:45.388 --> 00:05:49.940
I will let you do whatever you need to do
and forward on that action to tmux, or

122
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.086
if you do it twice, so if I go in vim.

123
00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:53.720
If I open up this thing, go test.

124
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.870
If I go like this, I go Ctrl+A, so

125
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.812
Ctrl+A will automatically
increment the next number in vim.

126
00:05:59.812 --> 00:06:03.744
So I have to do it twice to pass it
through to the underlying terminal.

127
00:06:03.744 --> 00:06:04.400
So there you go.

128
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.477
That's a prefix.

129
00:06:05.477 --> 00:06:07.532
So everyone knows what the prefix is,
feeling good.

130
00:06:07.532 --> 00:06:12.951
And notice when I did p prefix c,
it creates a new window.

131
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:14.680
So I've created two new windows.

132
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.550
So now I have 3, I have 2, and I have 1,

133
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.574
which means I can go prefix two, and
I'll navigate to my second window.

134
00:06:22.574 --> 00:06:24.950
Prefix one,
I can navigate to my first window.

135
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.186
So you can have these
nice little navigation.

136
00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:28.304
You'll see a nice little
thing right there.

137
00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:29.979
So these are effectively tabs.

138
00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:35.129
So now I'll notice that I have
multiple windows in my one session.

139
00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.438
That's pretty nice, right?

140
00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:39.774
So that means I can go like this,
tmux d to detach.

141
00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.427
Let's see Ctrl+AD to detach.

142
00:06:42.427 --> 00:06:45.142
And so now that I've detached from
the tmux, it's still running.

143
00:06:45.142 --> 00:06:47.031
So whatever's going on there,
it's still running.

144
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:51.087
It's still living its own life,
which means I can see the personal and

145
00:06:51.087 --> 00:06:52.891
I can do a new tmux experience.

146
00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:56.196
So now I have one tmux running over
here in a certain directory, and

147
00:06:56.196 --> 00:07:00.044
now I have another one in a different
directory in personal that's running.

148
00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:01.544
So you're, okay, this is pretty nice.

149
00:07:01.544 --> 00:07:05.960
So that can have my own little windows
over here and this one in the personal,

150
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.030
and I have one in my home directory.

151
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.675
It's pretty nice, so
I can attach, you can detach.

152
00:07:10.675 --> 00:07:14.097
If I detach, I can go tmux a, which
is short for attach, and if I attach,

153
00:07:14.097 --> 00:07:16.813
it'll attach to the previous
last one that was running.

154
00:07:16.813 --> 00:07:20.028
So that one's the one that
I went to personal and did.

155
00:07:20.028 --> 00:07:21.200
Okay, pretty nice.

156
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.923
I can also show all running sessions.

157
00:07:22.923 --> 00:07:26.068
Prefix w shows me that I have
this one right here, and

158
00:07:26.068 --> 00:07:28.007
I also have this one right here.

159
00:07:28.007 --> 00:07:30.700
So you can kinda see them,
you get a nice little view into it.

160
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.804
You can see, okay,
here's all the things that are happening.

161
00:07:33.804 --> 00:07:35.162
Here's all those.
So it's kinda nice to see what's

162
00:07:35.162 --> 00:07:35.681
available.

163
00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:39.093
I can press X which will say,
hey do you want to kill session 1?

164
00:07:39.093 --> 00:07:42.993
Yes, well I was just In session one, so
it booted me out of tmux, of course.

165
00:07:42.993 --> 00:07:47.552
So that means I can go tmux attach, and
I can attach to that other one, right?

166
00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:51.526
And so I can now go that I can do
a prefix w, I can see what's running.

167
00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:55.939
So you can kind of like work around and
play with tmux, it's pretty nice.

168
00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:58.411
You can also create panes pretty easily.

169
00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:04.654
If I go prefix quote or double quote,
it creates a horizontal pane.

170
00:08:04.654 --> 00:08:08.792
So for a lot of people, this might be
kinda weird, because you'd say, hey, man,

171
00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:10.822
that's pretty vertical in my opinion.

172
00:08:10.822 --> 00:08:14.382
You're right, it's vertically stacked,
horizontally split.

173
00:08:14.382 --> 00:08:16.468
So you gotta remember that,
that's always just the worst.

174
00:08:16.468 --> 00:08:18.986
You can do the same thing
with prefix percent sign.

175
00:08:18.986 --> 00:08:20.475
That does a vertical split.

176
00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:24.248
Again, horizontally stacked,
vertically split.

177
00:08:24.248 --> 00:08:29.209
Ctrl+D kills the actual underlying
terminal because you send the end to file

178
00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:30.132
experience.

179
00:08:30.132 --> 00:08:31.807
So it also closes the pane.

180
00:08:31.807 --> 00:08:33.533
Ctrl+D also closes the pane.

181
00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:34.697
I can do it again.

182
00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:36.006
And now I've closed that previous window.

183
00:08:36.006 --> 00:08:40.238
I can close window two, I can close window
one, and now there's just no more tmux.

184
00:08:40.238 --> 00:08:41.730
I just end of file, each one of those.

185
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.197
So it's just terminals.

186
00:08:43.197 --> 00:08:44.442
That's all it is.

187
00:08:44.442 --> 00:08:47.185
It's nothing kind of
wild is going on here.

188
00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:50.149
But I will say this, so
let's jump back in and

189
00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:55.306
let's create some of these to navigate
around in here can be a bit cumbersome.

190
00:08:55.306 --> 00:09:00.304
So what I like to do is I like to
have vim similar controls where

191
00:09:00.304 --> 00:09:05.009
I can do prefix h and
it will jump over to the one to my left.

192
00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:05.822
There you go, that's that direction left.

193
00:09:05.822 --> 00:09:10.190
I can do a prefix k and
go upwards, or is k up or down?

194
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.258
I can never remember.

195
00:09:11.258 --> 00:09:12.978
It just is inherently inside my head.

196
00:09:12.978 --> 00:09:14.045
I don't have to think about it.

197
00:09:14.045 --> 00:09:16.319
So I want to be able to go prefix k and
have it jump up.

198
00:09:16.319 --> 00:09:21.991
And so to accomplish that, if I scroll
down here, I can actually take these,

199
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:27.511
and I can add those to my my little
tmux config, which we should go cd dev-.

200
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:31.181
And if we're doing this correctly,
if we're doing this the right way, now,

201
00:09:31.181 --> 00:09:32.967
notice this is like crazy right here.

202
00:09:32.967 --> 00:09:35.076
I'm pretty sure I could do that, yeah.

203
00:09:35.076 --> 00:09:38.842
Prefix z will just zoom in that
one pane make it full level.

204
00:09:38.842 --> 00:09:41.549
All right, so if you're working in
a bunch of panes, you can do that.

205
00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:45.887
And so I'll go config/tmux, don't worry,
there's a point why I'm showing all this.

206
00:09:45.887 --> 00:09:46.814
There we go.

207
00:09:46.814 --> 00:09:49.214
Add these nice little things right there.

208
00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:51.777
Do a little dev-env to update everything.

209
00:09:51.777 --> 00:09:54.534
And then a little prefix r to refresh.

210
00:09:54.534 --> 00:09:59.309
And so now if I were to Ctrl+Z, go back
here, I should be able to go Ctrl+.

211
00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:01.591
I'm now over here,
Ctrl+HK, I'm now up here.

212
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:04.937
So now I have the same kind of vim
style controls to move around.

213
00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:08.648
Feels really easy for me in my very
small head to be able to do that,

214
00:10:08.648 --> 00:10:13.177
because with vim, it's Ctrl+W, for
window, K or J to be able to move around.

215
00:10:13.177 --> 00:10:14.627
So it's the exact same idea,

216
00:10:14.627 --> 00:10:17.470
except for I'm not just using
prefix that to jump around.

217
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.730
Okay, fantastic.

218
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.734
I want to show you all that because
mostly I never use any of those things.

219
00:10:23.734 --> 00:10:25.914
I use prefix c, all that.

220
00:10:25.914 --> 00:10:28.312
The reason why I tell
you all that is that, a,

221
00:10:28.312 --> 00:10:31.041
this kind of accomplishes
some things that I want.

222
00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:37.024
When I close a terminal,
I can just kill my terminal right here.

223
00:10:37.024 --> 00:10:40.811
And I can say, yes, I can kill that
terminal when I bring it back up,

224
00:10:40.811 --> 00:10:43.220
and I go, tmux, I'm now back in, right?

225
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.430
So it gives me 0.1.

226
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.646
This should be 0.3.

227
00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.318
I have tabs within sessions, right?

228
00:10:49.318 --> 00:10:52.442
So I can do that prefix c and
create a new tab.

229
00:10:52.442 --> 00:10:56.160
So this is two out of my six points,
just having tmux.

230
00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.240
And the reason why I showed you
all the rest of it is because

231
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.565
everything that I did
you can just program it.

232
00:11:03.565 --> 00:11:06.569
That means you can have a bash script
to do all the things we just did,

233
00:11:06.569 --> 00:11:08.045
which means that you can set up and

234
00:11:08.045 --> 00:11:11.288
create terminals the way you want,
configure them to be a certain size.

235
00:11:11.288 --> 00:11:14.269
You can even send over
resizing amounts to make it

236
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:17.845
into a certain amount of width
characters and do all that.

237
00:11:17.845 --> 00:11:19.531
So it's pretty magical.

238
00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:21.627
So let's kinda play around with that.

239
00:11:21.627 --> 00:11:22.929
So I'm in a session right now.

240
00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:26.432
So one big no no with tmux
is that if you go like this,

241
00:11:26.432 --> 00:11:31.158
you cannot create a session in a session
unless if you like mark around

242
00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:35.423
with tmux internals,
you unset this environment variable.

243
00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:38.141
I just recommend you don't
need to do that, you know why?

244
00:11:38.141 --> 00:11:41.029
Because if you give it the old -d,
that will detach it,

245
00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:44.848
which means it creates a new session
just detached from your current one.

246
00:11:44.848 --> 00:11:50.648
So now if I go Ctrl+AW, you can see I have
a nice little detached one right there.

247
00:11:50.648 --> 00:11:51.396
I can do it again.

248
00:11:51.396 --> 00:11:56.443
Do it a bunch of times, Ctrl+W,
you can see I have a bunch of them, right?

249
00:11:56.443 --> 00:11:58.451
Okay, this is getting a little bit easy.

250
00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.320
Now we're kind of seeing
where things are going.

251
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.836
Okay, so now we can build
something off of this, right?

252
00:12:02.836 --> 00:12:05.981
Maybe we can even build something
as good as that, right?

253
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:07.658
That's what we're hoping
to build right here.

254
00:12:07.658 --> 00:12:11.354
Notice that I navigated to a directory,
which is my own dev deck directory,

255
00:12:11.354 --> 00:12:14.556
it opened up vim, and it also gave
me a scratch window right here.

256
00:12:14.556 --> 00:12:16.007
Everything feels ready to go.

257
00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:16.647
I like the feel of that.

258
00:12:16.647 --> 00:12:20.062
It's fast, it's nice, it's smooth,
and I want it for everybody.

259
00:12:20.062 --> 00:12:21.985
Okay, so you get the idea.

260
00:12:21.985 --> 00:12:23.698
And so there you go.

261
00:12:23.698 --> 00:12:26.437
We can also list session, so
you can go tmux, list session,

262
00:12:26.437 --> 00:12:28.016
the nice first tab auto complete.

263
00:12:28.016 --> 00:12:29.366
Just pretty much works all the time.

264
00:12:29.366 --> 00:12:30.903
Hey, look at that,
does that look familiar?

265
00:12:30.903 --> 00:12:32.493
Look dev, dev is at the bottom.

266
00:12:32.493 --> 00:12:34.189
We just got done navigating there.

267
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.800
It has two windows.

268
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.416
All right, that's pretty neat.

269
00:12:37.416 --> 00:12:41.505
It also has attached session, so
you can just give it a session so

270
00:12:41.505 --> 00:12:44.023
I can go like this, tmux, what's it?

271
00:12:44.023 --> 00:12:47.180
Attach session and
then I go target dev and says,

272
00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.422
you can't do that 'cause again,
you're already in a session.

273
00:12:51.422 --> 00:12:54.379
So attached session works when
you're outside of tmux and

274
00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:56.258
you want to attach to a specific one.

275
00:12:56.258 --> 00:12:58.267
You don't want sessions in sessions.

276
00:12:58.267 --> 00:12:59.194
We are not exhibit.

277
00:12:59.194 --> 00:13:00.930
Yo dog, you don't like sessions.

278
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.891
We're not gonna put sessions in sessions.

279
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:06.583
Just remember that your life will be hell
if you start doing that, because then all

280
00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:09.861
sudden, it just becomes super hard
to reason about what's happening.

281
00:13:09.861 --> 00:13:13.950
So instead,
you can use something like switch-client,

282
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.963
and that will switch
over to the other one.

283
00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.405
So now we're in this one.

284
00:13:18.405 --> 00:13:20.836
So now you can start seeing how
we're gonna be building the script,

285
00:13:20.836 --> 00:13:23.069
you can start seeing kind of
the little pieces come together.

286
00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:24.274
Tmux is a pretty cool thing.

287
00:13:24.274 --> 00:13:25.718
You can also do has session.

288
00:13:25.718 --> 00:13:27.769
I'm gonna show you something
that's pretty annoying.

289
00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:28.987
I'm gonna go like this.

290
00:13:28.987 --> 00:13:32.352
I'm gonna go tmux new-session,

291
00:13:32.352 --> 00:13:37.927
I'm gonna give it a name,
let's call it foobar, okay?

292
00:13:37.927 --> 00:13:40.298
We're gonna call it foobar.

293
00:13:40.298 --> 00:13:45.934
I'm gonna go like this,
tmux has-session -target name, foo.

294
00:13:45.934 --> 00:13:48.193
Now notice that there's no errors.

295
00:13:48.193 --> 00:13:49.121
There's no nothing.

296
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:53.737
So if I go $?,
what was the outcome of that previous one?

297
00:13:53.737 --> 00:13:58.147
0, it successfully found
a session that was called foo.

298
00:13:58.147 --> 00:13:59.498
Why?

299
00:13:59.498 --> 00:14:04.374
Target with hash session does
like a prefix find into it.

300
00:14:04.374 --> 00:14:06.010
So it doesn't give you the exact result.

301
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.694
This one took me a long time to learn.

302
00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:11.229
If you put an equal sign on the other
hand, I don't even know how they do this.

303
00:14:11.229 --> 00:14:12.265
It sounds magical to me.

304
00:14:12.265 --> 00:14:16.038
You put an equal sign,
it does an exact match lookup.

305
00:14:16.038 --> 00:14:17.157
So just remember that.

306
00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:21.527
Just remember how that feels internally,
so you never forget that again.

307
00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:25.264
That always use Nico when you're
using half session, or else,

308
00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:29.498
it's just your life will just
dramatically worse if you don't do that.

309
00:14:29.498 --> 00:14:32.017
Okay, so now we're really feeling it.

310
00:14:32.017 --> 00:14:33.889
So we've kind of talked about session.

311
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:35.666
There's also a Windows API.

312
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:38.758
You can do the exact same
thing when I go Ctrl+A or

313
00:14:38.758 --> 00:14:41.030
prefix c, it creates a new window.

314
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:46.394
Well, so does new tmux new-window,
and that also creates a new window.

315
00:14:46.394 --> 00:14:49.191
You can even shorthand it for neww, right?

316
00:14:49.191 --> 00:14:52.299
Awesome, I can give neww a name, foobar.

317
00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:55.585
Now notice that number 6 is called foobar.

318
00:14:55.585 --> 00:14:56.992
Pretty neat, right?

319
00:14:56.992 --> 00:15:00.504
That means I can also do some cool things.

320
00:15:00.504 --> 00:15:02.508
There's also, list windows, select window.

321
00:15:02.508 --> 00:15:03.297
You can do that.

322
00:15:03.297 --> 00:15:07.393
You can also do things with the,
where was it?

323
00:15:07.393 --> 00:15:10.475
Where was the switch client?

324
00:15:10.475 --> 00:15:15.424
You can also go switch-client dev,
I want switch-client dev, number 5.

325
00:15:15.424 --> 00:15:17.237
And so that went to window number five.

326
00:15:17.237 --> 00:15:23.900
If you've named your windows,
tmux switch-client, I'll go dev:foobar.

327
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.039
You can go named session to named window.

328
00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:30.705
And I did that incorrectly
because I forgot the -t.

329
00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:34.487
So now you can see that you can
navigate around very specifically.

330
00:15:34.487 --> 00:15:37.646
I'm showing you all this because
we're getting there, don't worry,

331
00:15:37.646 --> 00:15:38.698
we're getting there.

332
00:15:38.698 --> 00:15:41.362
I just wanna make sure you really get it,
you internalize it.

333
00:15:41.362 --> 00:15:42.479
There's other fond APIs.

334
00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:44.626
This one's super cool and
is very, very useful.

335
00:15:44.626 --> 00:15:46.951
You can also do something like this.

336
00:15:46.951 --> 00:15:48.825
So let's switch back
client to number five.

337
00:15:48.825 --> 00:15:50.088
This one goes number six.

338
00:15:50.088 --> 00:15:55.804
So instead I go like this, send-keys,
I'm gonna target foobar, and

339
00:15:55.804 --> 00:16:00.871
I'm gonna go, echo hello,
I just sent those keys over there.

340
00:16:00.871 --> 00:16:04.189
I go, hello.

341
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:05.355
That's kind of neat.

342
00:16:05.355 --> 00:16:06.760
But it didn't enter it.

343
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.815
It only just sent the keys that I told it.

344
00:16:08.815 --> 00:16:14.090
So that means I can go back here and
I can send it the old, what is it?

345
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.471
I can send it the old Ctrl+M,
I can send it or the carrot M,

346
00:16:17.471 --> 00:16:19.205
which is the control signal.

347
00:16:19.205 --> 00:16:21.557
By the way, if you don't know
how to do control signals,

348
00:16:21.557 --> 00:16:23.375
Ctrl+V puts you into control signal mode.

349
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:26.259
Then you can do Ctrl+ V,
open bracket as an escape.

350
00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:28.331
Let's see,
I don't know why it's not working.

351
00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:32.078
Ctrl+V, open bracket, there you go.

352
00:16:32.078 --> 00:16:33.291
That's an escape signal.

353
00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:34.837
So you can send all those things.

354
00:16:34.837 --> 00:16:38.052
So I can just send this over plus an enter
signal so when it goes over here it,

355
00:16:38.052 --> 00:16:39.702
it actually executes it and sends it.

356
00:16:39.702 --> 00:16:44.025
So now you can even have panes, you can
send commands to, to do stuff for you.

357
00:16:44.025 --> 00:16:48.618
So you could go probably a little
too nuts here really easily and

358
00:16:48.618 --> 00:16:52.617
just build the world's
ultimate automation system.

359
00:16:52.617 --> 00:16:56.733
Me personally, I would just recommend
navigating and typing a little bit.

360
00:16:56.733 --> 00:17:01.358
Maybe you don't need to spend a hundred
hours on greatest thing just to run NPM

361
00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:04.215
run dev,
maybe you don't need to go that hard.

362
00:17:04.215 --> 00:17:05.241
I know, I'm kidding.

363
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:06.775
It's can go run.

364
00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:07.563
I get it.

365
00:17:07.563 --> 00:17:09.432
You guys, bunch of [INAUDIBLE] devs,
