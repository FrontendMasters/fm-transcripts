00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.741
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: All right, so I'm gonna
play around a little bit with Neovim,

2
00:00:03.741 --> 00:00:06.151
show you guys a few things about Neovim.

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:10.854
Let's show of hands, how many people
here are VS Coders, slash Zedders,

4
00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:13.328
all that the other side, yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:15.166
Anyone, Neovimers, any Neovimers in here?

6
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.104
Let's go, mana for my own heart.

7
00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:21.377
We got one people, [APPLAUSE] all right.

8
00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:22.703
That's all I wanna say,

9
00:00:22.703 --> 00:00:26.189
just because it's not that I'm
trying to convince you to use it.

10
00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.197
It's that I want to show you
guys what it can do, and then

11
00:00:29.197 --> 00:00:33.692
at some point in the future it might solve
your problems in a way that's different.

12
00:00:33.692 --> 00:00:37.088
Cuz one of the biggest problems,
and everybody has this problem,

13
00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:38.976
every last person has this problem.

14
00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:41.713
Right now, I've been using
Zed to solve some problems.

15
00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:42.700
Did I?

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.877
I deleted Zed.

17
00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:47.136
When I was doing all this,
I wiped out my local.bin.

18
00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:49.566
Zed was in local.bin,
I'm gonna have to reinstall Zed.

19
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:54.107
But you get the idea that everyone has
a notion of how something should be used.

20
00:00:54.107 --> 00:00:58.467
And when you use something different,
you try to make it into that.

21
00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:00.502
You see this all the time, especially
when someone learning a new language.

22
00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:03.511
If you've only ever done JavaScript and
you attempt to learn Go,

23
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:06.150
you're gonna try to write Go
like you write JavaScript.

24
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.896
And then you're gonna go, this language
sucks, and I'm gonna go, yeah,

25
00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:10.958
it kind of does suck.

26
00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.612
Not because it sucks, but
because how you use it kinda sucks.

27
00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:15.197
It's not really meant to be used this way.

28
00:01:15.197 --> 00:01:18.086
That's a bad way to approach it,
you shouldn't approach it that way.

29
00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:22.056
And so it's just like you always have to
kind of adopt a new mentality when you use

30
00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:22.892
something new.

31
00:01:22.892 --> 00:01:25.854
And so Neovim has its own way
you should use it and it's very,

32
00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:27.849
very different than how you use VS Code.

33
00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:29.985
And so if you go into Vim,
you try to make it into an IDE,

34
00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:31.156
you probably won't like it.

35
00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:33.757
It just probably will be really awful.

36
00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:35.521
It just won't be a good experience and
I don't blame you,

37
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:36.643
because I wouldn't like it either.

38
00:01:36.643 --> 00:01:39.430
All right,
creating your own Neovim experience.

39
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.240
I'm gonna give you a little brief look.

40
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.819
This isn't really a follow along section.

41
00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.925
If you already have Neovim set up,
you theoretically could.

42
00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:49.838
If you kinda have just a basic idea,
you could, but

43
00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:51.806
I'm just gonna kinda show
you a couple cool things.

44
00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:55.668
So, first off,
like we've kind of talked about dot files,

45
00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:58.631
Neovim also has its RC
file that gets started.

46
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:03.395
I'm gonna go into here, and
we had this under config neovim.

47
00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:06.875
I'm gonna replace this as nvim right here,
and it has a knit loop, so

48
00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:07.777
I have Hello fan.

49
00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:10.951
So if I were to execute dev-env and
then open up vim,

50
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:13.197
you'll notice that it prints this.

51
00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:16.534
And that's because that script
I just wrote executed and

52
00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:19.603
only had one line, print,
right, and that's it.

53
00:02:19.603 --> 00:02:22.008
And so
theoretically I could do a lot more.

54
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:27.066
Now, the nice part is that anything
that's on the path will be executed or

55
00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:28.792
will be included in vim.

56
00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:33.700
And so, one of the paths is config/nvim,
so my XDG path.

57
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.595
So anything in here I can now
incorporate into my Vim experience.

58
00:02:36.595 --> 00:02:39.925
So I can go in here and
create a folder called Lua, and

59
00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:43.559
inside of there I can create it as prime,
inside of here,

60
00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:48.285
I can have an init.lua, and
I can have print( hello from prime, right?

61
00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:53.619
Oopses, how do I even do that?

62
00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.338
That was weird.

63
00:02:55.338 --> 00:02:57.160
All right, there we go,
must have pressed something.

64
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.645
There we go, so we have that, and

65
00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.884
now I have this beautiful
little file right here.

66
00:03:00.884 --> 00:03:04.160
So I can now require in that prime file.

67
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.245
I can go, require("prime"),
and this will have that.

68
00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:09.976
That's not require, require.

69
00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:10.646
There we go.

70
00:03:10.646 --> 00:03:13.050
So anything that's in there,
can I figure it out?

71
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.526
There you go, it can figure that out.

72
00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:16.343
It can figure out that script.

73
00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:21.397
That means you can build kind of a complex
set of .files to really incorporate and

74
00:03:21.397 --> 00:03:25.426
run your neovim experience, and
this is really just the basic.

75
00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:29.356
You have an init file, anything that's
a source can have a Lua directory.

76
00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:31.602
Anything inside that Lua
directory can have subdirectories.

77
00:03:31.602 --> 00:03:33.947
Those subdirectories
are requireable by name.

78
00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:38.487
And so me personally,
I put all my .files under config neovim,

79
00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:40.260
Lua, the prime engine.

80
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.158
So that way I don't run into anyone else's
library, cuz if you just name it math,

81
00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:45.179
maybe there's gonna be
something called math, right?

82
00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:46.809
You don't wanna name it dumb things,
because or

83
00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.415
else you're just gonna collide and
it stinks.

84
00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:51.559
So I just have it as my name,
put it in there, and then it just works.

85
00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.195
So that means if I go in here and

86
00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:56.662
I quit this, and I do that, and
I bring this back up, and I vim,

87
00:03:56.662 --> 00:04:00.996
you're gonna notice this says hello
from prime, and then hello fem, right?

88
00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:02.581
So I went and did both of them.

89
00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:04.706
It required in my file, and
then it did the printing out and so

90
00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:05.846
everything's kinda running.

91
00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:07.684
So that's like the basic idea of this.

92
00:04:07.684 --> 00:04:08.898
It gets really extensive.

93
00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:12.928
If you actually want to get into
some level of neoviming and

94
00:04:12.928 --> 00:04:16.888
you wanna go do all that,
check out kickstart.neovim.

95
00:04:16.888 --> 00:04:19.660
I probably should add
the word Neovim in there,

96
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.043
cuz there's entirely too many things
called a kickstart in the universe.

97
00:04:24.043 --> 00:04:26.462
But if you went here,
you could go through and

98
00:04:26.462 --> 00:04:30.805
this just gives you the minimal file that
you need, it just gives you a net.lua.

99
00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:34.685
And the net.lua, when it opens up,
it has some nice little comments,

100
00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:36.051
some cool little ASCII.

101
00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:37.562
Look how cool that ASCII art is.

102
00:04:37.562 --> 00:04:42.074
And inside of here, it just has everything
you'd need to get Vim started as one file

103
00:04:42.074 --> 00:04:44.857
with a bunch of auto completing LSPs,
telescope.

104
00:04:44.857 --> 00:04:46.587
Everything you possibly need,

105
00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:49.410
shows you how to use package
manager all in one file.

106
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.375
And it's mostly comments, just to kind
of explain the whole thing and so

107
00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:54.811
it's pretty fantastic.

108
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:57.530
And so just like a thing, check it out.

109
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.410
It's a good way to get started.

110
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.629
I just wanna show you it's
very easy to get started,

111
00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:02.248
easy to create your own directories.

112
00:05:02.248 --> 00:05:04.510
That's all you need to know,
learn Kickstart.

113
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.880
Everything else is pretty fantastic.

114
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.505
All right, so now, we're gonna get into,
I don't wanna call them bragging moments,

115
00:05:11.505 --> 00:05:14.644
but we're gonna do some pretty
cool stuff with all of this.

116
00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:15.990
So let's see.

117
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.498
I had one more note about Vim.

118
00:05:17.498 --> 00:05:19.788
If you see someone that's
using something like Vim and

119
00:05:19.788 --> 00:05:23.023
they're using it really profesionally,
and you wanted to start with that,

120
00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:25.483
the best way to do that is to
start by learning Vim motions.

121
00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:26.935
Use your current editor, VS Code.

122
00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:29.508
Maybe you just wanna use the motions and
never use Vim ever.

123
00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:32.095
That's totally good, but
I would argue that Vim

124
00:05:32.095 --> 00:05:36.084
motions are an objectively better
experience than your mouse every time.

125
00:05:36.084 --> 00:05:40.808
You learn how to use them,
you will be significantly faster.

126
00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:45.798
The juice will eventually be worth the
squeeze if you want to get good at it, but

127
00:05:45.798 --> 00:05:49.137
at some point your mouse is
just not gonna be as good.

128
00:05:49.137 --> 00:05:51.937
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it similar to people
who are really good with spreadsheet

129
00:05:51.937 --> 00:05:52.558
shortcuts?

130
00:05:52.558 --> 00:05:55.655
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: Yeah, when you meet
anyone that knows a program really well,

131
00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:57.932
you go, wow, that's really cool, right?

132
00:05:57.932 --> 00:05:59.986
It's just because they've just
taken the time to learn it.

133
00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:03.292
The thing is I program for
30 to 50 hours a week.

134
00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:09.466
So, I should just learn these things,
because I'm constantly manipulating text.

135
00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:12.346
My only thing I do is take text, make
it into one shape, into another shape,

136
00:06:12.346 --> 00:06:13.975
into another shape, into another shape.

137
00:06:13.975 --> 00:06:15.908
And it's just this constant
act of doing that.

138
00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:19.093
And so you can do that in any editor,
it does not have to be Vim.

139
00:06:19.093 --> 00:06:24.251
Just learn a text like a keyboard
centric approach to your life, and

140
00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:29.424
it will pay off bigly as time goes on,
just not all that convenient.

141
00:06:29.424 --> 00:06:32.392
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's the Vim
motion to expand all the windows?

142
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.895
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: Expand all the windows?

143
00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:35.808
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: That one does not exist,

144
00:06:35.808 --> 00:06:38.451
because Vim does not have
that as an option, okay?

145
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:40.834
And you could, though, you could make it.

146
00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:42.283
I bet you you could do that,

147
00:06:42.283 --> 00:06:46.520
because you could write a little Lua
script that contacts your window manager.

148
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.915
And your window manager could
make all the things pop out, and

149
00:06:48.915 --> 00:06:51.091
then you could use your mouse,
and it'd be fantastic.

150
00:06:51.091 --> 00:06:55.803
Also, I said this earlier, which is, when
you're first using something like Vim,

151
00:06:55.803 --> 00:06:59.676
you probably have this experience
that makes you feel very confused.

152
00:06:59.676 --> 00:07:02.326
And that's because you
don't have a file tree.

153
00:07:02.326 --> 00:07:03.568
There's no file tree.

154
00:07:03.568 --> 00:07:06.130
So if you had a file tree,
all of a sudden,

155
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.006
it starts to look more
of what you're used to.

156
00:07:09.006 --> 00:07:13.799
And so whenever you look at something
that looks new, it feels very confusing.
