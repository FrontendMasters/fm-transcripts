00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.827
&gt;&gt; The Primeagen: Let's
keep on going right here.

2
00:00:01.827 --> 00:00:05.715
So we have that and so that means I have
already showed you this little control r,

3
00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:07.410
we did this little playing thing.

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.790
So now let's solve these last problems.

5
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.881
So what I wanna do is I want to
write a script that's going to allow

6
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:21.314
me to search specific directories, I want
to navigate based on the FCF results.

7
00:00:21.314 --> 00:00:22.829
I want to do all that.

8
00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.041
So what we're going to do is we're
gonna start with this script,

9
00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:31.637
this this MF script, this mother FCF
script, and we are going to get all

10
00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:36.615
the directories out of some directory
that I pointed to, and then we are going

11
00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:41.010
to clean the name of that directory so
can match tmux requirements.

12
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.423
tmux has some special characters, like
you're not supposed to use colons in your

13
00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:46.944
session name cuz if you did that
when you tried to do a target,

14
00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:48.246
it would screw everything up.

15
00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:50.378
There's all these rules and
stuff you shouldn't do,

16
00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:53.583
so we need to make sure we kinda clean out
the names and all that, so let's do that.

17
00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:56.847
So we're gonna get a selected directory,
then we're gonna clean it and

18
00:00:56.847 --> 00:00:57.979
create a nice tmux name.

19
00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:58.748
So we'll start there.

20
00:00:58.748 --> 00:01:01.754
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
jump in here, whoopsie daisies,

21
00:01:01.754 --> 00:01:03.137
I'm just gonna close out Vim.

22
00:01:03.137 --> 00:01:04.561
Screw Vim, I never liked it anyways.

23
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:06.545
All right, so now that I like this place,

24
00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:10.083
I'm gonna create another thing
called tmux-sessionizer, all right?

25
00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:15.429
And in here I'll do another user vin
fbash, okay, we're looking good.

26
00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.096
Yet another script,
how many times have we typed that?

27
00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:23.663
This has to be the most amount of batch
scripts if you're following along you've

28
00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:25.562
ever created in one day, don't lie to me.

29
00:01:25.562 --> 00:01:27.084
Don't lie, you know it's true.

30
00:01:27.084 --> 00:01:30.562
All right, so what we want to do is we
first want to find the selected directory.

31
00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:33.682
So I'm gonna go like this, selected
equals, and we're gonna go like this,

32
00:01:33.682 --> 00:01:35.459
I'm gonna use find, my favorite command.

33
00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.920
And how about this one,
let's only grab things out of personal.

34
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.662
Does that sound good?

35
00:01:38.662 --> 00:01:41.062
So only out of my personal stuff.

36
00:01:41.062 --> 00:01:43.911
I always do personal and work,
even though I don't have work.

37
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:47.707
I'm unemployed, I'm fun employed, and so
I just still have always maintained this

38
00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.720
personal and
work is kind of how I did things.

39
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.794
Okay, so I have this personal director.

40
00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:57.536
I'm gonna grab every single folder out
of there, so I'm gonna go mindepth 1 and

41
00:01:57.536 --> 00:01:58.381
maxdepth 1.

42
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:02.314
By the way, I just don't work at Netflix
anymore, I just don't, it's just too bad.

43
00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:06.125
All right, so I've mindepth 1,
maxdepth 1 type directory.

44
00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:09.057
And what I want to do is I'm
gonna pipe that result to FCF.

45
00:02:09.057 --> 00:02:12.389
Remember, find gives me every single
thing that's inside that directory,

46
00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.863
then FCF is gonna allow me to
fuzzy find over the top of it.

47
00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:16.670
So it's pretty fantastic right here.

48
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.973
So once we get that, if there is no
selected, meaning that if you Ctrl C,

49
00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:23.952
it cancels SCF,
which means it outputs nothing.

50
00:02:23.952 --> 00:02:28.719
So if there is no selected,
then we probably just need to exit, right?

51
00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.261
So I'll just do like a little exit 0,
fantastic.

52
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:34.899
So now I want selected name, which is
gonna have to be something we need.

53
00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.426
We need to clean the string
that was handed back to us.

54
00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:39.742
Well, what we're gonna do
here is I'm gonna like this.

55
00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:43.147
Base name, so I just want the name
of the folder of selected, right,

56
00:02:43.147 --> 00:02:46.733
that makes sense, spelled incorrectly and
didn't have a dollar sign,

57
00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:50.478
base name of folder, and then I wanna
pass it through something called TR.

58
00:02:50.478 --> 00:02:53.031
If you're not familiar with TR,
what does it stand for?

59
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:54.969
I don't know,
I don't know what it stands for.

60
00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.870
But what it allows you to do is you
can specify a list of characters and

61
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.265
then specify the replacements,
we'll call it to character replacement.

62
00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:05.506
So I'll go like this, I'll say,
hey, you can't have colons.

63
00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:06.360
You can't have commas.

64
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.217
You can't have periods.

65
00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:08.641
You can't have spaces.

66
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:12.036
And instead, I wanna replace that with
underscore, underscore, underscore, and

67
00:03:12.036 --> 00:03:12.610
underscore.

68
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.932
All of them are gonna be underscores.

69
00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:18.289
Now, just by simply doing that, we've
got selected, we've created its name,

70
00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.840
and we've cleaned it so it can be
a nice valid beautiful tmux name.

71
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.685
Okay, so I'm gonna like this just to
make sure I have everything correct.

72
00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:29.370
I'm gonna go like this, selected and
selected name, fantastic,

73
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.726
go right here, and
I'm gonna run local scripts sessionizer,

74
00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:36.291
there we go, so it's gonna do this.

75
00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:41.259
Let's just do caleb, and there we go so
it shows that I grab this right here, and

76
00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.015
then this is the name, caleb, fantastic.

77
00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.263
Okay, so
you can see what we're building here.

78
00:03:46.263 --> 00:03:50.663
We're building a way for us to be able
to say where we want to go, cleaning it,

79
00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:54.412
and now all we have to do is just
create all the tmux stuff, right?

80
00:03:54.412 --> 00:03:57.692
That's actually the easy part, it really
is the easy part if you think about it,

81
00:03:57.692 --> 00:03:59.443
okay, example code, how close did I get?

82
00:03:59.443 --> 00:04:04.837
Whew, almost identical, all right,
so now let's make the script good.

83
00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:09.125
We need to do if there is a session but
if there is I must have not even finished

84
00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:13.822
this thought, my brain was moving so fast
I was just like if there is a session, but

85
00:04:13.822 --> 00:04:16.368
my fingers only got to
if there is I moved on.

86
00:04:16.368 --> 00:04:20.616
All right, navigate to that session if
there is not a session editors notes

87
00:04:20.616 --> 00:04:23.795
then we need to create a session and
then navigate to it.

88
00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:25.840
Okay, everybody ready to do that?

89
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.084
Pretty straightforward, okay,
cuz what we're recreating is this.

90
00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:32.457
This is the thing that I use all the time,
absolutely fantastic.

91
00:04:32.457 --> 00:04:35.218
Again, reduces a lot of that
cognitive load, all right, so

92
00:04:35.218 --> 00:04:38.588
we gonna go like this, we're gonna go
back to here and let's erase this.

93
00:04:38.588 --> 00:04:39.952
We don't need to echo anything out,

94
00:04:39.952 --> 00:04:42.029
you don't wanna have your
scripts echoing things out.

95
00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.171
By the way, fun editorial note, if you're
gonna echo things out of your script,

96
00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:47.684
do it onto the error channel.

97
00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:52.135
Reason being is you can always
pipe air somewhere else, right?.

98
00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:56.052
But if you wanna hook programs up to
each other and pipe input in and out,

99
00:04:56.052 --> 00:04:59.396
you only want the important
stuff going out of standard out.

100
00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:01.537
You should do this with Node you
should do this with everything.

101
00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:06.203
Every time you ever build a CLI tool,
always use standard error for

102
00:05:06.203 --> 00:05:07.464
any of the stuff.

103
00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:11.988
And by the way, if you create a help menu
and you put that help menu in standard

104
00:05:11.988 --> 00:05:16.035
error, so help me, Linus Torvalds,
I will come after you, okay?

105
00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:19.568
Do not put that help menu in
standard error, that's ridiculous.

106
00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:22.263
Anyways, it's the only reason why is cuz
then you can't pipe it into Grep and

107
00:05:22.263 --> 00:05:24.711
search for an option then you have
to do like pipe ampersand into Grep,

108
00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:25.596
it's just ridiculous.

109
00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:28.696
All right, sorry, that was an odd rant,
and I did not prepare.

110
00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:31.717
I was not ready to have that rant,
but it came out of me, and

111
00:05:31.717 --> 00:05:33.397
it's befitting of the course.

112
00:05:33.397 --> 00:05:35.027
Okay, so we have our selected name,
we're gonna do this.

113
00:05:35.027 --> 00:05:37.957
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna like this.

114
00:05:37.957 --> 00:05:40.191
Let's go like this, tmux has session.

115
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:42.569
Now remember,
we wanna use that equal sign.

116
00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.394
Remember, if tmux has
selected name as the session,

117
00:05:47.394 --> 00:05:51.481
well then we can just navigate to it,
right?

118
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:54.513
So I can go tmux and
now we have to make some decisions here.

119
00:05:54.513 --> 00:06:00.985
What happens if tmux has that session,
but we're not in tmux, right?

120
00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:04.063
So there's some things
that can happen there.

121
00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:06.267
So we've gotta be a little
bit careful here.

122
00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:08.815
So I'm gonna go like this,
I'm gonna create a function,

123
00:06:08.815 --> 00:06:10.636
I'm gonna call it switch to, all right?

124
00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:12.799
And it's just gonna switch
to selected name for me.

125
00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:18.488
So I'm gonna go like this,
if tmux, let's see, what is it?

126
00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:21.630
If tmux exists or
if tmux doesn't exist, and

127
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.948
I'm sure we could make
this into the positive.

128
00:06:24.948 --> 00:06:28.342
But either way, this is my bash, I know,
so I'm gonna do the bash I know.

129
00:06:28.342 --> 00:06:33.934
If tmux does not exist then we
want to go tmux attach client.

130
00:06:33.934 --> 00:06:37.782
Cuz remember, we now want to attach to
that session or is it attach session?

131
00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:38.600
Which one is it?

132
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.503
Tmux attach session, whoo,
it's switch client attach session.

133
00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:46.206
It is what it is, okay, there we go, so

134
00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:48.969
we're gonna attach session to
the targeted, selected name.

135
00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:54.610
All right, fantastic,
else I want to tmux switch client.

136
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.104
So if we're in a tmux session,
we want to switch to the new session.

137
00:06:58.104 --> 00:07:00.746
We don't want to attach the new session,
cuz remember,

138
00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:02.627
can you attach to a session in a session?

139
00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:05.522
No, we don't like sessions
in our sessions, all right,

140
00:07:05.522 --> 00:07:08.904
do the exact same thing,
selected name, there we go, fantastic.

141
00:07:08.904 --> 00:07:12.976
So if we have this, we're just gonna
switch to, that's all there is to it.

142
00:07:12.976 --> 00:07:15.844
Bada bing, bada boom,
everything looks nice.

143
00:07:15.844 --> 00:07:18.625
So that means if we have a session
that matches the directory that

144
00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:21.712
we were looking for, we now can just
go right there, and we can have it,

145
00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:23.737
everything's fine, we don't do anything.

146
00:07:23.737 --> 00:07:25.891
Now this is where things get
a little bit more tricky.

147
00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:26.749
We now need to go and

148
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:30.197
we need to create a new session because
we clearly don't have that session.

149
00:07:30.197 --> 00:07:33.149
So we need to create a new session,
we need to switch to it.

150
00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:35.909
All right, deal, deal, done, let's do it.

151
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:39.996
So whoopsie daisies, what did I just do?

152
00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:45.027
I somehow branched my history,
there we go, all right.

153
00:07:45.027 --> 00:07:45.890
All right, so let's do that.

154
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.618
So let's write this, tmux,
I feel like I'm missing something that

155
00:07:50.618 --> 00:07:54.135
I'm just forgetting but
we'll see what happens.

156
00:07:54.135 --> 00:07:59.023
Selected, there we go, so what I did
is I just created a new session.

157
00:07:59.023 --> 00:08:02.939
So tmux isn't running, I just simply
created a new session somewhere,

158
00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:05.711
or if it's not running,
tmux now starts running.

159
00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:09.034
If it is currently running, it doesn't
matter, cuz we just create a new session.

160
00:08:09.034 --> 00:08:12.649
It's somewhere else, and now we can
actually attach to that session, so

161
00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:13.829
I can just go like that.

162
00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:18.881
That alone should be enough for us to
be able to do all the right moves here.

163
00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:25.142
Deal, deal, yes, we've done it,
we've done exactly what we wanted to do.

164
00:08:25.142 --> 00:08:28.591
Let's give this a little spin,
let's give this a little spin.

165
00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.894
Let's go to a local,
I'm gonna open this up.

166
00:08:31.894 --> 00:08:33.541
Let's try to see if we
can navigate to caleb.

167
00:08:33.541 --> 00:08:36.235
There we go, we navigated to caleb,
it just worked.

168
00:08:36.235 --> 00:08:39.901
It went, created a new session,
if I go control w you can see right here,

169
00:08:39.901 --> 00:08:40.695
created that.

170
00:08:40.695 --> 00:08:42.516
A little fun thing about tmux, or

171
00:08:42.516 --> 00:08:45.910
prefix capital L will take you
back to your previous session.

172
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.844
This is like alternate filed in Vim, it's
like the greatest thing in the universe.

173
00:08:49.844 --> 00:08:51.211
So now we're back to where we're at.

174
00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:52.999
Prefix capital L, prefix capital L.

175
00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:54.352
So we can just switch back and
forth between them.

176
00:08:54.352 --> 00:08:59.035
So often I'm working in two projects, it's
really nice to have that back and forth,

177
00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:01.456
it makes it really easy to go back and
forth.

178
00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:07.658
All right, awesome, so we did a good job.

179
00:09:07.658 --> 00:09:11.170
Also notice this right here,
can't find sessioncCaleb.

180
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.648
Whoopsie daisies, so
let's go over here and

181
00:09:14.648 --> 00:09:17.769
let's go pipe error output to dev null.

182
00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:21.217
We don't want our scripts to be loud,
we want it to be quiet, it should be nice.

183
00:09:21.217 --> 00:09:24.425
So just to test it one last time,
let's go to harpoon.

184
00:09:24.425 --> 00:09:28.319
There we go, harpoon did that, we go back,
it didn't make any noise, okay?

185
00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:31.321
We are really just,
lots of success is happening right now.

186
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:36.213
So let's go back to here,
and let's see what did I do?

187
00:09:36.213 --> 00:09:37.167
How did I do this?

188
00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:38.458
I did an if statement.

189
00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:39.859
Look at that, that's kind of neat.

190
00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:40.867
Okay, pretty neat.

191
00:09:40.867 --> 00:09:44.558
All right, so now remember previously,
y's in there, scripted tmux, wow,

192
00:09:44.558 --> 00:09:47.220
that's not even the right word,
I wonder how I did that.

193
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.310
It should be ready tmux, but
somehow, it's not ready tmux.

194
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.919
It just became scripted and
then with a y at the end.

195
00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:56.060
So remember our previous ready tmux,
what that says right there.

196
00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.299
It'd be nice if we could combine
our two scripts, right, correct?

197
00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:02.636
You're absolutely right,
it's not very hard.

198
00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:05.258
I think the script that I have
right there also has an error.

199
00:10:05.258 --> 00:10:08.464
So this one right here,
we just switched to it, it already exists,

200
00:10:08.464 --> 00:10:10.510
we don't want to execute that ready tmux.

201
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.280
But if it does and we have switched to it,

202
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.931
then we want to now execute that and
hydrate it, so how do we do that?

203
00:10:17.931 --> 00:10:20.370
Well, if we just go like this,
let's just do it for fun.

204
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.513
We're gonna go ready tmux right here,
okay?

205
00:10:22.513 --> 00:10:26.332
If I do that, we've switched to our new
client, and now we execute ready tmux,

206
00:10:26.332 --> 00:10:27.819
what exactly is gonna happen?

207
00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:30.247
Well here, let's go like this,
let's go to get test.

208
00:10:30.247 --> 00:10:34.369
We open that up,
look at what executed over here.

209
00:10:34.369 --> 00:10:37.871
It should have executed over here
cuz it won't execute over here.

210
00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:40.391
It should have executed right in here,
here let's go like this.

211
00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:43.796
Do we have,
I should have this right here, right?

212
00:10:43.796 --> 00:10:45.983
So that should have opened up a new thing.

213
00:10:45.983 --> 00:10:50.358
In other words, it should have executed.

214
00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:53.159
Let's just make sure that I'm not crazy,
yeah, I'll go like this.

215
00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:59.105
Ready tmux, and then in here I'll do,

216
00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:03.621
bin user, user bin and bash.

217
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:07.538
Hold on, hold on, we might have ourselves,

218
00:11:07.538 --> 00:11:13.016
we were like this, tmux,
new window, name, let's call it.

219
00:11:13.016 --> 00:11:17.677
This shouldn't happen, great name, right?

220
00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:22.669
It's executable, we're looking good,
if I go right here,

221
00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:25.457
and I go ready tmux, it does that.

222
00:11:25.457 --> 00:11:29.825
This shouldn't happen, so okay, we're on
the same page, we agree with each other.

223
00:11:29.825 --> 00:11:32.755
I call this thing ready tmux, which
I don't think it's called ready tmux.

224
00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:37.370
I think it's called ready with a dash,
that would be why it happened, okay,

225
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.654
dashes, turns out, are important.

226
00:11:39.654 --> 00:11:42.435
Underscores, less important
in this specific situation,

227
00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:43.804
well we'll re execute that.

228
00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:47.550
Let's go to falcore, you'll notice
that did we execute it right here?

229
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.053
I don't know,
did we execute it right here?

230
00:11:49.053 --> 00:11:56.190
We did, okay, we executed it in our dev
and we didn't execute it in falcore, why?

231
00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.751
When we switch a client that doesn't
switch the thing that's processing and

232
00:12:00.751 --> 00:12:05.592
executing, that process is still running
in that session inside that one space,

233
00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:09.046
we need to send ready tmux over
to the new session, right?

234
00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:12.485
So that's where that one
thing I showed you earlier,

235
00:12:12.485 --> 00:12:15.246
none of this was for
fun it was all serious.

236
00:12:15.246 --> 00:12:20.315
So we're gonna go like this,
we're gonna go target as selected name,

237
00:12:20.315 --> 00:12:25.810
and then we're gonna pass over ready tmux,
and then we'll pass over enter.

238
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.933
So now that's gonna send over to
that new session, hey, ready tmux.

239
00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:35.358
So now when we navigate it will also ready
our environment, pretty exciting, right?

240
00:12:35.358 --> 00:12:37.173
So let's go back to this one, right?

241
00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.026
This is, no, that's not the one,
which one is it?

242
00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:40.110
It was get test, right?

243
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.961
Get test, let me go into here,
this shouldn't happen.

244
00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:46.459
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go back to this one and

245
00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:48.373
I'm gonna destroy get test.

246
00:12:48.373 --> 00:12:50.671
Where's get test?

247
00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:53.227
There it is, I'm gonna just x that one,
yes, there we go.

248
00:12:53.227 --> 00:12:54.641
Get test does not work anymore.

249
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:58.391
So now if we go right here and
save that, and go right here and

250
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:01.841
we go our new little local execution and
we go get test,

251
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:06.191
you'll notice that it did that and
it also executed the scripts, but

252
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:10.564
this time on the get test side of
things because we sent the keys over.

253
00:13:10.564 --> 00:13:13.974
So this is like that cool part, I know you
were very excited about the sending keys.

254
00:13:13.974 --> 00:13:15.850
You can do a lot with the sending keys,
right?

255
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.870
You can make a lot of stuff happen.

256
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.468
And so I just love this,
I think this is super cool.

257
00:13:20.468 --> 00:13:23.429
And so now we can ready this
environment the exact way we want.

258
00:13:23.429 --> 00:13:26.917
So if you have three things you need
to run, you could pane them all out.

259
00:13:26.917 --> 00:13:29.171
And then pane one you do this,
and pane two you do that, and

260
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:30.094
pane three you do this.

261
00:13:30.094 --> 00:13:31.556
And everything just gets up and running.

262
00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:35.245
And it's not nearly the same kind of
dance you have to do every single time.

263
00:13:35.245 --> 00:13:38.788
Makes it really easy,
you could create tmux, what's it called?

264
00:13:38.788 --> 00:13:42.853
You could create tmux commands that
do an opposite unready tmux and

265
00:13:42.853 --> 00:13:47.570
it will check for an unready and kill all
your servers and then re ready them and

266
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.980
start them all back up again
if you need to refresh them,

267
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.710
like how many times a year do
you need to delete node modules?

268
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.736
Many, many, many, many times a year.

269
00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:59.471
And so, it'd be nice if you had delete
everything, restart everything.

270
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:02.532
So you could kind of script to your
whole environment of doing these kinds

271
00:14:02.532 --> 00:14:03.785
of things and make it really,

272
00:14:03.785 --> 00:14:07.121
really simple to where you're just going
no prefix capital R, just restart.

273
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:09.981
I just want to restart and
my restart scripts in this directory.

274
00:14:09.981 --> 00:14:12.536
So each directory could have
its own restart script.

275
00:14:12.536 --> 00:14:14.632
It just kind of makes
that really nice process.

276
00:14:14.632 --> 00:14:17.871
And so that's kind of the idea or
the goal I was hoping to do.

277
00:14:17.871 --> 00:14:21.139
And so now if we execute dev end,
tmux sessionizer will be on our path, and

278
00:14:21.139 --> 00:14:22.851
we can use this new tmux sessionizer.

279
00:14:22.851 --> 00:14:25.797
I already have a pretty sweet teamwork
sessioniser so I don't need it, but

280
00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:26.511
you get the idea.

281
00:14:26.511 --> 00:14:27.666
All right, so how do we execute that?

282
00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:30.399
We just get it on the path like we said,
and then from there you can execute it.

283
00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:32.711
I actually have mine set
up a couple different ways.

284
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:39.736
So my little fuzzy finding
mechanism if I'm in Vim and

285
00:14:39.736 --> 00:14:43.959
I look for, yeah, there we go.

286
00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:48.832
Whoopsies, there we go, what this does is,
when I'm in Vim, if I press Ctrl F,

287
00:14:48.832 --> 00:14:52.058
it will actually go out to tmux,
create a new window,

288
00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:56.320
and then just simply do tmux sessionizer
as the action on that window.

289
00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.533
So Ctrl F, you'll notice it
created a new window right here.

290
00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:02.716
I can do my fuzzy finding right here.

291
00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:07.560
When this process completes on tmux,
it automatically closes the window for

292
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.208
me cuz it no longer lives.

293
00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:12.869
So when I go back, notice I only have one
window now, I don't have two windows.

294
00:15:12.869 --> 00:15:16.524
So it opens it up for me just for
searching and then closes it back down.

295
00:15:16.524 --> 00:15:20.406
In tmux, if I'm in the middle
of something and I'm not in Vim,

296
00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:23.908
I can go prefix Ctrl F or
prefix F, or whatever it was.

297
00:15:23.908 --> 00:15:25.018
Did I actually take it away?

298
00:15:25.018 --> 00:15:28.202
Never mind, I took that away,
no, I didn't take it away.

299
00:15:28.202 --> 00:15:31.238
I did take it away, never mind,
forget that, I had it at one point.

300
00:15:31.238 --> 00:15:34.828
And then I also have it
in what's called in Zish.

301
00:15:34.828 --> 00:15:36.921
If I press Ctrl F, it also brings it up.

302
00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:38.478
So I kind of have it kind
of pasted throughout.

303
00:15:38.478 --> 00:15:39.935
I'm surprised it took away the tmux one.

304
00:15:39.935 --> 00:15:41.997
I thought I had that one in there for
a while.

305
00:15:41.997 --> 00:15:46.721
Wait a second, wait a second,

306
00:15:46.721 --> 00:15:53.026
that's because we have
the class example one.

307
00:15:53.026 --> 00:15:57.526
Let's just, let's see,
do I have it in here?

308
00:15:57.526 --> 00:16:00.762
Yeah, see I had it in here, okay,
so I did actually have it in here.

309
00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:04.090
I'm just being a goofball,
yeah, it's actually in there.

310
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.478
I swear, I swear it's totally in there,
okay, so it was in there.

311
00:16:07.478 --> 00:16:10.199
I just have the current example
one that we were using.

312
00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:11.824
So there we go, so
that's the way you could use that.

313
00:16:11.824 --> 00:16:14.389
So now if you theoretically
used something like that,

314
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:17.900
you can now navigate to any project,
have it hydrated the way you want, and

315
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.884
it only takes a couple keystrokes, and
it's really easy to navigate between them.

316
00:16:21.884 --> 00:16:24.907
The sessions last for a long time,
if you close down your terminal,

317
00:16:24.907 --> 00:16:26.135
none of your stuff breaks.

318
00:16:26.135 --> 00:16:32.067
For me, this is ten times more convenient
than using tabs, have ever had a terminal

319
00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:37.430
that has five, ten tabs open each
one's in these different directories.

320
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.858
They're all running different processes.

321
00:16:38.858 --> 00:16:40.834
So then you're like
switching between them.

322
00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:44.633
And it's always like tick or some
bizarre thing to switch in the terminal,

323
00:16:44.633 --> 00:16:46.335
it's just super inconvenient.

324
00:16:46.335 --> 00:16:48.985
I just can't live that life, honestly,
I just get too much anxiety.

325
00:16:48.985 --> 00:16:52.305
It's the same thing as like that with Mac,
blowing up all the windows and

326
00:16:52.305 --> 00:16:53.127
then searching.

327
00:16:53.127 --> 00:16:54.693
I never wanna live
the searching lifestyle.

328
00:16:54.693 --> 00:16:57.193
I never want to have to try to look for
the thing I want.

329
00:16:57.193 --> 00:16:59.601
I wanna just type it in and
make it happen.

330
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:05.175
I have a strong belief that
searching fatigue is a real thing.

331
00:17:05.175 --> 00:17:07.108
And so don't get search fatigue.
