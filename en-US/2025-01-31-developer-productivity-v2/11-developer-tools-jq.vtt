WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.102
We're gonna switch gears now and go into
some more important parts of life, okay?

2
00:00:05.102 --> 00:00:09.548
Which is, you should learn a bunch
of cool stuff when it comes to your

3
00:00:09.548 --> 00:00:11.351
operating system, okay?

4
00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:14.100
There's a lot of fun things
that are just available and

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.564
really what it comes down
to is the Unix tool set.

6
00:00:16.564 --> 00:00:23.471
I still remember this one time I had 2011,
I wanna say it is it might have been 2012.

7
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:27.467
Yeah, 2012, I went and interviewed for a
company called web filings at the time now

8
00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:31.089
known as we're Kiva publicly traded
company, Bozeman, Montana, Bozeman.

9
00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.333
And when I interviewed there, one of
the questions went along this lines.

10
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:40.980
We have been hacked and they put a bunch
of salacious links in our website,

11
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.924
viagra.com or something, right?

12
00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:47.850
My gosh, they're like very salacious and
so they're all throughout our website and

13
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.045
you need to go find them all and
delete them all.

14
00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:53.368
And this is during the day where
you still FTP a lot of the times,

15
00:00:53.368 --> 00:00:54.641
this is a long time ago.

16
00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.975
And so it's like, okay, so
that means we need to go find this.

17
00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:59.458
So what did I do,
as a budding young student?

18
00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:01.237
Well, I did the only
thing I knew how to do.

19
00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:05.571
I did public static void main args,
string args, did all that,

20
00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:10.793
got it in there, tokenized, walked
through all the files, every directory

21
00:01:10.793 --> 00:01:15.805
recursively walked through it,
did the whole thing all the way through.

22
00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:19.884
And then they're like, wow, that was
really good cuz you used anything else.

23
00:01:19.884 --> 00:01:21.129
So I'm like, I don't know, right?

24
00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:25.492
I had no idea if you could use anything
else cuz I didn't know that I could

25
00:01:25.492 --> 00:01:27.405
just simply use Zed, not Zed.

26
00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:31.194
If a Zed is an editor,
Sed is n not an editor.

27
00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:34.158
If I already knew the link I was
looking for, I could just find him and

28
00:01:34.158 --> 00:01:35.051
just replaced him.

29
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:37.871
If I just wanted the file and
locations, I could have used crap.

30
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:41.107
These things just didn't exist
in my head when I was younger,

31
00:01:41.107 --> 00:01:44.657
and I spent countless hours writing
programs that already exist and

32
00:01:44.657 --> 00:01:46.729
can be used in an ad hoc way all the time.

33
00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.246
And so don't be me, it's not good, right?

34
00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:54.228
Don't be me from the past or
the future really, don't be me either way.

35
00:01:54.228 --> 00:01:57.314
And so I'm gonna show you a bunch
of stuff that is just super great.

36
00:01:57.314 --> 00:02:00.998
If you do create your own tools, just
to always remember accept standard in,

37
00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:04.529
go on standard out for the output,
standard error for any sort of errors.

38
00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.288
Don't break that because then you
can chain things together, and

39
00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:09.611
chaining things together
makes your life really good.

40
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:10.370
Don't forget that.

41
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.567
All right, so FZF,
we don't really need to talk about FZF.

42
00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:17.440
We talked about FZF, FZF was great,
you saw how powerful it is.

43
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.486
So we're just gonna kinda
leave that one out and

44
00:02:19.486 --> 00:02:22.621
not because I want to leave it out
because you guys already know about it.

45
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:25.140
All right, so we're gonna talk
about one really cool one.

46
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.882
This is like a hidden
treasure of the CLI tools.

47
00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:32.543
Okay, there appears to be
only a few of you here.

48
00:02:32.543 --> 00:02:35.477
Hands up, who knows about JQ?

49
00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:40.146
Okay, half of the people
here know about JQ.

50
00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:43.790
Which is always kinda
shocking because JQ is

51
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.724
an exceptionally convenient
thing to have on your system.

52
00:02:48.724 --> 00:02:51.603
You will be just blown
away by how amazing it is.

53
00:02:51.603 --> 00:02:56.454
And I will tell you personal side story,
that I have probably saved 100 to 200

54
00:02:56.454 --> 00:03:01.170
hours worth of programming by spending
five minutes learning a couple things and

55
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.765
asking ChatGPT, how to do various things.

56
00:03:03.765 --> 00:03:05.382
It works actually pretty well with GPT.

57
00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:08.600
GPT knows exactly what to do with this
one cuz this falls under GPT best thing,

58
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.139
which is, it only has so
many options, and it can just do it.

59
00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.212
So this is really, really good,
very hard for it to hallucinate,

60
00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:18.437
though it still figures out
how to do it even with JQ.

61
00:03:18.437 --> 00:03:20.137
All right, so let's create this file.

62
00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:25.067
If you guys wanna follow along,
create a really simple file

63
00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:29.019
that has a type that is foo or
bar just two types.

64
00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.865
It doesn't really matter what they're,
I just want them to be distinct, and

65
00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:35.042
then I want a values
array that are numbers.

66
00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:38.692
And then the other one, I want it to
be a values dictionary with a and b.

67
00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:40.033
They're intentionally different.

68
00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:46.895
Foo has an array, bar has a dictionary,
okay, or an object.

69
00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:49.995
Since this is Javascript object notation,

70
00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:53.018
it would be an object a POJO,
it has a POJO.

71
00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:55.874
So now that we have that file here,
I should probably copy and

72
00:03:55.874 --> 00:03:57.050
paste this file myself.

73
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.150
I'm gonna copy it and jump over here.

74
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.790
We can just do it in the dev directory,
it really doesn't matter.

75
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.682
So I'm gonna jump over here.

76
00:04:03.682 --> 00:04:06.823
Not the dev directory, dev-env directory.

77
00:04:06.823 --> 00:04:13.691
All right, so I'm gonna jump over here and
I'm gonna create a file called out, right?

78
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.950
It doesn't really matter, I don't
really care what this thing is called.

79
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.525
There we go, it has all these
beautiful things in it, okay?

80
00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:20.685
There we go, there's all of our items.

81
00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:23.940
And so now if I go here and
I cat out, there they all are.

82
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.325
Okay, everyone sees them?

83
00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:25.991
They're right there.

84
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:27.693
So here's some cool things
you can do with JQ.

85
00:04:27.693 --> 00:04:29.398
We're gonna start with something really,
really simple.

86
00:04:29.398 --> 00:04:32.540
You can either pipe it to JQ or
JQ can read it as a file.

87
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.633
So if I pipe cat or cat out piped into JQ,
and now makes them all pretty.

88
00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:41.732
Look at all that, look how nice that is.

89
00:04:41.732 --> 00:04:47.507
You can then re-pipe that into the JQ and
make it compact.

90
00:04:47.507 --> 00:04:49.169
That's pretty cool, right, look at that.

91
00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.798
Okay, that's just a little bit of cool,
just a little bit of cool.

92
00:04:51.798 --> 00:04:53.129
Notice it's by line.

93
00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.339
So that way you could have,
like imagine you have log files and

94
00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:59.575
you need to go through thousands
upon thousands of log files.

95
00:04:59.575 --> 00:05:04.472
You can now start saying, okay, I can see
this thing becoming inherently useful.

96
00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:07.191
Just wait,
we're gonna get way more awesome.

97
00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:09.597
I think I'm jumping ahead,
you have prettify log files.

98
00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:10.761
You can also do it this way, right?

99
00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:14.650
JQ with no first argument, and
then the file it wants to read, and

100
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.290
I'll just do that as well.

101
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.211
I'm always just in the habit of cating the
file and then piping it, I don't know why.

102
00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:21.488
Okay, this is just who I am.

103
00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:24.677
All I know is, every single time I
do that, there's always some guy,

104
00:05:24.677 --> 00:05:27.339
grep actually can take a file and
it's just like, I know.

105
00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.187
I just don't remember, it's just who I am.

106
00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:32.069
Okay, all right, so check this out.

107
00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.012
Do you see this thing right here?

108
00:05:34.012 --> 00:05:36.161
All this stuff, what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna do something.

109
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.219
Okay, I'm gonna do something,
it's gonna get a little weird here.

110
00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.192
I'm gonna go back to devprod-2.

111
00:05:40.192 --> 00:05:42.148
I'm going to search for,
wait, what was it?

112
00:05:42.148 --> 00:05:48.267
Check this out, okay, so here it is.

113
00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:50.340
There's that data that I just showed you,
right?

114
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.836
It's big, okay, I'm in vim right now.

115
00:05:52.836 --> 00:05:56.082
This is fully unprettified version.

116
00:05:56.082 --> 00:06:00.008
I'm gonna grab this and
I'm gonna highlight all of this, and

117
00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:03.870
I'm gonna take this, and
I'm gonna pipe that out to jq-c.

118
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.996
Look at that, right, in your editor.

119
00:06:04.996 --> 00:06:09.422
You can actually use your editor
to manipulate with JQ as well,

120
00:06:09.422 --> 00:06:11.437
which makes it even better.

121
00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:13.460
Now, this does, I'm sure,
what's it called?

122
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.750
VS code has ways in which you can send
stuff out to something like JQ and

123
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.661
then have it edit it and
then replace the text and do all that.

124
00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:22.622
JQ just allows really fun stuff.

125
00:06:22.622 --> 00:06:26.363
So if you just had a log file that you
knew you could do destructive operations

126
00:06:26.363 --> 00:06:29.885
on, you could do stuff, see what it does,
and go, okay, I like this.

127
00:06:29.885 --> 00:06:31.016
Okay, I like this, I like that.

128
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.150
Okay, good, boom, it's in the right setup.

129
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.817
Now I'm happy.

130
00:06:33.817 --> 00:06:35.733
Now I can walk away and so
you can do stuff like that,

131
00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:37.037
which makes it super, super fun.

132
00:06:37.037 --> 00:06:39.336
Absolutely think this is just
the best way to do things.

133
00:06:39.336 --> 00:06:42.425
All right, sorry for the little detour.

134
00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:44.188
I'm really sorry,
that's actually pretty awesome.

135
00:06:44.188 --> 00:06:46.178
All right, so, let's look at the data.

136
00:06:46.178 --> 00:06:51.637
Let's pretend we want to sum
all the foo values per struct.

137
00:06:51.637 --> 00:06:54.426
You had a log that had
a list of numbers and

138
00:06:54.426 --> 00:06:57.229
you just wanted the sum out of each line.

139
00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.615
If you're not familiar with JQ,
you'd probably naturally just reach for

140
00:07:01.615 --> 00:07:06.504
a node program, cuz J sounds really easy,
or maybe rust and define all your stuff.

141
00:07:06.504 --> 00:07:08.349
And you do something, right?

142
00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:10.073
You would probably reach for a program.

143
00:07:10.073 --> 00:07:12.461
Well, that's generally pretty annoying.

144
00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:15.749
I would say, when you can just go cat,
let's just cat the out.

145
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:17.421
I know you can provide the file, shut up.

146
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:18.979
All right, so let's go like this.

147
00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:19.961
Let's go select.

148
00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:24.973
So this allows us to select objects
that have a certain thing about them,

149
00:07:24.973 --> 00:07:26.542
something like this.

150
00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:30.129
How about, if ( .type == "foo"),
There we go.

151
00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:31.923
If I just execute that,
look at what I get.

152
00:07:31.923 --> 00:07:35.992
I only get two results,
I just get the two foo lines.

153
00:07:35.992 --> 00:07:40.254
Okay, so now I'm selecting the things
out I want, that's pretty nice.

154
00:07:40.254 --> 00:07:43.862
Well, then I can take that and
I can pipe it in, or

155
00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:46.775
I can just select out, say the values.

156
00:07:46.775 --> 00:07:48.736
Okay, that's pretty nice.

157
00:07:48.736 --> 00:07:53.701
Now I can take that and I can add
them all together, and there we go.

158
00:07:53.701 --> 00:07:57.827
So I just went through,
I filtered my objects,

159
00:07:57.827 --> 00:08:02.790
grabbed out a property and
then summed on that property.

160
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.712
It's pretty great, right?

161
00:08:04.712 --> 00:08:09.186
I mean, I think that's pretty great,
by the way,

162
00:08:09.186 --> 00:08:12.422
JQ does not stand for jQuery, okay?

163
00:08:12.422 --> 00:08:17.024
JQuerius is very upset
about this land grab.

164
00:08:17.024 --> 00:08:19.113
It's not true, no matter what people say.

165
00:08:19.113 --> 00:08:22.204
All right, so
let's do the same thing again, but

166
00:08:22.204 --> 00:08:27.004
this time, I don't wanna do a destructive
operation where I lose my object.

167
00:08:27.004 --> 00:08:33.205
Okay, so what I wanna do is I can go like
this, valueSum equals, I think it's this.

168
00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:34.556
I may have to remember again.

169
00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:37.974
So forgive me if this doesn't work,
it does work.

170
00:08:37.974 --> 00:08:39.657
Okay, there we go.

171
00:08:39.657 --> 00:08:41.980
We now did type foo values.

172
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.616
And then I created another
object called valueSum and

173
00:08:45.616 --> 00:08:47.968
they're now still JSON objects.

174
00:08:47.968 --> 00:08:50.079
So that's super good, right?

175
00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:53.175
Now we're actually able
to do operations and

176
00:08:53.175 --> 00:08:56.850
change the underlying object
itself really easily.

177
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.082
Again, I can't tell you just how much
time these type of things have saved me

178
00:09:00.082 --> 00:09:00.599
in my life.

179
00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:04.388
I don't have to write programs,
I don't have to do line by line stuff.

180
00:09:04.388 --> 00:09:09.135
And it'll get even better when I show
you other tools that you can use

181
00:09:09.135 --> 00:09:12.638
with JQ at the exact same time,
we'll get there.

182
00:09:12.638 --> 00:09:15.105
Which is pretty great.
So now you can even do even further

183
00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:20.366
amazing stuff, which is we can take
this and we can re-select on top of it.

184
00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:26.178
I only want things with a valueSum
that is greater than 20.

185
00:09:26.178 --> 00:09:27.921
Now it only gives me that one that
has a sum that's greater than 20.

186
00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:32.867
So you can keep on filtering and selecting
and doing these really cool kinda ad hoc

187
00:09:32.867 --> 00:09:36.953
operations, that allow you to kinda
filter through job or a JSON.

188
00:09:36.953 --> 00:09:40.322
And so there's just a tool and
you should just get familiar with,

189
00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:44.561
at least know it exists, get it on your
system, and then talk to ChatGPT about it.

190
00:09:44.561 --> 00:09:49.323
And GPT will probably help you do a lot of
cool stuff, I've used it a ton of times.

191
00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:51.175
I just wanted to show you that it exists,

192
00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:54.013
this will just massively improve
your life knowing about it.

193
00:09:54.013 --> 00:09:58.155
And you can do all this fun stuff like
this just giant thing that we're doing

194
00:09:58.155 --> 00:09:58.890
right here.

195
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.631
Theoretically I could grab that whole
thing, jump into here, highlight this, and

196
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:07.592
do the exact same thing, and
now we just have a single item right here.

197
00:10:07.592 --> 00:10:09.609
So I can do cool destructive things.

198
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:14.145
So if you figure out how to do it in your
editor, you can do all that, I mean,

199
00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:15.802
just think that's great.

200
00:10:15.802 --> 00:10:17.138
All right, fantastic.
