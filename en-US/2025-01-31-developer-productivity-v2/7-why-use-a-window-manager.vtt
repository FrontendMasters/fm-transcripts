1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
So we're gonna kinda move on to a new
section, which is called navigation.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.037
For a lot of people,
I feel you don't think about navigation.

3
00:00:06.037 --> 00:00:11.447
I can't tell you how many times I've
seen someone do this move on a Mac,

4
00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:15.789
all the windows show up, and
then they click something.

5
00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.565
And I get a cortisol response, I actually
go into the this anxiety ridden, space,

6
00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:26.944
and I'll just be messed up for hours
afterwards be how do they live that life?

7
00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:31.173
I'm not gonna say it the Twitter way, but
they live that life, and that's crazy.

8
00:00:31.173 --> 00:00:34.312
And so I can't do it.

9
00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:38.485
So navigation, I think, is pretty much the
most important aspect of your operating

10
00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:40.679
system, comparatively to your dot files.

11
00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.436
Long as you have a good environment and
you can get started really quickly and

12
00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:45.819
you never have to think about that again,
that's good step one.

13
00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:48.120
Step two is how do you get
to where you're going?

14
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.174
I think that's really important question
that people just don't ask, and

15
00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:53.450
also don't optimize.

16
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.570
To the point where you're trying to solve
the point 5% the thing you do once a week,

17
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.919
or maybe even once a month.

18
00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:02.154
To me, I don't really,
I attempt to optimize that, unless,

19
00:01:02.154 --> 00:01:03.628
if it really is bothersome.

20
00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:06.717
If I do it once a week, but
it takes me 30 minutes to do it,

21
00:01:06.717 --> 00:01:09.569
maybe I need to think about
how can I make this faster?

22
00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.889
But if I do it once a week and
it takes me one second to do it,

23
00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.841
I have to click one extra button.

24
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.508
Just not worth my time, right?

25
00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:20.215
And so
I always just try to solve that 99%.

26
00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:22.423
And I want to be able
to do it in one button.

27
00:01:22.423 --> 00:01:25.231
That's why I like to be able to go here or
here or here.

28
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:27.268
If you notice that when
I did the MF Ansible,

29
00:01:27.268 --> 00:01:30.527
I was able to just kinda go there
really quickly at a nice, fuzzy find.

30
00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:34.590
All of that falls under go back to my
previous project, which is my dev end.

31
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.134
All of that is navigation, right?

32
00:01:36.134 --> 00:01:38.684
I wanna be able to go to any
project as fast as possible.

33
00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:42.534
I don't wanna have to go through
this long process of navigating or

34
00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:46.517
clicking a bunch of directories in
a file tree to go open up a new one and

35
00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:49.566
then clicking open and
then a new instance comes up.

36
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:50.797
I don't wanna go through all that.

37
00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:54.776
I just want it to be fast and
just right there, all right?

38
00:01:54.776 --> 00:01:57.229
So probably the biggest
thing you need to get into,

39
00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.408
which I don't know how
many of you have a win.

40
00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:01.921
I see a bunch of mackintoshes
as they're called.

41
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:06.133
I think it's yabai y-a-b-a-i, yabai.

42
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:06.959
Is that correct, anyone?

43
00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.555
There's windows managers.

44
00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:10.801
Get a window manager.

45
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:13.740
It's single handedly the most
important thing you can do for

46
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.648
your life is getting a window manager.

47
00:02:15.648 --> 00:02:17.633
Never place a window again.

48
00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:24.386
And Mac's default window settings is
hands down like an LSD experience.

49
00:02:24.386 --> 00:02:25.531
It makes no sense.

50
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:28.052
Everything you're doing
is completely bonkers.

51
00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:31.009
You go up, it expands this way,
but not that.

52
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.269
Everything about it is
just super inconvenient.

53
00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.366
There's no ways to place windows nicely.

54
00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:38.852
Every time you go to anyone's desktop
that doesn't use a window manager,

55
00:02:38.852 --> 00:02:40.638
it's just filled with 20 windows.

56
00:02:40.638 --> 00:02:44.121
All slightly stacked on each other,
all in slightly different spaces,

57
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:45.787
all of slightly different sizes.

58
00:02:45.787 --> 00:02:48.771
It's just like, why would you like,
I watched my wife do this, and she's like,

59
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.996
trying to find stuff, and I'm like, Babe,
you're gonna you're killing yourself.

60
00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:55.516
Don't do this, don't spend all
that mental effort searching.

61
00:02:55.516 --> 00:02:57.879
That's just so bad and so don't do that.

62
00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.756
And so
if you're still placing Windows manually.

63
00:03:00.756 --> 00:03:02.947
You're living in the Stone Age,
that's just a or

64
00:03:02.947 --> 00:03:06.197
you're not even living in the stone
age they actually had it figured out.

65
00:03:06.197 --> 00:03:09.733
You're living in the 1999 era, where they
thought everything should be a GUI and

66
00:03:09.733 --> 00:03:11.513
everything should be fantastic, right?

67
00:03:11.513 --> 00:03:14.827
Stop living in that era,
that's a terrible era to live in.

68
00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:18.313
Window managers, it's not gonna be
a large part of this course, but

69
00:03:18.313 --> 00:03:20.968
it's the basis for
how I approach everything here.

70
00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:25.229
From here on out, I approach things in
a very, very simple set, or a very,

71
00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.244
very simple way,

72
00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:30.395
is I want everything to be these
progressive squares of getting closer.

73
00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:31.911
It's kinda playing golf, right?

74
00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:35.321
With golf, you start off with the big
club going towards the green.

75
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:39.067
When you're on the green, you're trying to
get within a trash can lid of the hole, or

76
00:03:39.067 --> 00:03:40.694
in the hole when you're that close.

77
00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:41.558
It's an easy put in, right?

78
00:03:41.558 --> 00:03:43.924
You're just progressively
making your target smaller.

79
00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:48.255
And so with a window manager, I want
to be able to have one button click and

80
00:03:48.255 --> 00:03:51.167
I want to be able to go to say my browser,
Chrome.

81
00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:53.907
I want to be able to go to
my terminal with one button.

82
00:03:53.907 --> 00:03:57.537
I wanna be able to go to say my,
what happens if I have my Twitch streaming

83
00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.911
stuff, my Twitch chat or
whatever over here.

84
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:02.714
I want each one of those to be one button,
and that's it.

85
00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:05.674
So that way, when I'm coding,
I'm right here, when I want to be here,

86
00:04:05.674 --> 00:04:06.414
I'm right here.

87
00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:08.250
I'm a one monitor kinda person.

88
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.756
I do not like multiple monitors.

89
00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:13.552
I find myself just getting super
distracted when I have multiple monitors,

90
00:04:13.552 --> 00:04:16.590
because it's so easy to be man,
there's Twitter, right?

91
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.491
You just don't even have it as an option,
right?

92
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.490
And then it's just really easy.

93
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.432
That's me, I have lack self-control.

94
00:04:21.432 --> 00:04:23.817
So I control myself through other means.

95
00:04:23.817 --> 00:04:25.835
It's very easy for myself.

96
00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:29.382
And so this is kinda the approach that
I want to take to everything I do.

97
00:04:29.382 --> 00:04:33.303
If I can't get where I want to go
immediately, then that's like something

98
00:04:33.303 --> 00:04:36.553
I want to fix, especially when I
do it hundreds of times a day.

99
00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:40.489
The amount of times I go from editor to
window to editor to window to editor to

100
00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:40.994
window.

101
00:04:40.994 --> 00:04:44.776
I want that to be fast.

102
00:04:44.776 --> 00:04:48.489
There's a good case to be made where maybe
that's where you actually want to be able

103
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:49.882
to have the whole split thing.

104
00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:51.049
You can do that too.

105
00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:55.693
I just typically don't do that,
I like that approach.

106
00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:57.283
I don't know why, just feels good for me.

107
00:04:57.283 --> 00:04:58.907
Maybe it's my StarCraft upbringing.

108
00:04:58.907 --> 00:05:01.041
In Starcraft,
you have all these different groups.

109
00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:03.313
And so I kinda have my different
groups for how I want to play and

110
00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:04.199
how I want to position.

111
00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.772
So you gotta have your sneaking
in the back of the minerals,

112
00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:07.962
doing drops on people one.

113
00:05:07.962 --> 00:05:11.696
Then you have also your main army, and
then you also have your high Templar one,

114
00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:13.777
you gotta play your different moves there.

115
00:05:13.777 --> 00:05:15.939
So that's the life I lived.

116
00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.541
All right, so
what is a minute window manager?

117
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:19.473
There's a bunch of them.

118
00:05:19.473 --> 00:05:23.503
Usually, they just simply
organize where your windows are.

119
00:05:23.503 --> 00:05:27.943
I3 kinda wipes out your desktop, so it has
a lot more of a say over your operating

120
00:05:27.943 --> 00:05:31.605
system than, say, other window
managers like Goodbye for Mac.

121
00:05:31.605 --> 00:05:32.992
But there's a whole bunch of them, right?

122
00:05:32.992 --> 00:05:35.709
Pop OS has its own,
I forgot what it's called.

123
00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:37.712
I3, awesome window manager.

124
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.879
Left window manager, DWM.

125
00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.585
There's one that has BSPWM,
or something like that.

126
00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:47.552
There's an absolute mega amount of them.

127
00:05:47.552 --> 00:05:48.898
For me, how I use it?

128
00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:50.651
I only just want one thing, right?

129
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:54.006
So for me, there's not really
a big difference between them,

130
00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:55.980
long as I can just go where I wanna go.

131
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.685
So I don't really care.

132
00:05:57.685 --> 00:06:01.899
I don't care beyond that and
you'll notice here that I'm not giving you

133
00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:06.201
really any recommendations,
because I don't think they're that big.

134
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:08.871
I don't spend a lot of time
with a bunch of windows,

135
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.804
constantly reorganizing windows.

136
00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:14.896
I kinda have one thing that's open and
I don't change it again until I turn

137
00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:19.054
off my computer, then I return on my
computer, and then I have to regroup,

138
00:06:19.054 --> 00:06:21.892
go to each window and
be I want chrome on number two or

139
00:06:21.892 --> 00:06:24.874
Firefox at number two and
do that and then that's it.

140
00:06:24.874 --> 00:06:28.638
All right, so there you go,
I think that's it.

141
00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:31.789
You can also have program opener so
if you're on Mac, you have magic finder.

142
00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.798
If you're not on Mac,
you can get something like rofi or

143
00:06:34.798 --> 00:06:38.715
dmenu that will open up and have
effectively the exact same experience.

144
00:06:38.715 --> 00:06:40.855
It's a good move,
you should definitely have that, and

145
00:06:40.855 --> 00:06:43.679
I'm sure there's 100 more of them,
because it's Linux, after all.

146
00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:47.946
And everybody reinvents, I'm literally
telling you to reinvent the wheel also.

147
00:06:47.946 --> 00:06:51.226
So if you invent your own,
is it the worst thing?

148
00:06:51.226 --> 00:06:52.455
Probably not, but I don't know.

149
00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:54.405
For me,
that's not something I want to reinvent.

150
00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:57.962
So it feels a pretty small
surface area solve problem.

151
00:06:57.962 --> 00:06:59.787
I don't give any recs,
because I just don't.

152
00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:01.221
For me, it just doesn't matter.

153
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:05.776
I don't see how awesome window manager
is gonna make my life any better, or

154
00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:10.714
left window manager, or DWM, none of those
are gonna make any of my life better.

155
00:07:10.714 --> 00:07:12.689
So I just don't care.

156
00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:15.489
So therefore,
figure out what you like use it.

157
00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:16.379
I don't really care what it is.

158
00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:18.830
And I don't think you should
care that deeply about it,

159
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.925
unless if you want to drive a lot of
stuff through your window manager.

160
00:07:21.925 --> 00:07:24.535
And with I3 you can do that,
I could end up making it so

161
00:07:24.535 --> 00:07:28.363
that I can have a bunch of special key
combos that could change a bunch of stuff,

162
00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:32.075
or send out messages up to a server that
could say, send it down to my OBS stuff

163
00:07:32.075 --> 00:07:35.979
live, and be able to change scenes like I
could do all of that and set that all up.

164
00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:41.667
I just haven't and so maybe then I'd want
to explore a more robust Window manager,

165
00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:44.524
but until then, this is perfectly fine.

166
00:07:44.524 --> 00:07:45.096
So there you go.

167
00:07:45.096 --> 00:07:45.683
That one's done.

168
00:07:45.683 --> 00:07:47.201
I just wanted to get that in your head.

169
00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:48.192
Go fast, okay?

170
00:07:48.192 --> 00:07:51.879
So the terminal experience, which is
what I think is probably the most common

171
00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:55.566
experience, the thing that we're gonna
be using a huge portion of our time as

172
00:07:55.566 --> 00:07:58.084
developers, you often will
have a server running.

173
00:07:58.084 --> 00:08:00.528
And if you're using something like
VS code, you have a server running.

174
00:08:00.528 --> 00:08:03.975
And I know a lot of people that have to
have a second terminal open that they go

175
00:08:03.975 --> 00:08:06.219
and they have all of their
terminal stuff on, and

176
00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:09.323
then they have their editor that
they do all their editor stuff on.

177
00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:12.835
So having a good terminal
experience is highly recommended.

178
00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:16.068
And so we're gonna kinda go through
what I consider to be a great

179
00:08:16.068 --> 00:08:19.911
terminal experience, which are these
six things I want sessions to last,

180
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:21.380
even if I close my terminal.

181
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.535
I should be able to close my terminal,
and it should just keep on running.

182
00:08:24.535 --> 00:08:25.862
I want multiple sessions.

183
00:08:25.862 --> 00:08:27.473
I want them to be based on directory.

184
00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:31.460
I wanna be able to have every single
directory have its own set of windows and

185
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.674
tabs and everything.

186
00:08:32.674 --> 00:08:35.877
So that way, I can have multiple projects
running if you need to have that.

187
00:08:35.877 --> 00:08:37.737
You can have multiple
things in different areas.

188
00:08:37.737 --> 00:08:41.248
I want tabs within sessions so
that kinda falls into this one,

189
00:08:41.248 --> 00:08:45.838
which is I want to be able to have say,
Vin, some servers running a little scratch

190
00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:49.572
area to be able to execute commands
in I want all of them together.

191
00:08:49.572 --> 00:08:53.975
I want to be able to navigate to
any session with a name instantly.

192
00:08:53.975 --> 00:08:56.443
I want to be able to fuzzy,
find over those sessions and

193
00:08:56.443 --> 00:08:58.494
get to where I want to
be as quick as possible.

194
00:08:58.494 --> 00:09:02.938
And I want to be able to run a script auto
magically whenever I navigate to a new

195
00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:03.569
session.

196
00:09:03.569 --> 00:09:07.679
So if I open up a new project, I want to
be able to execute a script that can set

197
00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:10.572
up that project for
me the way I like to have it set up.

198
00:09:10.572 --> 00:09:14.375
Coz there's a lot of times where you
have to run two or three things at once.

199
00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:16.332
I'm sure there's a lot of
people here that have it so

200
00:09:16.332 --> 00:09:19.458
that you have some sort of build service,
and then you also have some sort of local.

201
00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.493
Cool server that also
needs to be running and

202
00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:23.978
perhaps some other Docker
things that go off and run.

203
00:09:23.978 --> 00:09:26.368
And then you end up having five
things that you're running.

204
00:09:26.368 --> 00:09:29.142
So it's really nice if you navigate
somewhere, it's just like, and

205
00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:29.808
it's running.

206
00:09:29.808 --> 00:09:31.915
And now you just have to do your editing.

207
00:09:31.915 --> 00:09:33.682
And so that's kinda my mentality here.

208
00:09:33.682 --> 00:09:37.742
So I want to be able to have those
scripts to be unique per directory or

209
00:09:37.742 --> 00:09:39.894
have a general one that just works.

210
00:09:39.894 --> 00:09:43.003
Alright, so for this, I choose Tmux.

211
00:09:43.003 --> 00:09:47.803
There's good arguments to be
made that Wes term actually,

212
00:09:47.803 --> 00:09:53.186
is also a really good replacement for
Tmux or Zella J I just don't.

213
00:09:53.186 --> 00:09:56.156
So instead, I use just Tmux and Ghosty.

214
00:09:56.156 --> 00:09:57.743
Ghosty is pretty awesome.

215
00:09:57.743 --> 00:09:59.621
The reason, actually,
why I use ghosty, which I think.

216
00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:02.932
I think I say down, let me just make sure.

217
00:10:02.932 --> 00:10:03.876
I don't say it around here.

218
00:10:03.876 --> 00:10:04.926
Okay, maybe I say it later.

219
00:10:04.926 --> 00:10:07.249
I do say it later, but
I'll just say it now.

220
00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:10.442
I just think Mitchell Hashimoto
is really talented.

221
00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:15.240
And so I just use his stuff because I
think he's a nice guy and that's it.

222
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.013
I use stuff for super lame reasons,
if I like somebody,

223
00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:20.611
I will go out of my way to
just use the thing they make.

224
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:22.384
Coz that person's really cool.

225
00:10:22.384 --> 00:10:25.372
I'm just gonna use it coz it's super cool,
right?

226
00:10:25.372 --> 00:10:28.012
That's it and so I think Ghosty is cool.

227
00:10:28.012 --> 00:10:29.118
Coz I think Mitchell's cool.

228
00:10:29.118 --> 00:10:33.834
And so even though West term apparently
can solve both my terminal and

229
00:10:33.834 --> 00:10:38.970
my TMUX, I just keep on using Ghosty
plus TMUX coz that's just the way I am.
