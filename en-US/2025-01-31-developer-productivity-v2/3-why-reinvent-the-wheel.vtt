00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.044
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: So
I love reinventing the Wheel.

2
00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:03.940
It's my favorite pastime.

3
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.709
Every single day of my life,

4
00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:11.037
if I can spend five to 10 to 20 minutes
reinventing some wheel, it makes me happy.

5
00:00:11.037 --> 00:00:14.594
A lot of it just comes down to just
appreciating what it takes to make

6
00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:15.237
software.

7
00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:18.721
Every now and then you see this a lot,
especially with like younger or

8
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.356
newer folks into the industry.

9
00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:22.939
Is they'll be like,
why can't they just do this, all right?

10
00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.569
And their head software simple, still.

11
00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.966
It still has this veneer that it's
everything is accomplishable,

12
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.574
very easy and very quick, and so

13
00:00:29.574 --> 00:00:33.460
you just don't have that fundamental
appreciation of how difficult it was.

14
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.846
It sounds so easy in principle and
in reality, it should be simple.

15
00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:38.261
You have a bit of memory.

16
00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:39.401
You need to display it.

17
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:40.339
That's all it should be.

18
00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.151
But we've convinced ourselves to
wrap everything in configuration and

19
00:00:43.151 --> 00:00:45.594
abstractions that it makes things
actually really hard to do,

20
00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:46.666
which should seem simple.

21
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:50.462
So I think to the layman person,
things feel like they should be easy and

22
00:00:50.462 --> 00:00:51.935
often they're very hard.

23
00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:55.279
So reinventing the wheel helps cure you
of that sickness over, and over, and

24
00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.852
over again.

25
00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:57.824
So I highly recommend that you do that.

26
00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.096
And you also learn a lot about
the topic along the way, right?

27
00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:03.885
Whatever you're reinventing, you will
learn more about you will become more of

28
00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:07.505
an expert on it, and those really kind of
hazy boxes that you have drawn in your

29
00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:11.594
head will become much more concrete, and
you'll understand what's inside of them.

30
00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:15.304
And you'll also become a better engineer,
because you'll be able to gauge what it

31
00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:18.908
takes to build something more and more
accurately, because I think that you'll

32
00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:22.149
start seeing all these weird corner
cases that will inevitably come up.

33
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.893
And it's easier for you to have that in
your head loaded up because you've already

34
00:01:25.893 --> 00:01:27.041
solved a bunch of stuff.

35
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:33.108
Like a really great exercise is
building HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 from TCP.

36
00:01:33.108 --> 00:01:34.776
Not hard.

37
00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:38.341
Most of it's really, really simple, but
then you'll realize that there's like,

38
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:40.815
900 edge cases, and
that's where for all the time, and

39
00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:43.559
that's what makes making that
HTTP server really complicated.

40
00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:46.886
And you realize,
this is why all this stuff is complicated,

41
00:01:46.886 --> 00:01:50.273
just getting the message is simple,
but we have all this legacy and

42
00:01:50.273 --> 00:01:53.562
crap in the way that makes us have
to do all these strange things.

43
00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:55.062
And now look at where we're at, and

44
00:01:55.062 --> 00:01:57.421
then you just gain a whole
new appreciation for things.

45
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:59.523
All right, so my current bash setup,

46
00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:03.005
this is obviously subject to change
about once a year to twice or

47
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:07.160
once every two years, I try to rethink or
readjust or make my stuff better.

48
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.401
I never again want to be that meme of
the continual pursuit of perfection.

49
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:13.480
I don't have to have things be perfect.

50
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.842
I don't really care if things are perfect.

51
00:02:14.842 --> 00:02:16.534
I just want them good enough.

52
00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:20.272
And I want them to just take
care of the 98% of problems.

53
00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:22.199
Is I'm fine doing things manually.

54
00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.618
If it's rare,
I try never to automate the rarities.

55
00:02:25.618 --> 00:02:27.404
I try to automate the everyday.

56
00:02:27.404 --> 00:02:30.218
When I want to go to my editor,
I want that to be fast.

57
00:02:30.218 --> 00:02:33.412
When I want to go back to my browser,
I want that to be fast.

58
00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:37.702
I don't want those little things to be
fast that are just that just take way too

59
00:02:37.702 --> 00:02:40.477
much effort and
give you very little of anything.

60
00:02:40.477 --> 00:02:41.884
All right, so we're gonna set some goals.

61
00:02:41.884 --> 00:02:45.382
I wanna be able to bootstrap my machine
that I'll purchase in the future that is

62
00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:46.077
Ubuntu based.

63
00:02:46.077 --> 00:02:48.573
Now you guys can make it Mac based or
Windows based.

64
00:02:48.573 --> 00:02:50.486
I'm not sure what Windows uses, any files.

65
00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:52.175
I don't know how they work
over their PowerShell.

66
00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:55.796
I hear PowerShell a lot, and so
I'm not gonna even try to be clever.

67
00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:57.385
Not gonna try to do multi OS style.

68
00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:59.446
But it's not hard when it comes to bash,
right?

69
00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:03.246
You just Have two scripts, one that does
brew install, one does a bash install.

70
00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:06.209
You don't have to abstract it
into some sort of abstract

71
00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.606
installer that does platform independent,

72
00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:11.831
you're just reinventing Ansible
if you go down that route.

73
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:12.937
Just keep things simple.

74
00:03:12.937 --> 00:03:15.867
If I need a Mac install script, I'm
just gonna create a Mac install version.

75
00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:19.339
I just don't use Mac right now and I'm
gonna keep on going as long as I can until

76
00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.563
I'm forced to use some other operating
system at some point in my life.

77
00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:24.386
I wanna be able to install
my favorite libraries.

78
00:03:24.386 --> 00:03:28.136
I want to bring down repos that I
actively maintain because there's just

79
00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:31.960
a set of repos that I prefer to just
have locally right away on any machine.

80
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.273
I want to be able to build NeoVim
from source, I love NeoVim.

81
00:03:35.273 --> 00:03:37.821
I wanna be able to use all
the tools that I just like.

82
00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:39.759
I want them available and I wanna copy.

83
00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.330
My .files over to my environment.

84
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.349
I like them separated.

85
00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.066
I no longer like to use
symlinks to my dot files.

86
00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:52.914
I just like the process of this
is where I'm going to edit it.

87
00:03:52.914 --> 00:03:54.694
So when I go there,
I intentionally edit it.

88
00:03:54.694 --> 00:03:55.677
I can make sure I commit it.

89
00:03:55.677 --> 00:03:57.557
I can make sure everything's up to date.

90
00:03:57.557 --> 00:03:59.653
And then I can make sure
everything's copied over and

91
00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:00.957
everything's good cuz or else,

92
00:04:00.957 --> 00:04:04.373
whenever it's really loosey-goosey like
that, I tend to forget the little things.

93
00:04:04.373 --> 00:04:05.913
I don't navigate to a directory.

94
00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:07.316
I don't have all those things set up.

95
00:04:07.316 --> 00:04:09.083
And then, boom,
I forgot I made all these updates.

96
00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.737
And then the updates
become kind of out there.

97
00:04:11.737 --> 00:04:15.964
Or even worse, I create a little file
that I need somewhere on my system.

98
00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.636
And it's not a part of
the symlink category group.

99
00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:20.633
And it just never makes it
into Into my dot files,

100
00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:22.690
because I don't have that
kind of habit built in.

101
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.065
So I just prefer the copy approach.

102
00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:27.294
I just think it's the best that's just me.

103
00:04:27.294 --> 00:04:29.287
I'm gonna keep on doing it.

104
00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:30.070
That's that.

105
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.427
I just really just want it all.

106
00:04:31.427 --> 00:04:34.970
I just want to be able to automate my
system the greatest automation language of

107
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.297
all time, which, of course, is bash,
the greatest language ever, and

108
00:04:38.297 --> 00:04:39.169
rolling your own.

109
00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.568
There's actually kind of some other
versions of this project out there.

110
00:04:42.568 --> 00:04:45.355
I've seen like dot bots,
like one that it's similar, but

111
00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:48.610
it's meant to be very generalized so
that everybody can have there.

112
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.014
So a lot, again,
a lot of configuration over convention.

113
00:04:52.014 --> 00:04:54.017
Just not for me.

114
00:04:54.017 --> 00:04:56.506
Second, I think there's
Yadam is another one.

115
00:04:56.506 --> 00:04:58.381
Again, a lot more configuration.

116
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.383
It's meant to be the general solution.

117
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:04.341
I'm not trying to make a general solution
here, I'm trying to make a solution that I

118
00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:07.258
like, that I can hack on,
that I can be exactly the way I want.

119
00:05:07.258 --> 00:05:09.879
And I'm also not foolish.

120
00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.869
Anytime you build something just for
yourself, it's also up to you to maintain.

121
00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:14.809
So don't forget that.

122
00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:17.129
You gotta judge what is
worthy of your time, and

123
00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.493
whatever you think is worthy of your time,
make sure you do it well and

124
00:05:20.493 --> 00:05:22.932
do it great and
make it exactly the way you want it.

125
00:05:22.932 --> 00:05:25.067
And the things that aren't worthy
of your time, don't do it.

126
00:05:25.067 --> 00:05:29.003
There's an excellent article,
his name's I think it is.

127
00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:32.313
If you've heard of his name,
I think that's what it is.

128
00:05:32.313 --> 00:05:35.486
He has kind of like a theory about
when should businesses write

129
00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:38.851
software themselves as opposed
to using libraries and all that.

130
00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:41.900
And his whole argument comes It comes
down to if it's business critical,

131
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.763
you should write your own,
even if there's already one available.

132
00:05:44.763 --> 00:05:47.239
If it's what you do,
that's the thing you write.

133
00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:49.213
And so for me,
the thing I do is I develop.

134
00:05:49.213 --> 00:05:50.890
So I write my own environment.

135
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.519
I feel like that's the business
critical use case for me.

136
00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.048
It's just a approach I
like to make right now.

137
00:05:56.048 --> 00:05:58.216
And maybe one day I'll change that.

138
00:05:58.216 --> 00:05:59.563
And question.

139
00:05:59.563 --> 00:06:03.659
&gt;&gt; Student: I just wanna add that in front
of master's case, it's our courses player,

140
00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.009
it's the environment.

141
00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.839
So we wrote all of that from scratch.

142
00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:08.185
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: Yeah,
I think that's the way to go.

143
00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:11.841
I personally think that you always build
your own Mote by having it exactly the way

144
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:12.445
you want it.

145
00:06:12.445 --> 00:06:13.939
&gt;&gt; Student: Every time we
go back to the software,

146
00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.676
there's not like dependencies to update.

147
00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:18.522
It's just like you just add the feature.

148
00:06:18.522 --> 00:06:19.492
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: It's true.
