00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.134
For me, making my experience and
everything better makes me happy,

2
00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:04.112
that's what I like.

3
00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:07.717
I like to find out new ways to be able
to program, to make things better.

4
00:00:07.717 --> 00:00:11.179
I like trying out new languages cuz
it changes the way I look at things.

5
00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.965
Oddly enough, I know this is gonna
sound completely just insane, but

6
00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:20.601
I actually had a ton of fun learning
how to program emojilang, yes.

7
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:24.786
I learned how to program emojilang,
I know what this file actually does.

8
00:00:24.786 --> 00:00:28.791
And there's actually super cool concepts
specifically in emojilang that you just

9
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:30.341
wouldn't get somewhere else.

10
00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:34.000
I know that sounds completely, it just
sound a little crazy, but honestly,

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.342
it's really interesting look that
emojilang even asked right here.

12
00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:42.044
That's lion stands for sort, sort
collection left with closure that takes a,

13
00:00:42.044 --> 00:00:46.676
b, a-b, look at that, that's just
like your Javascript.sort with a- b,

14
00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:48.162
the same thing, right?

15
00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:50.307
I just love this kind of
perspective of it, and

16
00:00:50.307 --> 00:00:53.780
it has this slightly unique perspective
about optionals and air objects.

17
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.327
And it was just fun, it's fun,
I just enjoy doing the dumb things,

18
00:00:57.327 --> 00:01:01.703
cuz I like to learn about things, and even
when it provides me absolutely nothing.

19
00:01:01.703 --> 00:01:05.139
It's still something for me to look at and
see a new way to solve problems,

20
00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:07.757
and it's just like the joy of
it is the reason why I do it.

21
00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:09.663
It's not just simply to get a task done.

22
00:01:09.663 --> 00:01:13.576
I think that's a very important
difference, getting tests done, obviously,

23
00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:16.121
very important,
that's why I optimize to be fast.

24
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:20.615
But the whole point is not simply to be
at the end, it's to both do the walk and

25
00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:21.541
get to the end.

26
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:24.631
And I will never say, you'll never hear
me say, the journey is better than

27
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:27.001
the destination,
cuz that's a horrible life outlook.

28
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.352
Let me just correct it right now,
the journey can be important, but

29
00:01:29.352 --> 00:01:32.321
it's not as good as the destination, cuz
that means you're always going downhill,

30
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:33.163
don't live that life.

31
00:01:33.163 --> 00:01:35.994
The destination has to, in fact,
be better than the journey, or

32
00:01:35.994 --> 00:01:39.247
else you will always have nothing to
look forward to, don't forget that.

33
00:01:39.247 --> 00:01:41.427
Don't let anyone be
bamboozle you on that one.

34
00:01:41.427 --> 00:01:44.147
All right, an important note,
the most important thing about this course

35
00:01:44.147 --> 00:01:45.972
is not to do what I do, but
to do what you want to do.

36
00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:50.266
You saw how I approached it, hopefully you
went, hey, I could change it like this,

37
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:53.734
or, hey, I would much rather do
it this completely different way.

38
00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:56.752
Hopefully I just gave you the keys to go,
I can do anything.

39
00:01:56.752 --> 00:01:59.914
That's really the goal of the course,
is to show that

40
00:01:59.914 --> 00:02:04.554
your dev setup is better than mine because
it's for you, it's not for me, and

41
00:02:04.554 --> 00:02:08.451
just like mine is better than
yours because it's for me, right?

42
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:10.854
That's why I intentionally
titled it this way.

43
00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:15.078
Is because that's how I think, is that
mine is better because it's been built

44
00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:17.259
only for me, I didn't think about you.

45
00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.688
I'm sorry, Dapper,
I didn't think about you, buddy.

46
00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:24.502
This is just what I built it for,
I built it for me, and that's it.

47
00:02:24.502 --> 00:02:27.093
And that is, in fact,
the end of this course.

48
00:02:27.093 --> 00:02:30.668
&gt;&gt; Students: [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; ThePrime agen: The end.

49
00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:34.381
