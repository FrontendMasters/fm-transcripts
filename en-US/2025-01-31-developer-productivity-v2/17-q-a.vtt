WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.917
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Going back to the first
thing you were talking about Ansible

2
00:00:02.917 --> 00:00:04.033
versus Bash scripts.

3
00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.814
One of the reasons that I've been
doing Ansible or using that is for

4
00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:08.016
the item potency part of it.

5
00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:09.343
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: Yeah.

6
00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Have you handled that at
all in the bash stuff that you've done?

7
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.614
Or is it just like, yeah,
run it it'll be fine.

8
00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:17.225
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: Yeah, so
a couple things there.

9
00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:20.349
One thing is if you remove, obviously,
something from your Ansible script and

10
00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.927
you rerun your Ansible script,
it won't know about that thing.

11
00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:24.050
So that thing will continue to live.

12
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.232
So it's like,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: [LAUGH]

13
00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:26.016
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: Most certainly

14
00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:30.414
the idempotency is like an important part,
but it's also there's some lies around it

15
00:00:30.414 --> 00:00:33.559
is that it doesn't always stay
up to date with what you think.

16
00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.357
Second, that's why I like the remove and
then copy kind of plan,

17
00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:39.646
because that's very Ansible-like.

18
00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:44.009
You'll notice I kind of stole that
same ideas, I want to do that.

19
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.023
So it's partially there.

20
00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:49.546
It's never gonna be there but
nothing I do is that complicated.

21
00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:53.959
I can reinstall,
I can re-pseudo apt install JQ 1000 times.

22
00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:58.376
I'm not gaining new versions of JQ
over and over again on my system.

23
00:00:58.376 --> 00:01:00.270
Apt is smart enough to handle that for me.

24
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.011
So I just kind of like
gave that part up and

25
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:05.200
realized I don't think that part
really matters for my personal system.

26
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.451
If there is something that,
every time I execute it,

27
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:10.902
it adds one to a list somewhere on my
system, and that's forever getting bigger,

28
00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:12.369
hopefully I would discover that.

29
00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.230
And then I can write an if statement for
that one thing.

30
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.763
You minimally, if you're using,
what's it called?

31
00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:19.727
If you're using that, you gotta admit.

32
00:01:19.727 --> 00:01:21.769
I like that's pretty sweet.

33
00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:25.249
Right, if you're using Ansible and I just
like update and just execute that fast,

34
00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.352
you're like, dang, that is, I like that.

35
00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:28.002
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I'm tempted.

36
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.492
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: Yeah,
this is the whole driving factor for

37
00:01:30.492 --> 00:01:34.448
me too was to develop this entire
thing was cuz of Ansible slowness.

38
00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:35.451
Cuz I didn't want to do that.

39
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:37.890
I really try to use tools first and

40
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.786
when they can't conform to what I want,
then I try to build my own.

41
00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:47.946
And so
this is me building my replacement, Mark?

42
00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:53.757
&gt;&gt; Mark: How do you keep your dot file
repo updated with local config changes,

43
00:01:53.757 --> 00:01:56.774
since you don't use stow anymore?

44
00:01:56.774 --> 00:01:59.581
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: So that's why,
if you notice that, it's always copy over.

45
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:03.704
And I'm always in the habit to edit
my dev folder, not just the thing.

46
00:02:03.704 --> 00:02:06.296
So you did see me here for
a brief second to get the little typing,

47
00:02:06.296 --> 00:02:07.988
these little typing symbols right here.

48
00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:11.346
As I type, I went like this and
edited the live version.

49
00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:14.100
That means the moment I push this,
it's gonna just replace it,

50
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.076
which it already did.

51
00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:18.271
So if I were to rerun this, my
keystrokes will no longer be right here.

52
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.674
It's just running right now.

53
00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:23.173
Cuz I didn't wanna edit the actual file
cuz it works for me when I'm at home.

54
00:02:23.173 --> 00:02:28.442
And so that's kind of my approach
is that I've just built in a habit.

55
00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:30.461
I have a convention over a configuration.

56
00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:35.288
So when I want to edit something for my
personal system, I go to my dev folder and

57
00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.717
then I do my edit and then I push all out.

58
00:02:37.717 --> 00:02:41.720
Look, I still even have
my previous play books.

59
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.908
See, I told you I was
really building Lula here.

60
00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:47.361
I still have them all right there and
so I just edit it there, and

61
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:48.672
then I go dev n, right?

62
00:02:48.672 --> 00:02:53.240
And then that will go delete
everything and re-add everything and so

63
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.536
I just keep on doing that process.

64
00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:59.561
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: The major tools that we
talked about, like Bash, Vim, and t-mux.

65
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.424
What was your progression for
how you adopted them?

66
00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:06.106
Was it you kind of went on a deep dive and
learned them all and to for this setup

67
00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:10.023
like this, or you kind of picked them up
along the way throughout your career and

68
00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.210
pieced them together?

69
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.951
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: Yeah, so in 2012,
I picked up vim motions and IntelliJ.

70
00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:18.383
I thought vim was for old, stupid people.

71
00:03:18.383 --> 00:03:20.880
Honestly, I had that very kind of,

72
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.295
a churlish a mindset of young kids
when they're 22 and they're just like,

73
00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:30.984
yeah, Vim's for stupid old people,
why would you wanna do this?

74
00:03:30.984 --> 00:03:35.958
So that was my mentality in 2012 and then
I did Vim motions, and I was just like,

75
00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.179
hey, hey, man, I love Starcraft.

76
00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.371
I love this too and so it's just
like I started getting into that and

77
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:43.834
then I remember I was just
really fast at using Vim.

78
00:03:43.834 --> 00:03:44.930
It just spoke to my heart.

79
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.054
It was just the thing I really, really
liked and so I could definitely do this.

80
00:03:48.054 --> 00:03:53.988
I really enjoy this and then in 2000 and
some time, 2015 I had a co-worker named

81
00:03:53.988 --> 00:03:59.138
Yunong, and he joined old joint engineer
worked on Node way back in the day.

82
00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:02.291
Then he just it's kinda helped me around,
playing around with my Vim RC.

83
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:04.156
So I just started using
Vim instead of IntelliJ.

84
00:04:04.156 --> 00:04:05.253
I was like, it was really fun.

85
00:04:05.253 --> 00:04:07.793
Started using that, kind of explored
around, eventually, kind of gave up,

86
00:04:07.793 --> 00:04:09.451
went back to IntelliJ but
I just used it for a while.

87
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:13.696
Then I watched a co worker named Anders
back, and he's really, really good at C++.

88
00:04:13.696 --> 00:04:17.393
And a guy named Guy Serino,
he has some guy, nice try, guy.

89
00:04:17.393 --> 00:04:22.029
That guy, they just both were so fast and
they're just environment would switch all

90
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.159
over the place that I just watched and
went, okay, I'm gonna learn this.

91
00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.762
That's what I want.

92
00:04:26.762 --> 00:04:27.964
I want their editing speed.

93
00:04:27.964 --> 00:04:30.380
Because when I went over to Anders side,
I said, hey,

94
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.178
there's a bug in this version of TV why?

95
00:04:32.178 --> 00:04:32.843
And he's working on something.

96
00:04:32.843 --> 00:04:35.553
He's like, hold on, swap over.

97
00:04:35.553 --> 00:04:36.570
Checked out a new version.

98
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.668
Did this, this, I was just like,
that was the fastest thing I've ever seen.

99
00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:40.595
How did he do that?

100
00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:42.427
Now, I understand all the things he did.

101
00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:43.715
He does it through Emacs.

102
00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:46.546
So I will say he's a sinner but
we'll get there,

103
00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:49.249
maybe one day we'll bring
him over to new Vim.

104
00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:52.175
But nonetheless, he was so
very, very fast, and

105
00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:56.225
it just kind of impressed upon me
that I've been living in 1999.

106
00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:57.845
I wanna live in 2077 right?

107
00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:00.832
I wanna be way out there with
all the speed and everything and

108
00:05:00.832 --> 00:05:03.723
I wanna be the fastest possible
coolest way to do things.

109
00:05:03.723 --> 00:05:05.682
And so I'm like why am I not doing that.

110
00:05:05.682 --> 00:05:07.861
And so
then that kind of just stuck it in me so

111
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:10.053
in about 2016 was that that happened.

112
00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:12.855
So I went i3 and
then t-max came a little bit later and

113
00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:16.480
then just kept adding things over
the course of the last eight years.

114
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.904
&gt;&gt; Mark: How do you keep
your mullet looking so good.

115
00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.152
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: That's a great question.

116
00:05:22.152 --> 00:05:23.592
So I use my wife's shampoo.

117
00:05:23.592 --> 00:05:26.428
She spends a lot more on
shampoo than I do and so

118
00:05:26.428 --> 00:05:29.124
I would use Gurney a fruittease normally.

119
00:05:29.124 --> 00:05:31.783
Second, obviously,
I'd like to thank my mom's dad.

120
00:05:31.783 --> 00:05:33.245
Thanks for having all that hair.

121
00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:37.716
Mom's dad, cuz I am in my upper 30s and
still mostly half hair, so

122
00:05:37.716 --> 00:05:39.765
I'm pretty happy about that.

123
00:05:39.765 --> 00:05:42.838
And then lastly, obviously,
I would just say just adopting

124
00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:45.921
the lifestyle of a mullet makes
your mullet more beautiful.

125
00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:49.507
So I've been really thinking about
drinking a lot more Miller Lite these

126
00:05:49.507 --> 00:05:53.698
days shooting, shotguns off the back of
ATVs, just really living that lifestyle.

127
00:05:53.698 --> 00:05:56.579
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Obviously this is
a lot of like your own what you do,

128
00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:59.259
yeah your setup is but
the kind of fast shut up and

129
00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.550
just doing all those things
that's kind of the skeleton.

130
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.138
You can throw in whatever you
actually want in there right.

131
00:06:05.138 --> 00:06:07.193
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: Correct.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It doesn't have to lead you

132
00:06:07.193 --> 00:06:09.107
towards the dark path of Vim.

133
00:06:09.107 --> 00:06:11.272
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: It doesn't have to
lead you towards the dark path of Vim.

134
00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:14.706
And I think more importantly
what it should lead you towards

135
00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:19.308
is the desire to do something to take away
all the annoyances of your day whatever

136
00:06:19.308 --> 00:06:20.352
that looks like.

137
00:06:20.352 --> 00:06:23.344
And then you have to be willing to do
something that's counterintuitive.

138
00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:26.333
When I learned Vim,
I thought it was counterintuitive,

139
00:06:26.333 --> 00:06:29.459
as I specifically said for
old, dumb dudes from the 70s.

140
00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:30.776
I didn't wanna hang out with those guys.

141
00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:33.087
I was like, those kind of stupid
other command line tools,

142
00:06:33.087 --> 00:06:34.347
and then all sudden, I used it.

143
00:06:34.347 --> 00:06:36.065
I'm like, okay, I was wrong.

144
00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:38.173
I was the bad guy in this situation.

145
00:06:38.173 --> 00:06:39.152
The call came from the house.

146
00:06:39.152 --> 00:06:41.117
The killer's in the house and
the killer's me, right?

147
00:06:41.117 --> 00:06:43.397
I was just realized that I was
the wrong one in this situation.

148
00:06:43.397 --> 00:06:46.688
So things that are counterintuitive
at first are harder to adopt, but

149
00:06:46.688 --> 00:06:49.272
then when you do it,
you realize how much better it is.

150
00:06:49.272 --> 00:06:52.194
One of the best examples,
I think, is that what?

151
00:06:52.194 --> 00:06:55.880
Every single professional golf
player holds golf thing like

152
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.802
this with crossed fingers in this very
specific way you're supposed to hold it.

153
00:07:00.802 --> 00:07:03.558
I think there might be one or
two that don't, but

154
00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:05.653
naturally I would hold it like that.

155
00:07:05.653 --> 00:07:07.604
I'd get ready to try to smash it.

156
00:07:07.604 --> 00:07:10.420
It's like, no, you gotta do all these
weird things with your body and

157
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.094
they're all counterintuitive,
but then when you get good at it,

158
00:07:13.094 --> 00:07:15.415
you'll be much better than
the person who never does it.

159
00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:18.159
But that's only if you
want to get to that level.

160
00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.459
Do you just want to hold it
like a baseball bat and swing?

161
00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:22.035
Some people just wanna get that good and

162
00:07:22.035 --> 00:07:24.583
they can get to a certain point
of goodness, and that's okay.

163
00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:26.824
And maybe that's what you're
okay with shooting for.

164
00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:28.050
I was never okay with that.

165
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.646
So for development, I was ready to
hold my head, still do all the things,

166
00:07:31.646 --> 00:07:35.019
get a trainer, put stuff on my feet
to hold the golf club, all weird.

167
00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:37.748
And then now I'm using Vim and
all these things, right?

168
00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:41.196
So it's like I was willing to make
that leap cuz I wanted to get to

169
00:07:41.196 --> 00:07:42.380
the professionals.

170
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.798
I didn't wanna just keep swirling around
in what felt comfortable without ever

171
00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:46.469
leaving that.

172
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:49.314
And I do also, one more thing,
I know, there's another question.

173
00:07:49.314 --> 00:07:53.164
It's hyper important to always
challenge your comfort zone.

174
00:07:53.164 --> 00:07:54.887
Whatever that is,
doesn't matter what it is.

175
00:07:54.887 --> 00:07:58.044
In programming, you always want to push
yourself into something you don't know,

176
00:07:58.044 --> 00:07:59.547
at least for some small amount of time.

177
00:07:59.547 --> 00:08:01.987
I have a personal theory,
this personal theory,

178
00:08:01.987 --> 00:08:05.075
that most burnout happens because
you never see anything new.

179
00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:06.129
It's just like, you wake up,

180
00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:08.931
you go to your job, you do the thing, you
already know the thing you're gonna do,

181
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:10.696
the thing's already been planned for
two months.

182
00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:12.909
And in two more months, you already
know what you're gonna be doing,

183
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:13.996
you already know all the answers,

184
00:08:13.996 --> 00:08:16.491
it's just a matter of you mashing in
the keys, you're hyper-unmotivated.

185
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:21.011
So your work goes by at like a snail's
pace, and it's just like every single day.

186
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:22.411
Of course, you'd be burnt out.

187
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:25.698
And so for me, I have to after work or
in my spare time,

188
00:08:25.698 --> 00:08:30.158
do things that I think are cool or
exciting, build things I didn't think

189
00:08:30.158 --> 00:08:34.197
I could build, because for me,
that makes the rest of life good.

190
00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:38.628
It's if I can't find a time to enjoy it
for what it is, then I can't enjoy it for

191
00:08:38.628 --> 00:08:41.932
when I have to eat meat and
potatoes or eat the plain stuff.

192
00:08:41.932 --> 00:08:47.565
So that's personal mentality there,
all right, Mark?

193
00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:51.390
&gt;&gt; Mark: Two new questions came in
around the happiness of a team,

194
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:56.024
and kind of applying these principles
to working with other people.

195
00:08:56.024 --> 00:09:02.922
Have you found any sort of tips in your
time working with teams at Netflix or

196
00:09:02.922 --> 00:09:09.283
wherever applying these principles
to working with other people?

197
00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:12.707
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: Yeah I've been through
quite a few different teams because

198
00:09:12.707 --> 00:09:14.632
I spent over a decade at Netflix.

199
00:09:14.632 --> 00:09:16.270
I've been on many different teams and

200
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.303
many different teams have totally
different operating procedures.

201
00:09:19.303 --> 00:09:21.796
Some people want to get together and
have a style guide.

202
00:09:21.796 --> 00:09:25.925
They want to have required testing,
whether it's integration,

203
00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:27.482
whatever it is, right?

204
00:09:27.482 --> 00:09:28.951
And some people want none of that.

205
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:31.165
And so obviously you have to
play the team you're on, and

206
00:09:31.165 --> 00:09:34.132
every team is slightly different than
the other team you're going to be on.

207
00:09:34.132 --> 00:09:40.793
And so personally, what I find is that,
I never try to die on bad hills.

208
00:09:40.793 --> 00:09:43.637
I find that that to be the best
way to create a good team.

209
00:09:43.637 --> 00:09:46.647
Is that if someone uploads something or
creates a PR with a style,

210
00:09:46.647 --> 00:09:49.893
I don't like a naming convention,
I don't like any of those things.

211
00:09:49.893 --> 00:09:51.781
I never say any crap thing about that,

212
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:55.203
because I just think that that is
just a great way to build animosity.

213
00:09:55.203 --> 00:09:58.504
I can think of people specifically
that I never want to work with,

214
00:09:58.504 --> 00:10:00.978
cuz it's just like every kill,
you will die on.

215
00:10:00.978 --> 00:10:03.250
So it's like, some are important,
some aren't important.

216
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.214
Now, when an important one comes up,
I'm gonna be willing to push against you,

217
00:10:07.214 --> 00:10:10.442
cuz I think that everything you
say is just nonsense versus this.

218
00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:14.067
So for me, all about creating team
cohesion or collaboration, right?

219
00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:17.171
So it's like, yeah,
you'd like to do it your way, it's fine.

220
00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:20.504
If we have a style guide, everyone has
to have the same looking-ish code, so

221
00:10:20.504 --> 00:10:22.935
I don't care if you wanna do
it this way versus that way.

222
00:10:22.935 --> 00:10:24.496
Some people like currying and lambdas and

223
00:10:24.496 --> 00:10:27.450
other people don't wanna do any of that
and they want it this way with classes.

224
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.006
It's just I'm not gonna argue over the
fine details because at the end of the day

225
00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:33.231
none of them matter.

226
00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:35.338
And so, that's my team approach.

227
00:10:35.338 --> 00:10:38.592
It's just only fight for
the things that make sense and

228
00:10:38.592 --> 00:10:40.933
just let people do the thing they want.

229
00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:43.863
I don't have nearly
the same approach to teams.

230
00:10:43.863 --> 00:10:47.824
I think most software can be written, and
most software's complete crap anyways,

231
00:10:47.824 --> 00:10:50.910
just due to time constraints and
not knowing what's happening.

232
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.161
And also just longevity of it being,
you build something over two years.

233
00:10:55.161 --> 00:10:59.064
The first six months are just chaos
compared to the last six months,

234
00:10:59.064 --> 00:11:02.364
you're just like, Man,
I wish those ones were better.

235
00:11:02.364 --> 00:11:05.299
So it's just like, yeah, I'm sure there
does exist a world in which we could make

236
00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:08.301
a perfect team, where everyone's happy and
everyone works on meaningful stuff.

237
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:12.550
But most of us just have to try to
fight Jenkins and make groovy work.

238
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.562
It's just like that's life.

239
00:11:13.562 --> 00:11:16.180
So I try not to be too intense about it.

240
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.489
That's my team answer, at least.
