1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.187
And so why no AI is part of this course.

2
00:00:02.187 --> 00:00:06.366
You probably noticed that I haven't
talked anything about AI thus far, which,

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.281
like developer productivity, AI.

4
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:10.291
Well, I have two reasons
why I didn't talk about it,

5
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.897
the first time I did this course,
I actually did show off co-pilot.

6
00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:15.111
This is, like the week co-pilot came out.

7
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:19.465
I also talked about it in this course
because they gave me access to

8
00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:20.501
it right away.

9
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.134
And it was a lot of fun,
it was such a cool experience using it for

10
00:00:23.134 --> 00:00:23.845
the first time.

11
00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:27.396
I still remember to this day going like,
if player one loses,

12
00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:28.910
console player one lost.

13
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.092
I'm like, and I'm like, and
then it's like, else this, I'm like,

14
00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:33.167
wow, that's a magical.

15
00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:34.739
And then I hit Enter.

16
00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.626
And it's also, else tie, and
I was like I didn't even think about that,

17
00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:41.196
I remember just thinking,
wow, that's like,

18
00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:44.477
the most magical thing I've ever
used in my entire lifetime.

19
00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:48.930
But remember, at that point in life,
there was none of that beforehand, and

20
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.287
now there's just something that's like,
spewing out,

21
00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:55.730
sometimes accurate things and
like, that was magic to me.

22
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.956
And so I have this whole theory about AI
in general right now, what's happening?

23
00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:03.336
If you listen to anyone talk right
now on the internet, just anyone,

24
00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:06.325
ask them about how do you feel
about ChatGPT4 versus cloud.

25
00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:07.248
And what will they say?

26
00:01:07.248 --> 00:01:11.852
Man, cloud is so good, ChatGPT4, it's just
ass, it's just the worst thing I've ever,

27
00:01:11.852 --> 00:01:12.763
it's just so bad.

28
00:01:12.763 --> 00:01:16.101
It's just like, dude,
two years ago, we just ChatGPT3,

29
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:18.794
and it was the craziest
thing you've ever seen.

30
00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:19.777
What's happening?

31
00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:23.517
And that's what I like to refer to as the,
what's it called?

32
00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:27.178
The inevitable decay of amazement,
which is, we had nothing.

33
00:01:27.178 --> 00:01:31.412
So GPT3 was incredible and you found
it to be the most amazing thing ever.

34
00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:34.439
If you were to use it today,
you'd say it's completely terrible, but

35
00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.709
why was it so great back then?

36
00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.577
It's cuz there was nothing else like it
beforehand, and so just felt so amaizing.

37
00:01:39.577 --> 00:01:42.448
And every release feels
slightly less amazing, and

38
00:01:42.448 --> 00:01:45.003
you feel slightly less
like captivated by it.

39
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:48.911
And now we're just arguing over these
really fine tuned differences between

40
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:51.625
cloud versus GPT4 versus
one versus whatever.

41
00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:56.188
And inevitably, when GPT5 comes out, I'm
sure it will be so much, much better, but

42
00:01:56.188 --> 00:01:58.829
it still won't have the same
level of amazement.

43
00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.718
Right here, and we'll still be
arguing which one is better all along,

44
00:02:01.718 --> 00:02:04.337
they only getting slightly actual
better on their error rates.

45
00:02:04.337 --> 00:02:05.408
There'll still be a bunch of errors.

46
00:02:05.408 --> 00:02:08.380
So, I didn't really want to talk about
it for that one reason and number two,

47
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.096
the second one is that a lot of junior
devs when they're starting out.

48
00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:14.498
They replace their
ability to learn with AI.

49
00:02:14.498 --> 00:02:18.773
If you are using AI in such a way that
you're not asking If you had to say,

50
00:02:18.773 --> 00:02:22.855
if you wanted to make a game and
you're like, hey, make me Tetris.

51
00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:24.267
You didn't learn anything, right?

52
00:02:24.267 --> 00:02:26.398
If you're like, hey,
how do I paint a square?

53
00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:28.213
You take painting a square and
you make your own block.

54
00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:30.821
I don't, I don't think AI is
bad at all for saying, hey,

55
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:34.333
show me how to make a square so I can make
whatever they call those poly he drawn,

56
00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.285
whatever I for, there's like
a certain name for Tetris things.

57
00:02:37.285 --> 00:02:38.342
I forget what they're called.

58
00:02:38.342 --> 00:02:40.700
So you can make your own, right?

59
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.532
So many people jump forward now.

60
00:02:42.532 --> 00:02:45.824
And I talk to a lot of college students
and they all are saying the same thing,

61
00:02:45.824 --> 00:02:48.088
which is I'm the only person
that doesn't use it and

62
00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:50.580
I'm always the only person
doing any of their projects.

63
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.254
Everyone is copying me on the labs now.

64
00:02:52.254 --> 00:02:55.614
Everyone's doing this, cuz if they can't
immediately get the answer from the AI,

65
00:02:55.614 --> 00:02:57.524
they don't know what
they're doing anymore.

66
00:02:57.524 --> 00:03:00.097
So it's like,
don't become learned helplessness.

67
00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:01.712
This is why I'm not showing the tools.

68
00:03:01.712 --> 00:03:05.454
I just don't think they're great unless
if you really know what you're doing, and

69
00:03:05.454 --> 00:03:07.892
at that point, almost always,
you don't need them.

70
00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:11.212
Other than, like, I don't know how
to do CSS center, the text flex box.

71
00:03:11.212 --> 00:03:12.563
What are the four properties I need?

72
00:03:12.563 --> 00:03:15.846
Okay, there they are, I could have just
used Google or AI, just I don't have to

73
00:03:15.846 --> 00:03:18.993
click through three links to get to
the thing, or have to save 9000 ads.

74
00:03:18.993 --> 00:03:21.372
So I'm just choosing AI to avoid ads,
right?

75
00:03:21.372 --> 00:03:24.523
It's a little bit different, and
so I didn't wanna talk about that.

76
00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:26.689
And lastly,
the products are just moving so fast.

77
00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.363
When I first did this one,
it was just Copilot.

78
00:03:29.363 --> 00:03:32.376
Now, how many different
AI things can you do?

79
00:03:32.376 --> 00:03:34.402
You can even run your
own with Facebook Llama.

80
00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.902
You can have this,
you can have all these mini ones.

81
00:03:35.902 --> 00:03:37.751
You got Cursor, you got Strawberry.

82
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:40.538
You got all these different
ones all popping and so

83
00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:44.319
it's like anything that I show you
today will become deprecated and

84
00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.988
irrelevant within like
the next three months.

85
00:03:46.988 --> 00:03:50.625
All the tools that I showed you now
have been around for the last 30 years,

86
00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:51.271
40 years.

87
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:53.490
Grep, I think might be even 50 years old.

88
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.450
And so it's like, these are really old,

89
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.867
well-tested things that are going to
continue to be around probably for

90
00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:01.511
the next 50 years and
just keep on being useful to you.

91
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:03.597
So I wanted to keep it focused on that,

92
00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:07.593
cuz I didn't wanna get distracted
with things that feel shiny and cool.

93
00:04:07.593 --> 00:04:09.872
And maybe they do help you and
make you more productive.

94
00:04:09.872 --> 00:04:12.375
If all you're doing is
building Laravel endpoints.

95
00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:13.706
Yeah, they're pretty cool,

96
00:04:13.706 --> 00:04:16.377
because every Laravel endpoint
effectively looks the same.

97
00:04:16.377 --> 00:04:19.372
So you can just go pop, pop, pop, pop,
pop, pop, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

98
00:04:19.372 --> 00:04:20.828
this feels Feels great, this is fast.

99
00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:22.205
I can see why you like AI.

100
00:04:22.205 --> 00:04:26.448
But if you're building anything bespoke at
all, even remotely bespoke, the speed and

101
00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:29.103
enjoyment you get from it
just goes drastically down.

102
00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:31.066
And so
I didn't want to go over that stuff,

103
00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:33.972
cuz I just find it largely
uninteresting in its current state.

104
00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:36.282
Maybe in like five years,
it'll be super cool.

105
00:04:36.282 --> 00:04:40.066
And my whole tune about everything will
completely change, willing to eat crow.

106
00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:43.722
Totally willing, but right now,
there you go, there's my only AI rant.
