00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.531
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: All right,
welcome to the course.

2
00:00:01.531 --> 00:00:03.557
I hope everyone is excited.

3
00:00:03.557 --> 00:00:06.599
This one is gonna be called
Dev Productivity 2, or

4
00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:10.720
as the more cool name's gonna be,
my dev setup is better than yours.

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.595
And I think it is, and

6
00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.479
I know a lot of people think that
there's many right ways to do things.

7
00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.966
I think some ways are more
right than others, and

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.949
you're gonna see the way that
I think is the most is right.

9
00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.888
All right, there you go.

10
00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:21.904
That's really the intro.

11
00:00:21.904 --> 00:00:22.898
Who am I?

12
00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:27.038
Well, the name is ThePrimeagen, you
probably heard me say that once or twice.

13
00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:30.884
I have two links here, and some odd reason
it says handcrafted memes and toilet.

14
00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:34.296
And I noticed this yesterday, and
I just choose not to change that.

15
00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:37.357
I think that that is a perfect
description of what happens, and

16
00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:38.872
we're gonna keep that there.

17
00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:43.188
All right fantastic the goal
today is to show you my approach

18
00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.358
to a developer environment.

19
00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:47.658
And so, as I like to say,
there isn't a right way, but

20
00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:48.918
I think my way is pretty good.

21
00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:52.405
I only have one thing in which I optimize,
which is productivity.

22
00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:55.182
I do not really care to make
something look beautiful.

23
00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:59.016
This is DHHS setup, which looks fantastic.

24
00:00:59.016 --> 00:00:59.894
I mean it's beautiful.

25
00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:01.060
It has little spaces.

26
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.787
It has little names up at
the top of all the files.

27
00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:06.727
It looks really nice, but I don't
really care if something looks nice.

28
00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:08.705
I really just want it to
be highly functional.

29
00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:12.524
I don't spend any time making
something look or feel great.

30
00:01:12.524 --> 00:01:16.827
I just want to be able to press a key
go where I want, have what I want,

31
00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.568
as fast as possible, without searching.

32
00:01:19.568 --> 00:01:21.294
I think searching is an anti-pattern.

33
00:01:21.294 --> 00:01:24.599
If you have to use your eyeballs
to look at where you want to go,

34
00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:27.985
you have fundamentally goofed
up your developer experience.

35
00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:29.989
I can't tell you how many
people I see tabbing, but

36
00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.564
they have like three to four
things they're tabbing in between.

37
00:01:32.564 --> 00:01:35.790
So they're constantly doing that thing,
and then they miss it once and

38
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.832
go around the entire
cycle just to come back,

39
00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:40.176
or they hit the shift tab
if they're feeling real.

40
00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:44.005
Real good, like you just give up
the fight, find something better,

41
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.197
press one key, be where you want to be.

42
00:01:46.197 --> 00:01:48.259
So there going to the midwit meme.

43
00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.510
I call it a midwit, the people that just
wanna make their system really beautiful.

44
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.920
Because often what ends up
happening is that people spend so

45
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.503
much time configuring their system,
they actually turn into the meme itself.

46
00:01:59.503 --> 00:02:03.178
Where they spend more time trying
to make it the best possible.

47
00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:07.306
And the most beautiful trying out every
last new library, every last new them,

48
00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:08.735
that they become the meme.

49
00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:10.702
And I don't wanna be the meme, okay?

50
00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:15.591
I just simply wanna live
an optimized life and that is it.

51
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:17.426
So, that is the purpose
of this entire course.

52
00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:19.231
That is it there's nothing else.

53
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:23.250
A bit of a prerequisite everything that
I'm gonna be doing will be approached from

54
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.241
the Unix perspective for the most part.

55
00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:27.073
We'll be doing a little bit of bash,

56
00:02:27.073 --> 00:02:30.453
we'll be checking out some other
stuff like if you're on Windows.

57
00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:33.705
It's not that I don't think
you can't dev on Windows.

58
00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:37.433
It's just that I only use
it to play Space Marines or

59
00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:40.216
World of Warcraft or something else.

60
00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:43.619
I don't use it to actually do any
sort of development on and so

61
00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.170
I have no idea how it works.

62
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.281
I'm sure it's great,
I just don't wanna do it.

63
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:49.903
And I hear neovim is terrible, fake.

64
00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:51.140
I don't even play games.

65
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.513
I don't even play games, to tell you
the honest truth, I made that up so

66
00:02:54.513 --> 00:02:58.351
I could feel like we're connecting with
each other, but that's not even true.

67
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:00.429
Anyways, so there we go.

68
00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:05.545
That is the entire purpose of this course,
and I hope everybody's ready.
