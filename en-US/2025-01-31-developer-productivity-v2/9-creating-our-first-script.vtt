00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
&gt;&gt; ThePrimeagen: So let's start
with our first kind of script here.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.670
We still have four points left to address
for my perfect terminal navigation system,

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.064
which is gonna be multiple sessions
running based on directory.

4
00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:12.304
Navigate to sessions
with a name instantly.

5
00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:16.611
Fuzzy find for those directories and
run a script when I create new sessions.

6
00:00:16.611 --> 00:00:21.047
Those are what I consider the ultimate
experience of directories.

7
00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:25.256
So we're gonna start with 0.6 cuz I think
0.6 is the easiest, run a script or

8
00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:28.196
whatever programs I want when
I navigate to a directory.

9
00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:29.963
Whenever I create a new session,

10
00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:34.266
I have now created a new session that's
gonna point to say, I don't know, dev.

11
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:38.173
When it runs here, I want it to do two
things, one, I want it to check for

12
00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:41.903
some special dot file,
what we can call this ready or ready-tmux.

13
00:00:41.903 --> 00:00:45.425
I spelled that way wrong,
just go with it, all right?

14
00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:49.964
Spelling is not a sign of intelligence,
trust me, I'm right.

15
00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:54.703
Or it goes and checks in the home
directory for the exact same thing.

16
00:00:54.703 --> 00:00:59.949
I'm gonna keep misspelling it, that way
if I land into a folder, it checks for

17
00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.931
a specific startup script, or it attempts
to run, say, a generalized startup script.

18
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:09.275
So that way I have this nice kind of
motion, and this is shockingly easy.

19
00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:11.978
So we're just gonna write
the script really, really easily.

20
00:01:11.978 --> 00:01:15.098
I'm gonna go to dev-en, and
we're gonna be right here, and

21
00:01:15.098 --> 00:01:17.620
I'm gonna write a nice
little script right here.

22
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.779
And first off, let's just create,
what do we wanna call this?

23
00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:24.894
I wanna call this thing, I'm gonna
create a directory called local, and

24
00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:27.420
inside of local,
I'm gonna create something called bin.

25
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.232
And inside of bin, I'm gonna create
something called ready-tmux.

26
00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:38.510
And so notice that I did local bin ready,
this is a place where a lot of times

27
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.347
people put all their kind
of local executables.

28
00:01:41.347 --> 00:01:44.242
It probably would be better to
create something called local,

29
00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:45.942
I just thought of this this morning.

30
00:01:45.942 --> 00:01:50.255
I should just probably have local scripts,
and those are my scripts as opposed to bin

31
00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:52.698
being executable that
may be installed there.

32
00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:55.497
So that way I don't wipe out
a directory with executables

33
00:01:55.497 --> 00:01:59.536
cuz you don't wanna store executables in
your get, you wanna store the scripts.

34
00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.019
Probably better ways to do this,
but here we are, okay, people.

35
00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:02.914
We're right here, and

36
00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.250
we're just gonna live with all
the consequences of our life.

37
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.352
We are building out a script
that's going to look for

38
00:02:08.352 --> 00:02:13.444
a file that's in the directory that we're
currently in, and attempt to execute it.

39
00:02:13.444 --> 00:02:17.741
Or it's gonna look for a global script
that's in the home directory and

40
00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:18.680
execute that.

41
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.997
That way with tmux,
as we navigate to a new directory and

42
00:02:21.997 --> 00:02:25.185
create a new session,
we can then also execute this.

43
00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:28.723
So that way, if you like to have a couple
panes, if you like to have things

44
00:02:28.723 --> 00:02:32.105
organized in such a way, it will
just automatically do that for you.

45
00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:37.556
All right, sounds good,
it's a relatively simple script to write.

46
00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:39.460
The reason why I write
all these things and

47
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.739
kinda we're going over all this
like painful, excruciating detail.

48
00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.502
I think a lot of people think
these things are complicated,

49
00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:45.959
they're really just not
all that complicated.

50
00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.777
They're actually rather simple activities,
it's just taking advantage of path and

51
00:02:50.777 --> 00:02:51.573
a bit of bash.

52
00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:53.343
So we're gonna go like this.

53
00:02:53.343 --> 00:02:57.630
So if you do a -x, that will actually say,
is this thing executable?

54
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.641
-x, you get it?

55
00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:00.161
Yeah, looks pretty good.

56
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:04.542
So what I'll do is, if inside of this
directory there's something called

57
00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:09.217
ready-tmux and it's executable, well,
then we will execute ready-tmux.

58
00:03:09.217 --> 00:03:15.411
Yeah, else we can actually do, what is it,
else if, is that how you do that?

59
00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:18.285
Is that how you do that in crazy language?

60
00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:25.981
Elif, there is an executable in
my home that's called ready-tmux.

61
00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:29.971
We will also execute that,
or we will execute that.

62
00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:33.549
We won't also, we will execute that,
and then I'll just do a quick clear.

63
00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.568
So anything afterwards that has happened,
any extra printouts, anything like that,

64
00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:38.990
boom, get rid of everything.

65
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.539
You have a nice little screen,
everything looks pretty good.

66
00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:47.581
Now, I have this in my local bin, I'm
actually gonna rename this one to scripts,

67
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.834
I'm gonna start this whole scripts thing.

68
00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:52.154
And I've never done this
we're doing this live.

69
00:03:52.154 --> 00:03:55.998
So I'm just gonna do a quick
little look in my adult local,

70
00:03:55.998 --> 00:03:58.677
cuz I don't wanna destroy everything.

71
00:03:58.677 --> 00:03:59.714
Do I have something called scripts?

72
00:03:59.714 --> 00:04:05.049
No, I don't, so this should
theoretically work out just fine.

73
00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.773
So I'm gonna go to my dev-env, I'm gonna
take this, I'm gonna take local, and

74
00:04:09.773 --> 00:04:12.380
I'm just gonna simply go, home/ .local.

75
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.435
There we go, so I'm gonna copy
the directory from local to my local here.

76
00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:20.125
So that should just create
a script directory.

77
00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:23.527
Now, just to make sure that I'm not
completely terrible at programming,

78
00:04:23.527 --> 00:04:25.148
let's throw a quick draw in there.

79
00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:25.864
What do we got in here?

80
00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:26.938
Do you see the local?

81
00:04:26.938 --> 00:04:30.364
All right, here we go, so I'm going to
delete the local folder right here, and

82
00:04:30.364 --> 00:04:33.345
then I'm going to run, or
then I'm gonna copy over this right here.

83
00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:35.326
There's some extra periods,
but that's not a big deal.

84
00:04:35.326 --> 00:04:41.392
All right, do it all, make it happen,
fantastic, so now we have that.

85
00:04:41.392 --> 00:04:45.253
This is not something I was
planning on keeping so for

86
00:04:45.253 --> 00:04:49.044
now I'm just gonna do
a little hand edit right now.

87
00:04:49.044 --> 00:04:51.967
And I'm just gonna add
to path really quickly.

88
00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:55.240
So don't worry about that
local Scripts there we go,

89
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.431
right, I'm gonna get rid of that.

90
00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:58.565
Cuz I don't know what to do yet,

91
00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:00.461
I still gotta think about
how I want to organize that.

92
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:05.276
But for now,
that means I should be able to go echo

93
00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:09.751
$PATH grep -o -local/scripts, right?

94
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:13.259
There it is, okay, so we do have it
in there, yay, which means also,

95
00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:14.756
I should be able to go in here.

96
00:05:14.756 --> 00:05:20.955
And whoopsie daisies, let's go right
here and go, let's go ls into here.

97
00:05:20.955 --> 00:05:23.303
There you go, ready-tmux,
which means that.ready-tmux,

98
00:05:23.303 --> 00:05:25.615
let's just make sure I might
actually have multiple of these.

99
00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:28.762
So let me just make sure I
don't have multiple of those.

100
00:05:28.762 --> 00:05:32.932
So we have the same experience which
ready-tmux, that's gonna be in scripts,

101
00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:33.987
fantastic, okay.

102
00:05:33.987 --> 00:05:37.020
So there we go, we can see that
we have my ready-tmux right here.

103
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.420
So if I execute that,
if I go ready-tmux it just simply cleared,

104
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.780
didn't do anything nothing
actually happened.

105
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.144
So that means if were to vim and
go actually hold on,

106
00:05:48.144 --> 00:05:52.628
let's go do I have something just
to make sure I don't, okay good.

107
00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:55.207
I might forget to delete a few things.

108
00:05:55.207 --> 00:05:59.964
So that means if i jump in here and
I go ready-tmux theoretically I could

109
00:05:59.964 --> 00:06:04.979
have something in here that's gonna
be executable, user, bin and bash.

110
00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.069
Do that, I'll go tmux, new window.

111
00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.826
So I'm just gonna have it create a new
window, and I'm gonna name ii foo, foo,

112
00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:12.540
all right?

113
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.018
Yeah, right, sounds fantastic, so now,

114
00:06:17.018 --> 00:06:21.141
if I go ready-tmux, did that not work?

115
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.868
Are you not entertained?

116
00:06:23.868 --> 00:06:25.961
Did I mess that up?

117
00:06:25.961 --> 00:06:28.903
I didn't make it executable,
bam, executable.

118
00:06:28.903 --> 00:06:33.286
So now I should be able to do that, we
created a new thing, now notice, it runs.

119
00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:35.046
This is exactly what we wanted to see,
right?

120
00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:39.063
It should always run this way, when I do
it again, it should just hopefully, boom,

121
00:06:39.063 --> 00:06:40.828
we got it again, okay, Fantastic.

122
00:06:40.828 --> 00:06:45.447
So now we've been kind of built that like
that just tiny little bit we needed,

123
00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:49.091
which is not a lot like that's
a very simple script to write.

124
00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:51.721
And now it just sits somewhere
where it's executable, and

125
00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:53.937
now we just simply got to
take advantage of it now.

126
00:06:53.937 --> 00:06:57.365
So let's go back here,
we did all that very easy.

127
00:06:57.365 --> 00:06:58.978
Look at that,
it's pretty much identical code.

128
00:06:58.978 --> 00:07:01.963
It's like I planned this before,
all right, that was pretty cool, right?

129
00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:06.414
We could even take it and you could
technically like bind it to a tmux, key so

130
00:07:06.414 --> 00:07:10.085
you could do, I don't know,
Ctrl A capital S, and it'd be,

131
00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:12.366
whoosh, ready up your environment.

132
00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:14.365
Or you could attach to
your window manager, or

133
00:07:14.365 --> 00:07:17.236
you could do some sort of mod and
capital S or whatever you wanna do,

134
00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:19.563
or you could put it in Zish and
do something with that.

135
00:07:19.563 --> 00:07:21.572
But think none of those are very useful,

136
00:07:21.572 --> 00:07:24.361
cuz I don't ever want to
manually execute that script.

137
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:28.917
I just want that script to exist and
execute when I open up a new tmux session.

138
00:07:28.917 --> 00:07:31.439
So let's do that, so there we go.

139
00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:33.249
So now we only have three things left,

140
00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:35.919
we have multiple sessions
running based on directory.

141
00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.982
We should be able to navigate
to any of these directories, and

142
00:07:37.982 --> 00:07:39.900
we should be able to Fuzzy
find any of those directories.

143
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.740
So we're gonna do a quick detour,

144
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.236
I'm gonna show you one of my greatest
things of all time or not my.

145
00:07:45.236 --> 00:07:48.017
One of my favorite things of all time,
which is FCF.

146
00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:49.515
FCF is absolutely fantastic.

147
00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:52.834
Here's how you would install it,
we could, theoretically, in dev end,

148
00:07:52.834 --> 00:07:54.902
you could add this under,
say, a libs thing.

149
00:07:54.902 --> 00:07:57.608
You could add in get clone, this FCF.

150
00:07:57.608 --> 00:08:01.414
You could then do this, and then on your
zsh profile, you could also have this

151
00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:05.356
right here, which says, hey, if this
thing is a file, then source that file.

152
00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:09.108
And that little zsh thing has some
extra cool stuff associated with it.

153
00:08:09.108 --> 00:08:11.726
So I can do this, when I press Ctrl R,
instead of going and

154
00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:14.785
doing a recursive search up your
history where you start typing and

155
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:18.084
it shows you one result, instead you
get this beautiful fuzzy finder.

156
00:08:18.084 --> 00:08:21.184
So if I go Vim, you can see all
the different ways I've vimed, right?

157
00:08:21.184 --> 00:08:25.412
If I go git clone, you can see all
the different dumb things I put.

158
00:08:25.412 --> 00:08:29.593
This right here, crazy programming
language in which you have to

159
00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:32.795
try to specify how to teach
the AI is what you want.

160
00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:33.870
It's just crazy, right?

161
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.556
And so
you can do anything you want right there.

162
00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:38.911
So now it's like a really nice fuzzy find
that also allows you to select things out.

163
00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:43.025
But here's where it gets really good,
if I go like this,

164
00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:47.510
echo 1\n2\n3\n, and I take that and
I pipe it into FCF.

165
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.839
Notice I can choose which one I want.

166
00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:53.586
So anything go into FCF, and then you
can fuzzy, find over the top of it.

167
00:08:53.586 --> 00:08:56.406
You can go like this,
I want three, notice what it did,

168
00:08:56.406 --> 00:09:00.201
the standard in gave it its input,
the standard out gave out what I select.

169
00:09:00.201 --> 00:09:02.392
So I just selected 3, and
that's all it gave me.

170
00:09:02.392 --> 00:09:05.080
So you can see the power that
we're about to have here,

171
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.016
the power is just incredible, right?
