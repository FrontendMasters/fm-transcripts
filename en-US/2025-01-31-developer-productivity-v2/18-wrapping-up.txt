>> ThePrime agen: For me, making my experience and everything better makes me happy, that's what I like. I like to find out new ways to be able to program, to make things better. I like trying out new languages cuz it changes the way I look at things. Oddly enough, I know this is gonna sound completely just insane, but I actually had a ton of fun learning how to program emojilang, yes.

[00:00:20]
I learned how to program emojilang, I know what this file actually does. And there's actually super cool concepts specifically in emojilang that you just wouldn't get somewhere else. I know that sounds completely, it just sound a little crazy, but honestly, it's really interesting look that emojilang even asked right here.

[00:00:37]
That's lion stands for sort, sort collection left with closure that takes a, b, a-b, look at that, that's just like your Javascript.sort with a- b, the same thing, right? I just love this kind of perspective of it, and it has this slightly unique perspective about optionals and air objects.

[00:00:53]
And it was just fun, it's fun, I just enjoy doing the dumb things, cuz I like to learn about things, and even when it provides me absolutely nothing. It's still something for me to look at and see a new way to solve problems, and it's just like the joy of it is the reason why I do it.

[00:01:07]
It's not just simply to get a task done. I think that's a very important difference, getting tests done, obviously, very important, that's why I optimize to be fast. But the whole point is not simply to be at the end, it's to both do the walk and get to the end.

[00:01:21]
And I will never say, you'll never hear me say, the journey is better than the destination, cuz that's a horrible life outlook. Let me just correct it right now, the journey can be important, but it's not as good as the destination, cuz that means you're always going downhill, don't live that life.

[00:01:33]
The destination has to, in fact, be better than the journey, or else you will always have nothing to look forward to, don't forget that. Don't let anyone be bamboozle you on that one. All right, an important note, the most important thing about this course is not to do what I do, but to do what you want to do.

[00:01:45]
You saw how I approached it, hopefully you went, hey, I could change it like this, or, hey, I would much rather do it this completely different way. Hopefully I just gave you the keys to go, I can do anything. That's really the goal of the course, is to show that your dev setup is better than mine because it's for you, it's not for me, and just like mine is better than yours because it's for me, right?

[00:02:08]
That's why I intentionally titled it this way. Is because that's how I think, is that mine is better because it's been built only for me, I didn't think about you. I'm sorry, Dapper, I didn't think about you, buddy. This is just what I built it for, I built it for me, and that's it.

[00:02:24]
And that is, in fact, the end of this course.
