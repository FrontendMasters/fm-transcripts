00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.222
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Part 1, we're
going to create a custom Gatsby theme.

2
00:00:03.222 --> 00:00:08.270
It's gonna be a documentation theme,
and that's going to use MDX.

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.170
If you've watched the the other
workshop that I did on Gatsby it for

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.090
front end masters we use MDX.

5
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.880
But if you haven't used MDX before, don't
worry, we're gonna cover all of it here.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.490
We're gonna define some custom data type.

7
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.540
So we're gonna define an actual docs page,
generic type that uses MDX.

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.235
We'll use Theme UI which is a wonderful
library from Jackson Black that

9
00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:32.521
allows us to kind of set up colors and
font sizes and

10
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:36.055
things in a way that's composable and
easy to share.

11
00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:39.120
We will also add support for
live edited example code.

12
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.990
We're gonna be using react
live from Formidable Labs.

13
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.080
It's a really cool way to show a code
sample and the result of that code sample

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.380
in a way that somebody can edit and
see the results immediately.

15
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.610
Then, once we're done with that, we're
going to install that custom theme on

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.060
an existing site I built a fake JavaScript
library and then I decided I couldn't

17
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.310
have a fake JavaScript library so I built
a real one, it's called Honkify and

18
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.030
if you remember the untitled goose game,
what it does is it makes all of the links

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.090
on your site honk instead of actually
clicking through the thing you wanted to.

20
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.560
So that was a great way to procrastinate.

21
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.690
We're also gonna customize the theme.

22
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.243
So we're going to install the the docs
theme on to this hongfei site and then

23
00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:26.175
we'll customize the theme using options so
that it looks like the hongfei site.

24
00:01:26.175 --> 00:01:28.596
We'll use component shadowing
to extend Theme UIs so

25
00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:31.462
we'll be able to override colors,
fonts, things like that.

26
00:01:31.462 --> 00:01:34.110
Then we're going to build
a site from scratch.

27
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.454
We'll build a fan site for Negroni
which are my current favorite cocktail.

28
00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:41.182
And we'll use that docs theme, but
we're not gonna use it for docs.

29
00:01:41.182 --> 00:01:41.850
We're gonna use it for

30
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.870
recipes, which means that we're gonna
have to make some modifications to it.

31
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.640
So we'll extend Theme UI again.

32
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.642
But then we're going to do some fun stuff.

33
00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.810
We're gonna get into
Cloudinary to manage images so

34
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.130
that our image pipeline is nice and fast.

35
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.230
We're just gonna upload things to
Cloudinary, let Cloudinary do the work so

36
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.705
that our buildings pipeline
doesn't slow down.

37
00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:02.965
We're also gonna use component
shadowing to customize components,

38
00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:06.645
because we don't necessarily
want any reference to docs.

39
00:02:06.645 --> 00:02:09.228
We want to update that
to reference recipes, so

40
00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:11.496
we'll be making those switches as well.

41
00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:14.625
And then we'll just install a second
theme to see how that composes together.

42
00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:17.630
So we'll install an events
theme that I built before.

43
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.100
And we'll just plug that in and
see how it works.

44
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.088
And then finally, we're gonna set up a
dynamic app that uses client side GraphQL

45
00:02:25.088 --> 00:02:28.600
with Apollo,
we will configure client only routes and

46
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.778
Gatsby, so
this will be a linkable search results.

47
00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:35.834
So we're gonna use the Rick and
Morty API to look up characters.

48
00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:37.687
And whenever you search for

49
00:02:37.687 --> 00:02:41.580
something you want to be able to send
a link to that search results said

50
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.326
to someone and have them click on it and
see the same search results.

51
00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:47.760
So we're gonna build that will
set up redirects and nullify so

52
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.710
that this works locally and
when you deploy it, and

53
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.890
then we'll use react hooks
to set up a search form.

54
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.180
And the results page,
as I mentioned, will be linkable.

55
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.870
So, with all of that being said,
let's get started.

56
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.540
You are welcome to code along.

57
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.630
I have a tendency to go a little bit fast.

58
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.240
So also feel free to just sit back and
absorb it.

59
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.640
And all of this is gonna be online and

60
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.807
you'll be able to revisit it
check out two different points.

61
00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:20.687
But yeah, if you want to if
you want to clone the repo,

62
00:03:20.687 --> 00:03:23.340
it's at jlang storf/gatsby-intermediate.

63
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.630
And we'll be starting
from the start branch.
