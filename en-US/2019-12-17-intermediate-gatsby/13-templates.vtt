00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.510
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Now that we
are able to get that custom data,

2
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.840
we can start using it.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.742
So let's get these stuff
up onto the screen.

4
00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:14.514
So the first thing that we're gonna need
is we're gonna need react components

5
00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.510
to actually show this stuff on the screen.

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.920
So let's get into our theme docs.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.400
And we're gonna create
a couple new things.

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.380
So the first thing we want is a template.

9
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.970
And this is a convention that I like,
but that is not required.

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.030
Whenever I create pages
programmatically in Gatsby,

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.290
I like to call them templates
the component that gets used by Gatsby's

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.920
on page create, I call that a template and
I keep those in a separate directory.

13
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.132
So I'm gonna create source templates and

14
00:00:48.132 --> 00:00:52.740
I'll call this one docs page template.js.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.400
And inside of it,
I'm going to import react from react and

16
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.950
I will import the MDXRenderer,
so this is the helper that

17
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.640
I was talking about awhile back that'll
help us show that MDX stuff is code.

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.268
So MDX gives us this,
like this functions and stuff, and

19
00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:17.182
that pulls out that layout component that
we use and it wraps up all the same MDX

20
00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:22.116
stuff, so that if we write React inside
of our MDX files it'll get rendered.

21
00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:24.560
But we don't wanna have
to manually parse that.

22
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.330
So the Docs page template is going
to do one thing, which is load data.

23
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.660
And then we'll build a Docs page
component that will display data.

24
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.992
And that's a very deliberate choice
to separate the sourcing of the data,

25
00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:42.666
from the display of the data, because what
it means is that if I wanna make changes

26
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:47.271
to one or the other, I don't necessarily
wanna have to rewrite the full query or

27
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:49.021
rewrite the full component.

28
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:53.042
When we get into component shadowing it's
a little easier to understand why that's

29
00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:55.000
a helpful distinction to make.

30
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.490
But so, in a template what we'll do is
we wanna have React in the context so

31
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.210
we'll import React from React.

32
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.510
And then we're going to import graph qL,
from Gatsby.

33
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.520
And then we're going to export a query.

34
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.310
So the query, it has to be exported.

35
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.350
It doesn't necessarily
need to be named query.

36
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.070
You can name it whatever you want, but
Gatsby does require that it is export it.

37
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.220
And what we're doing here is
what's called a page query.

38
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.840
And these only work on files that will be

39
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.290
parsed as part of the the page
creation process by Gatsby.

40
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.250
So in the on Create Page or

41
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.710
the create pages API is
the only time that this works.

42
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.260
And that's why I like to keep these in
a separate folder under templates so that

43
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.149
it's more clear that these get handled
differently than the average component.

44
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.830
So the query that I wanna write is
going to load a page by its ID.

45
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.920
So what I wanna do to show how
that works is, we get an ID, and

46
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.150
let's just write our query here.

47
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.450
So, one of the ways that I love to develop
in Gatsby is to use the GraphQL explorer,

48
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.730
and just copy paste it in so I can verify
that my queries work before I save it and

49
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.800
start up Gatsby.

50
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.580
So the first thing I'm going to
do is set up a query variable.

51
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.860
And I'm gonna call this page ID.

52
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.210
And the page ID is going to be a string,

53
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.480
and we're gonna give it
the this ID from the homepage.

54
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.930
So to use that,
I can close this docs page, and

55
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.609
I'm gonna do a single docs page request.

56
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.910
And I want to use this page ID that we
set up, so now I can reference this.

57
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.280
And to source that I want to make sure
that the page we request matches that ID.

58
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.770
And then inside of it
I wanna get the title

59
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.550
when it was updated, and
I want to make that relative to now and

60
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.500
then I want the body and
that's all I need to display the page.

61
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.011
So we're gonna stick with that.

62
00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:08.730
And I think I,
oops I forgot to start the server.

63
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.484
So let's yarn workspace theme-dev develop.

64
00:04:18.768 --> 00:04:22.600
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, and
now when I run it, it should work.

65
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.530
So we've got the homepage, it was updated
an hour ago and it's got this body in it.

66
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.100
So that I can then just copy and

67
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.140
drop straight in here, fix my indent so
that it looks the way I want.

68
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.590
And so
this page ID is gonna have to get set.

69
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.470
But we can set that from the Create
Page API in Gatsby using context.

70
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.110
We'll look at that in a second
when we go to use this, template.
