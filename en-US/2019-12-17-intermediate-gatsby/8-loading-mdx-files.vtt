00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.280
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
when we create an MDX file,

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.140
and I'm gonna create this in our
theme dev in that docs folder, and

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.730
we're just gnna call it index because
I want a kind of a homepage, right?

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.602
So, the default way of writing
MDX is we can just say,

5
00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:16.370
Hello and that's a page, right?

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.164
Like that could be a page on the Internet.

7
00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:21.800
We wanna add a little more
information than that.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.260
So I'm actually gonna start
with some front matter.

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.630
And the way that front matter
works in Markdown is we use these

10
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.530
triple dashes as a kind
of fenced code block.

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.980
And then we use YAML syntax to
say what our front matter is.

12
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.280
So we want a field called title
to show up on a front matter, and

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.040
this will be what the value of it is and
these are arbitrary.

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.530
You can set whatever you want in here and
most YAML syntax should work.

15
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.357
And then below our code block,
we can say something like, These are docs!

16
00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:01.547
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And on saving that,

17
00:01:01.547 --> 00:01:07.430
we've got a completely valid MDX file
that we can use however we want.

18
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.630
So let's get this loaded into the site
using the theme so that we can show it.

19
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.370
So the first thing that we're
gonna do is we're going to

20
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.930
install some things in the theme.

21
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.837
So we'll go yarn workspace
gatsby-theme-docs,

22
00:01:23.837 --> 00:01:27.830
and we will add
the gatsby-source-file-system.

23
00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:33.450
And what Gatsby-source-file-system
does is it allows us to use

24
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.060
a folder in the project
itself as a data source.

25
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.030
So it'll put it in the GraphQL layer so
we can do stuff with it.

26
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.220
Then we're going to use
gatsby-plugin-mdx and

27
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.460
what Gatsby plugin MDX
will do is it'll look for

28
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.860
any files that are of the type dot MDX And
it will convert them into MDX nodes,

29
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.168
which means that we can get
at the content of that file.

30
00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:59.665
And then gatsby-plugin-mdx
has some dependencies, so

31
00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:02.968
we need to use the mdx-js/mdx package and

32
00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:07.111
then we also need to use
the mdx-js/react package.

33
00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:10.225
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
we'll get those installed.

34
00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:18.346
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And now,
we can get those configured

35
00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:22.800
in our gatsby-config for the theme.

36
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.982
So we're gonna create
a gatsby-config next to our

37
00:02:25.982 --> 00:02:30.742
gatsby-node,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And

38
00:02:30.742 --> 00:02:33.505
again, we're going to do module.exports.

39
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.590
Now the standard way that you would
write a config file is you would have

40
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.950
just an object, right?

41
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.330
But because we're in a theme, this becomes
a function that receives those options.

42
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.650
And because we're receiving options,
we wanna use our defaults.

43
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.836
So let's import that, we're gonna import
with defaults and require utility file.

44
00:02:57.017 --> 00:03:00.070
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And so up here
we're going to get the things we need.

45
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.000
So we're gonna use the contentPath cuz we
need to tell the file system where to look

46
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.320
and we're going to use external MDX
because we need to know whether or

47
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.000
not we should load the MDX
plugin inside the theme.

48
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.640
So we'll say withDefaults(options),

49
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.020
and then we can return our config object.

50
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.980
And in this case,
we're just gonna return some plugins.

51
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.542
The first one is always gonna be used and
that is resolve gatsby-source-file-system.

52
00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:35.474
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And the options
that we wanna send it first is name, and

53
00:03:35.474 --> 00:03:37.530
I'm gonna use the plugin name.

54
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.590
And we'll talk more about why in a minute,
but the general idea

55
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.800
is that we wanna be able to identify
which files were loaded by this theme.

56
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.780
Because when we go to
create pages from it,

57
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.160
if another theme uses MDX, we wouldn't
want to create docs pages out of

58
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.291
some a blog themes, MDX files.

59
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:06.142
And we wanna grab those
from the contentPath.

60
00:04:06.142 --> 00:04:11.657
So, this will give us the files
that we want in our file system.

61
00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:15.799
And,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's

62
00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.430
get the Markdown here.

63
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.320
So we'll go useExternalMDX.

64
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.630
So if useExternalMDX is set to true
we're just gonna skip this whole step.

65
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.930
So that's what we're checking here.

66
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.510
And so if it is false,

67
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.120
we're going to say resolve
gatsby-plugin-mdx and

68
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.530
for the options,
we will use defaultLayouts.

69
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.830
And we haven't defined this yet, but
we're gonna set up a default layout for

70
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.800
our MDX files.

71
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.150
And what this means is that when we load
an MDX file, Gatsby is going to look for

72
00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.250
this wrapper component and
put the MDX files inside of it.

73
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.820
And that gives us a way
to control the output

74
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.020
without having to write a bunch of custom
code inside of the MDX files themselves.

75
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.842
And so we will put that at
source/components/layout.js.

76
00:05:16.372 --> 00:05:18.829
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
finally, once we get down here,

77
00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:22.477
because there's a chance
that this is gonna be false,

78
00:05:22.477 --> 00:05:27.235
we are going to filter our plugin array
because we wanna make sure that we

79
00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:32.581
don't send back just a false value
that'll cause Gatsby to complain.

80
00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:37.755
So we're gonna filter for Boolean so
that it drops any false values.

81
00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:40.256
That's kind of a hacky
way to say like if it

82
00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.895
exists
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: But I really like this

83
00:05:42.895 --> 00:05:46.037
as a way of kind of keeping it terse
when you're doing that sort of thing.
