00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.889
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's go ahead and
style up our docs page a little bit,

2
00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.947
I wanna de-emphasize this,
this update time is useful.

3
00:00:07.947 --> 00:00:10.034
But we don't want it to be
like right in your face or

4
00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:13.220
to look as important as the rest
of the content on the screen.

5
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.920
So let's go into our docs page,
and let's add some styles, and

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.320
I'm gonna do that by replacing React.

7
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.520
We're gonna use the JSX pragma, again,
I'm gonna import JSX from theme-ui.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.518
And then I'm going to just
add some basic styles here,

9
00:00:33.518 --> 00:00:37.510
we'll do sx.

10
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.410
And inside of it,
we can say the border top, and now,

11
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.700
we're gonna get into an advanced case.

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.605
You can actually just access
the whole theme object as a prop,

13
00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:54.500
or as an argument passed to a function,
so I can just do theme and

14
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.060
then return whatever I want from it.

15
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.990
So if I want to set my border for

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.923
example to be 1px soli,d and

17
00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:12.121
then we'll use the theme.colors.muted,
that'll work.

18
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:16.030
And then I can set the color of
the text itself to be muted.

19
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.820
I can set the font size, we'll make it
a little bit smaller so I'll set at 14.

20
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.610
We want some margin top,
we want some padding top, and

21
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.284
let's see how that looks,
yeah, that looks pretty good.

22
00:01:31.284 --> 00:01:34.250
It's de-emphasize, it's clear that
it's a separate part of thing.

23
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.590
It's not taking over the the page, and

24
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.480
that, I think is probably
a good place to call this set.

25
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.740
So let's commit our work,
and then we can move on.

26
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quick question.

27
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.858
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In the line number 12,

28
00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:52.309
where you set the border for
the top there.

29
00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:54.588
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you have just use

30
00:01:54.588 --> 00:01:59.917
the string muted, or
do you have to use that return?

31
00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:05.760
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Theme UI has certain
fields that are set up to accept

32
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.330
the keywords, border top is
a composite field, so it doesn't.

33
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.510
And that's because you'd have to
get into some string parsing that

34
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.814
could get really tricky.

35
00:02:16.814 --> 00:02:22.650
So as just a guard against complexity,

36
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.660
they opted to use
the functions syntax instead.

37
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.672
There is on the Theme UI site I
believe a reference of which fields

38
00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:34.669
accepts which keywords.

39
00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:39.403
And then in any other case, like
honestly try it, and if it doesn't work,

40
00:02:39.403 --> 00:02:42.120
just switch out for the function version.

41
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.326
So let's get this committed.

42
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:56.146
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Add Theme UI and
get that pushed up.

43
00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:58.220
Okay, so
