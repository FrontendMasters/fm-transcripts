00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.620
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Next, we're going to
check whether or not the folder exists.

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.254
So I'm going to include another
system library, fs, and

3
00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:12.439
we will just grab that out.

4
00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.589
So both path and fs are built in the node.

5
00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.210
We don't have to install those.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.240
So then I can say if, and
we're gonna negate this if it's not true.

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.370
So if it doesn't exist and
we're gonna use sync so

8
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.840
we that we don't have to do chaining and
we'll say if the directory doesn't exist,

9
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.560
we need to create it.

10
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.620
But we have a problem here, which is that,
I did this again, it's exports not export.

11
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:50.020
Got my cases confused today.

12
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.150
If this doesn't exist,
we need to create it, but the problem with

13
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.300
the default make directory command is
that it will only do one level at a time.

14
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.930
And there is nothing stopping somebody
from saying that they want their content

15
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.490
directory to be source content docs, and
that would be three directories that would

16
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.840
need to be created which would
choke the standard mkdir command.

17
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.760
So we're gonna use a library to make this
simpler, and this is called mkdir p or

18
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.378
the way that I say it in my head is
mkdirp so we're going to yarn workspace

19
00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:31.270
gatsby-theme-docs add mkdirp.

20
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.470
If I can spell it, mkdirp.

21
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.229
This will allow us to actually

22
00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.140
create directories recursively.

23
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.569
So we're gonna import that.

24
00:01:47.797 --> 00:01:53.158
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
if the directory doesn't exist,

25
00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:55.843
we will create it.

26
00:01:55.843 --> 00:01:59.063
So we will run sync.

27
00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:02.618
Again, we're just trying to make sure that
these things happen before it moves on

28
00:02:02.618 --> 00:02:03.811
to the next part of the API.

29
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:06.250
That's why we're using
the synchronous mode.

30
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.970
And these operations
should be pretty quick.

31
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.050
So in terms of performance
cost it's gonna be negligible.

32
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.800
That then, should work.

33
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.800
So let's go ahead and run our start.

34
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.470
And we'll see over here in the theme dev,
we do not have a docs folder.

35
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.670
So if we did this right,
what will happen is I'm gonna start

36
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.040
the theme dev site in develop mode, and
we will see that docs folder pop up.

37
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.078
Let's go ahead and do that.

38
00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:39.506
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We'll run yarn
workspace theme-dev develop, and

39
00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:43.760
we should see docs pop up,
and there it is.

40
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.950
So now,
if we try to access that directory,

41
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.830
if we use the gatsby source filesystem
which we're gonna get to in a second, then

42
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.330
that will prevent us from getting an error
that the content path can't be found.

43
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.480
So that's a good point to commit.

44
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.650
Let's just check our progress here.

45
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.875
We have modified the package JSON
because we installed mkdirp,

46
00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:11.200
wrote our onprebootstrapping,
we wrote that utility folder.

47
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.732
Let's just add all of that and

48
00:03:15.732 --> 00:03:21.716
we'll get commit and say theme-dev,

49
00:03:21.716 --> 00:03:26.078
add onprebootstrap stuff.
