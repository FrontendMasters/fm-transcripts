00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.570
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's create that
layout file that we just said was going

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.070
to exist.

3
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.489
So that's going to be at
source components layout.js.

4
00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:11.360
Source components layout.js.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.220
And inside of this I'm going
to import react from react.

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.620
And you may have noticed that I haven't
actually installed react Gatsby or

7
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.390
react Dom in this theme.

8
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.890
That’s because it’s coming from
the site that installs it.

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.390
You can set it up as a peer dependency and
that’s probably a good practice.

10
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.730
Because I know for
a fact that the theme dev is using it and

11
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.870
any Gatsby site is gonna have
Gatsby react and react dom.

12
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.770
It’s not strictly required.

13
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.850
If it’s not there, it’s gonna break.

14
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.330
So I'm gonna rely on the the parent
theme to have it create a layout.

15
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.410
And that layout is gonna receive children.

16
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.440
That's the the content.

17
00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.200
And we'll just put out a react fragment
and that will have a header in it.

18
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.660
And the header will just
say the name of the theme.

19
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.000
We're not going for design awards here.

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.510
And we'll set up a main component
that will receive the children.

21
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.200
Export that as our default.

22
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.270
And we should be in business.

23
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.970
So let's go ahead and
run this and see what happens.

24
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.070
So I'm gonna yarn workspace
theme-dev develop.

25
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.390
And what I expect to happen is that
it's going to read this index.mdx and

26
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.590
I'll be able to get the content
of it in our graphQL layer.

27
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.379
So let's run it.

28
00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:48.633
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
now we haven't created any pages,

29
00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:51.030
we're not telling Gatsby
to use the data yet.

30
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.330
We've just added it to the data layer,
which means that if we look at our

31
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.380
page, like our development site,
there's still nothing there.

32
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.460
But Gatsby gives us access
to the graphQL layer.

33
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.880
So I can go into this graphql layer and

34
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.570
I can now see that we've got
things like all file and all MDX.

35
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.250
So let's take a look at this all MDX and
see what's in here.

36
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.403
So I wanna see maybe the frontmatter and
the title.

37
00:02:20.418 --> 00:02:22.440
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,
so we've got our homepage.

38
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.010
It's showing up.

39
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.310
It's doing what we want.

40
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.987
And if I get the HTML,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Sorry,

41
00:02:30.987 --> 00:02:31.800
that's the wrong.

42
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.770
It's called body, that's my mistake.

43
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.960
So now we've got this body, and
now this is a little funky, right?

44
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.410
This is the content down here but MDX has
kinda wrapped all this stuff around it.

45
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.570
And that's where we get
into the layouts there.

46
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.450
And MDX is doing a bunch of stuff so

47
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.650
that we can execute react
inside of MDX content.

48
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.250
But we don't really need to worry about
this part because there's a helper that

49
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.100
we'll get to in a minute
that handles this for us.

50
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.320
If you just want to check what's in there,
we can do the raw body.

51
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.255
And that'll show us just the contents
of the file if you want to verify that

52
00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:10.480
something's there.

53
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.940
So that, I think,
is a good place to commit our work.

54
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.830
So let's again, just get at everything.

55
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.940
Check that again.

56
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.111
Okay, that's all we wanted so
we will commit.

57
00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:33.389
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Dev and
we added or load MDX into GraphQL.
