00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.680
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Next thing that
we want to do is we've got syntax

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.240
highlighting working, but
a really advanced feature of React and

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.050
something that we can do with MDX is we
can make our syntax highlighted blocks,

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.570
show a preview and then not only show
a preview, but make that preview editable.

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.730
So if we wanted to say build a component
library and show off a button.

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.000
We wanna be able to edit that button in
place and see the result right there.

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.500
It's a really good way, if you're writing
documentation to let people try out and

8
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.100
experience the way that the API of
something works without having to set up

9
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.310
the boiler plate for it.

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.070
So this is a really nice feature and
fortunately

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.720
the team at Formidable Labs has all
ready done a bunch of work on this.

12
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.340
So we're gonna be using
something called react live.

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.110
So to do that we can just
jump right in to our code and

14
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.830
say yarn workspace gatsby-theme-docs.

15
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.120
We're gonna add react-live, and it comes
with all the things that we need so

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.250
we don't have to add any
additional dependencies there.

17
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.860
Now that we've got react live,
we can use it and we just grab it in.

18
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.340
Right at the bottom here,
we're going to get the live provider.

19
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.160
So react live uses context and
we're going to access that context

20
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.170
to get our stuff and we access
that through a few sub components,

21
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.210
the live editor, which is where
people will be able to edit the code.

22
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.990
A live error in case the code is not
valid and a life preview where we can see

23
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.040
the results and
that will be imported from react live.

24
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.530
And the other thing that we're
going to need is a scope.

25
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.350
So react live will allow us to use
different components in the scope.

26
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.840
And that way we don't have to import
them anytime that we use them and

27
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.980
that makes it really handy again if
we're showing off a component library.

28
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.200
People shouldn't have to know
how the library is set up we

29
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.060
should just be able to say hey, try adding
a button and then when they add the button

30
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.190
component it just works they shouldn't
have to import button or anything.

31
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.360
So to do that we can import a scope or
we can define just an empty object and

32
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.840
add things to it is needed,
because this is a theme and

33
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.000
because we want people to be
able to easily modify this.

34
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.040
What we're gonna do is take a page out
of Gatsby plugin theme new eyes book and

35
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.420
we're gonna create a scope
file at the source root.

36
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.280
And that way it'll be easy to override,

37
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.460
easy to add in your own components
to the scope for live editing.

38
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.740
So to do that, we'll just jump
right into this source folder.

39
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.160
And I'm gonna create
a file called scope.js and

40
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.830
it lives right at source root.

41
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.970
So source.scope.js.

42
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.180
And inside of it,
we're just gonna export an empty object

43
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.210
because by default we don't
have anything in scope.

44
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.230
We're not gonna have custom
components coming out of our theme.

45
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.630
But then over here, we're gonna import
that scope and we'll get it from scope.

46
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.150
And then to implement this,

47
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.200
what's nice is we've all ready got most
of what we need with the code string.

48
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.680
So we can just check whether or
not the field supports react live.

49
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.970
And we wanna make this optional, right?

50
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.000
So we don't want every
syntax highlighted block,

51
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.390
to become a live editable
one cuz that will break.

52
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.745
A lot of syntax highlighted blocks
are showing partial code, incomplete code,

53
00:03:35.745 --> 00:03:40.020
pseudo code, things where the imports
aren't actually defined and

54
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.630
that would be chaos if we were to just
unleash that, always trying to live edit.

55
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.530
So we're gonna make this
configured by a attribute.

56
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.170
And the way that we'll do that is that
we're going to check if code props

57
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.630
has a react live attribute on it, and

58
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.460
if so, we're gonna return
a different set of code and

59
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.640
by default then, it'll use the prism.

60
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.280
So we've got three potential outcomes, if
there's no language specified we just use

61
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.440
a regular old pre tag and output, a pre
tag with whatever props were supplied.

62
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.200
If it's not marked with react live,
we're gonna output the prism react render.

63
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.370
If it is marked with react live,
we're gonna set up our live provider.

64
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.470
And inside of it,
we're gonna use the code of code string.

65
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.070
We're gonna set the scope and
that's our scope doc which as we

66
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.560
have currently defined it,
it's an empty object.

67
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.640
And then we're gonna set a theme and

68
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.242
we get to use the same theme as
the one that we're using in prism

69
00:04:48.242 --> 00:04:52.590
react render which is really handy
because we don't have to change things.

70
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.860
We just import one theme and
it just works.

71
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.800
So then we don't have to
do much with these because

72
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.860
we're putting all of that
stuff into the provider.

73
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.020
That means that the code string, and the
scope, and all of that is available via

74
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.910
context, which means that we can
just drop in the rest of these

75
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.530
without having to make a bunch of edits or
pass those probs multiple times.

76
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.200
On the LivePreview,
I wanna add a little bit of styling.

77
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.690
So let's add that in.

78
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.210
What I wanna do is, just because the
preview by default is gonna be just kind

79
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.490
of smashed against
the bottom of the CodeBlock.

80
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.870
So I wanna put a border around it and
will just do a little bit extra and

81
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.960
give us some pattern.

82
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.590
So let's start our border and
this is gonna access the theme object.

83
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.850
Do one pixel solid and

84
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.320
we will set it up to
be theme.colors.muted.

85
00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:00.420
Also we gonna give it padding of four and
in a lot of cases,

86
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.450
you'll have like a paragraph or
a h1 or something like that and

87
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.800
that'll have a lot of top margin
that will look a little goofy.

88
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.810
So I'm just gonna target
any first-child inside

89
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.370
of our preview and
just set the margin top to zero.

90
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.946
And finally, to make this easy to target
if, if someone wants to override it via

91
00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:28.340
theme ui, we're going to set a variant,
and we'll just call it react live.

92
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.934
So now it's targetable in theme

93
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:36.200
ui without having to mess with
this particular component.

94
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.140
So that is actually all that's
required to get this running.

95
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.140
So to test it out, let's start the server.

96
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.361
So we'll do yarn workspace
theme-dev develop.

97
00:06:53.367 --> 00:06:57.539
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And we'll just check
at the beginning that it didn't break

98
00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:58.380
anything.

99
00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.510
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, successful.

100
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.250
Okay.

101
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.120
And it's working.

102
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.570
We've got our syntax highlighted blog,
we've got our plain old blog,

103
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.730
and now I want to add a live edited blog.

104
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:18.220
So let's jump in here and

105
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.840
we're gonna open up the theme
dev docs index again,

106
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.070
and I'm gonna drop in some JSX and

107
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.700
I want to market as react live.

108
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.280
So this is going to be our live editor.

109
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.900
And to make things simple,

110
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.170
I'm just going to export a component
that component is gonna have a divinate.

111
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.710
We will add an h2.

112
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:54.030
We'll say, a button and
then let's also add that button.

113
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.553
We'll give it an on click handler and
because we're not writing a real button,

114
00:07:58.553 --> 00:08:02.889
we'll just make sure it tells us that
something happened when you click it.

115
00:08:08.056 --> 00:08:11.060
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,
so we've got our button.

116
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.454
We have exploited some jsx from our react
live and so what should happen is when I

117
00:08:15.454 --> 00:08:19.649
flip over to the page, we should be
looking at not only a syntax highlighted

118
00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:24.071
block with this code in it, but also
a working preview so let's give it a shot.

119
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.160
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Hey, look at that.

120
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.256
And now if I want to edit it,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We

121
00:08:33.256 --> 00:08:36.880
can make those edits in real-time and
they just work.

122
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.680
So this is an extremely powerful way for

123
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.090
us to tap into
the interactivity of a page.

124
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.310
And because we put this in a theme,

125
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.130
it's going to just work when
you install this on a site.

126
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.560
So anyone who wants to use this theme
will be able to add that react live

127
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.850
attribute to their code blocks, and
get a live preview, editable live preview.

128
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:05.540
So, with that being said, I think
we're good to call our theme finished.

129
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.250
So let's add everything,
check where we are.

130
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.670
So we added the React live dependency,

131
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.820
set up the code component to use it set up
scope so that we can easily shadow what

132
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.390
components are available in React live and
then modified index.mdx to use it.

133
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.636
So let's commit that change.

134
00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:30.520
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Add
live editing support.

135
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.675
Okay, we'll push that up.
