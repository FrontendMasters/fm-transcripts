00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.290
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: The next thing we
wanna do is take our pretty bare bones,

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.166
unstyled theme and give it some
base styles, and give it some hook.

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:12.610
So that people who'll use the theme
are able to override those styles, and

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.340
make it look like theirs.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.840
So let's go ahead and
install what we need here.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.800
So we'll start in
the gatsby-theme-docs workspace.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.611
And we will add, we're gonna add theme-UI.

8
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:33.124
We're gonna add gatsby-plugin-theme-UI.

9
00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:36.350
And then there are a couple
dependencies under the hood here.

10
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.690
The first one is emotion/core.

11
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.858
And then we also need mdx-js/react.

12
00:00:46.858 --> 00:00:50.010
Now we've already installed mdx-js/react.

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.230
I'm just installing it as part of this to
show the full suite of dependencies in

14
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.840
case anybody skipped ahead.

15
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.080
But it doesn't hurt to run it again.

16
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.715
So, once we've got this in,
we can go into our gatsby-config and

17
00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:10.508
we can just drop in gatsby-theme, or

18
00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:15.510
gatsby-plugin, sorry, plugin-theme-ui.

19
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.160
And so we can see in our package.json,

20
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.590
we've got the gatsby-plugin-theme-UI,
and its dependencies.

21
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.970
And our gatsby-config,
we've got gatsby-plugin-theme-UI.

22
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.300
And what this will do is it'll wrap the
output of the site in a theme provider, so

23
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.750
that different parts of our site
are able to actually access that theme.

24
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.040
To make this actually work,
let's go in and modify a couple things.

25
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.620
So the first thing we wanna do is
let's get our layout to look nice.

26
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:53.460
And I'm gonna do that by first, I wanna
be able to use the theme UI shortcuts.

27
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.954
It has a prop,
like a convenience prop called SX,

28
00:01:57.954 --> 00:02:02.452
which lets us access
the theme UI props and stuff.

29
00:02:02.452 --> 00:02:06.344
But to do that,
we have to change the pragma.

30
00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:11.470
A pragma for those of you who
aren't familiar with it is

31
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.170
the way that React magically recognizes
JSX and turns it into content.

32
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.540
It's why React has to be in Scope when you

33
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.080
create a component even if you don't ever
actually reference the React import.

34
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.160
So if we change our pragma,
we no longer need React and

35
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.090
Scope because we're providing a new
create element function that will do

36
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.400
basically all the same things that React
does, but it adds extra functionality.

37
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.270
In this case we're adding support for
that SX prop.

38
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.950
So to do that,
I'm going to change our pragma to JSX.

39
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.058
And then down here, I'm going

40
00:02:53.058 --> 00:02:57.579
to import JSX from Beam UI.

41
00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.029
And then because we don't
need React anymore,

42
00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.490
I'm just gonna swap this
out to fragment only.

43
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.859
And we'll just simplify down like that.

44
00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.614
And I'm using fragments so
that we don't get like empty wrapper divs.

45
00:03:11.614 --> 00:03:15.268
Fragment kind of compiles away and
doesn't become actual markup,

46
00:03:15.268 --> 00:03:17.959
which keeps our websites
a little more semantic,

47
00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.690
a little bit easier to reason about
if you're looking at the source.

48
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.370
So, now that we've got
this pragma in here,

49
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.200
what we can do is we can
start adding some styles.

50
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.940
And so the first thing that I
wanna add is I'm just gonna add

51
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.690
this SX prop to my header.

52
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.981
And I wanna set the background.

53
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:44.562
And so one of the things that's a little
tricky at first about theme-UI,

54
00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:47.104
and then wonderful is that
it has shortcut methods so

55
00:03:47.104 --> 00:03:50.070
that you don't have to type out
really long property names.

56
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.100
So instead of typing out background,
I can just type bg.

57
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.807
And I want the background of my header
to be the primary color on my site.

58
00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:02.610
And we haven't defined these colors yet,
so don't worry.

59
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.818
We'll get to that in a second.

60
00:04:04.818 --> 00:04:09.250
I want the color of my header to be
the background color of the site.

61
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.210
I want the font family to
be the heading font family.

62
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.089
And I wanna set the padding,
and because it's a common one,

63
00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.065
there's a shortcut,
we can set the padding.

64
00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:24.452
I want the padding to be three.

65
00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:30.384
So I can set that and we can see here
that it's just on the header as a prop,

66
00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:35.362
and this is a theme-UI shortcut for
like theme-UI styles.

67
00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:38.490
Then on the main,
I'm gonna add a few things as well.

68
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.800
So I want to set this one to be,
I only want the margin left and

69
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.960
right to be auto so
that it centers in the screen.

70
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.270
But there's a shortcut for that as well.

71
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.878
We can do margin x or left, right,
and I'm gonna set that to auto.

72
00:04:52.878 --> 00:04:57.310
I'm gonna set the maxWidth to 650 pixels.

73
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.400
I'm gonna set the width to 90, or

74
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.930
90 view port width units I
think is what that's short for.

75
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.140
And that'll prevent it from getting
squished up against the sides on small

76
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.700
view ports.
