00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.128
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Before this is really
gonna do anything useful we need to

2
00:00:02.128 --> 00:00:03.548
actually set these colors, right.

3
00:00:03.548 --> 00:00:06.377
And this is where we get
into component shadowing.

4
00:00:06.377 --> 00:00:10.524
So component shadowing in
Gatsby is a method for

5
00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:14.783
us to override a file in another theme or
plugin.

6
00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:18.603
Without actually needing to
modify the source code, or

7
00:00:18.603 --> 00:00:22.273
dive into node modules, or
fully eject all the code.

8
00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:26.526
So we can just pick one thing
that we want to change and

9
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:30.014
change it and
the plugin will pick that up.

10
00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:35.867
So to do that the way that it works is we
can target the plugin we want to change so

11
00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:38.312
gatsby-plugin-theme-ui.

12
00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:42.360
And then inside of that we get
access to its whole source folder.

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.103
So theme UI is set up where they
put the theme just at the root so

14
00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:48.788
we can do index.js.

15
00:00:48.788 --> 00:00:54.263
And to set up a style object
we just export an object.

16
00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:55.815
And there are some keys.

17
00:00:55.815 --> 00:01:02.434
There's a whole Theme UI spec that
we can look at on theme-ui.com.

18
00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:07.120
I'm not gonna get deep into this, but if
we look at the spec we can see that there

19
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.614
are colors, fonts, font sizes,
a whole bunch of things that you can set.

20
00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:15.068
And if you follow this spec
the nice thing about it is that

21
00:01:15.068 --> 00:01:19.271
any theme following the Theme UI
spec will respect these settings.

22
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:25.225
So if I set a primary color any site using
Theme UI will respect that primary color.

23
00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:29.893
And so if my site exports a theme object
all of the themes using Theme UI that

24
00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:34.410
are installed on my site will pick up
the settings from my Theme UI object

25
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.511
without me having to change
anything in the themes themselves.

26
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:41.298
So this is really, really handy for us.

27
00:01:41.298 --> 00:01:43.589
And I'm just gonna set
up some colors to start.

28
00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:48.427
So let's set up a primary color, we’ll
make it rebeccapurple because this is

29
00:01:48.427 --> 00:01:52.255
a Gatsby site and Gatsby uses
rebeccapurple as a brand color.

30
00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:56.832
We’ll do secondary of indigo,

31
00:01:56.832 --> 00:02:01.747
we can set up a muted color of gray,

32
00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:05.826
a text color of purple and a.

33
00:02:10.224 --> 00:02:14.098
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Background of white.

34
00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:15.644
And that’s good enough to get us started.

35
00:02:15.644 --> 00:02:18.344
So let's just start the site here.

36
00:02:18.344 --> 00:02:24.303
We'll do yarn workspace theme-dev develop.

37
00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:30.051
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
once this gets up and

38
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:33.146
running we can see that
it picked up our colors.
