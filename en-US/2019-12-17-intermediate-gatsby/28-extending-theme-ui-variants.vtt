00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.610
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: What
we want to do next,

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.790
now that we've got our site, it's showing
pictures, we've got some content.

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.550
But we want to add more, right?

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.820
I want to get recipes on here.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.610
I want to be able to check out
different ways to riff on the Negroni.

6
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.320
And to do that we're going
to use our docs name

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.470
because recipes are a form
of documentation.

8
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.880
So let's, we'll shave some corners of that
square peg and get it into the round hole.

9
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.830
So the way that we're gonna do that is we
will go ahead and start by installing it.

10
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.922
So we're gonna yarn
workspace negronis add.

11
00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:43.262
And then we're gonna quote it since
we're installing a work space theme.

12
00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:52.410
Gatsby-theme-docs@ star and
once we get this in,

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.710
we'll get into the config and
we're gonna install it with some options.

14
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.540
So first,
we'll resolve gatsby-themed-docs and

15
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.790
in the options I want to change
the base path to be recipes and

16
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.140
I also want to set the content path cuz I
already have some recipes defined in here.

17
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.351
So they're in content recipes so

18
00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:26.441
we'll set that to be the content path,
content recipes okay?

19
00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:32.940
Once this is configured,
then we can do a couple things.

20
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.580
So the first thing is just
like in the honck if I say,

21
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.670
we wanna pull the layout out of our
site and use it in the docs name.

22
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.680
So I'm going to create
Gatsby theme docks and

23
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.260
then I'm going to get into
components we'll create a layout.js.

24
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.711
And I'm gonna import Layout

25
00:01:55.711 --> 00:02:00.164
from components/Layout.

26
00:02:00.164 --> 00:02:05.877
And then export default,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Layout.

27
00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:13.570
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then, let's
just take a look and see how that goes.

28
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.779
So we'll do yarn workspace
negronis develop.

29
00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:28.552
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And once we get this
started, what we should see is we've got

30
00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:33.667
four recipes in here and
one of them is at index.MDX, which means,

31
00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:38.455
according to our config,
I should be able to visit /recipes.

32
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.140
So let's take a look.

33
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.930
Okay, all right, this is good.

34
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.760
So we can see a couple issues
right out of the gate.

35
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.970
So one, is that this is not the right
color that's not going to work for us.

36
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.505
So there's not nearly enough contrast for
that to be legible.

37
00:02:57.505 --> 00:02:59.980
And then this doesn't
really make sense either.

38
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.880
So we want to change out that text.

39
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.115
And so I actually purposely designed
this component poorly, because what

40
00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:13.179
you could do is you could add a Props or
you could parse in different text,

41
00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:17.851
you could separate the heading
from the table of contents itself.

42
00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:22.170
But I wanted to show just a quick
way to override some components.

43
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.300
So what we're gonna do
is go into our theme and

44
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.705
I'm just gonna grab this table-of-contents
I'm gonna copy the whole thing.

45
00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:38.350
And then I'm gonna come back down,
go into Gatsby theme docs components.

46
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.570
And I'm gonna create
a table of contents gas.

47
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.031
And I can paste it in.

48
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:49.786
And then I'm going to change
it to say all recipes.

49
00:03:53.986 --> 00:03:56.620
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
that's all I need to change.

50
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.014
So, if I stop and restart this
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Whenever

51
00:04:03.014 --> 00:04:06.621
you shadow a component, you have to stop
and restart to get Gatsby to pick that up,

52
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.840
so that's why we're turning it on and
off again.

53
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.740
And now basically I just copy pasted the
got to that component made a quick change

54
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.250
their ways to abstract it better.

55
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.070
There are ways to make that configurable
through the data layer where we were

56
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.860
maybe pulling like an option out of the
data layer and using that as the title.

57
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.600
But this is like the.

58
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.130
The most straightforward way is just take
the component exactly as is make whatever

59
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.030
changes but it's worth noting, we've
now rejected if things change upstream,

60
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.400
we would need to go and get those
changes and migrate them back in.

61
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.825
So this is the heaviest way of solving
this problem is a full copy paste

62
00:04:44.825 --> 00:04:49.243
of the component
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Then,

63
00:04:49.243 --> 00:04:51.524
now that we've got this in here,

64
00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:57.160
the other thing that I wanna do is I want
to add a link to it on the homepage.

65
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.250
So let's go to this homepage.

66
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.010
And I've got our history here.

67
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.468
I'm gonna change this over to be recipes,

68
00:05:09.468 --> 00:05:13.380
and we'll say see recipes.

69
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.171
Okay, so I see a couple issues here, the
first one is our buttons are smashes into

70
00:05:18.171 --> 00:05:21.110
each other, so we can solve that easily.

71
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.180
We'll just add a little bit of
left hand margin, okay cool,

72
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.550
that problem's solve, but
I want to add visual hierarchy here.

73
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.580
I want the recipes to be
the thing that people look at.

74
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.980
So I want that to be kind of
a primary standout button.

75
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.520
So to do that, I'm gonna add
a different variant called primary.

76
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.590
And I can get into my
Gatsby plugin theme UI.

77
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.333
And what I'm gonna do for

78
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:54.746
the sake of experience here is
I'm going to just duplicate it.

79
00:05:54.746 --> 00:05:57.390
But a lot of these setting
aren't gonna change.

80
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.157
So, in your app you'll probably
want to abstract out common

81
00:06:02.157 --> 00:06:06.176
button stuff in like a common button,
object, but

82
00:06:06.176 --> 00:06:11.036
I don't wanna make everybody
watch me refactor an object, so

83
00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:15.997
just know that that's probably
something you would wanna do.

84
00:06:15.997 --> 00:06:19.079
So then, let's see,
we want that to be the primary and

85
00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:21.230
we'll set this to be the background.

86
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.080
And then I think we just want like, when
we focus will use the secondary color and

87
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.760
when we hover will use
the secondary color.

88
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.240
And I think that's gonna
be all we need to change.

89
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.150
So let's take a look.

90
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.162
Yeah, that's good enough, right?

91
00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:41.240
So that's still visible.

92
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.115
It's clearly kind of got more visual
weight than the history button, and

93
00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:47.932
that will take us through.

94
00:06:47.932 --> 00:06:53.600
So let's fix this muted color,
make that a little more visible.

95
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.408
So, to do that,
I can just go in here we'll do colors.

96
00:06:59.408 --> 00:07:03.120
We could solve this with like
a low dash merge as well.

97
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.080
To make this a little less gross,
but I think it's okay for now.

98
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.810
So we'll just do,
let's say 555, how's that work?

99
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.000
That's much better.

100
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.550
So now we've kind of overwritten this.

101
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.400
We've made our text a little more legible,
we've got a functioning site,

102
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.250
and you'd never know that this was
originally intended to be documentation.

103
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:33.740
It just works with the style of
recipe that we've put in here.

104
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.330
So this is really nice, right?

105
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.480
We've got the theme installed,
and up and running, and

106
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.490
customized, in just a few files,
a couple tweaks to our styles.
