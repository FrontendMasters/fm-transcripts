&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Beyond just
the surface level building static sites,

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.200
Gatsby has tons of advanced features.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.535
So one of the things that we're gonna
talk about today is theming and

4
00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:10.430
theme composition.

5
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.025
You can write up bundled functionality and
styles and

6
00:00:15.025 --> 00:00:19.720
plugins and configuration for Gatsby, put
that into a theme and then install that

7
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.370
into a site as if it was a plugin,
and you'll get all that functionality.

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.030
Then you can install another
theme next to that theme,

9
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.310
and they just work with each other.

10
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.560
They're not competing,
they're not gonna, fight over things.

11
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.160
That does require building your themes
well, but we're gonna do that today,

12
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.710
so don't you worry about that.

13
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.610
You can also build custom data sources.

14
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.610
You can get data from anywhere, if you've
got an in house API, you can build

15
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.370
a Gatsby source plugin that will pull that
in and make it part of the GraphQL API.

16
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.410
We're not gonna build
a custom data source but

17
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.040
we are going to do Schema customization.

18
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.980
So that covers most of
the basics of sourcing data.

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.420
We're gonna combine build time and
run time data so

20
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.410
you can get a lot of the data,
anything that doesn't change frequently.

21
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.770
Put it together at build time, so
that the site has that available and

22
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.280
will work offline and loads very quickly.

23
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.340
And then things that change frequently
like if you've got inventory, or

24
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.070
if you were running
something like a stock app

25
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.640
that needed to change prices
every couple of seconds.

26
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.070
You wouldn't be able to rebuild
your site every couple of seconds.

27
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.730
So you can get that client side and
just update and you can do that with any

28
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.280
pattern that you want skeleton patterns,
spinners, whatever.

29
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.600
Schema customization and custom data types
allows you to overcome a couple problems.

30
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.190
One is if the data is empty,
like if you're using the file system and

31
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.180
there are no files, Gatsby would
say you're missing this field.

32
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.980
Because there was no data
to make that field exist.

33
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.350
By creating custom data types
we can avoid those errors.

34
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.910
So we actually get empty sets back and
you can do things like.

35
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.880
In advanced cases,
you could say I wanna have a page.

36
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.490
And my page could come from Markdown.

37
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.310
Or it could come from WordPress, or
it could come from Contentful or

38
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.640
any other number of places,
but I just wanna query pages.

39
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.300
So with schema customization and
custom data types, you can

40
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.290
actually pull data from all of those
sources and put them into one bucket.

41
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.910
We're not gonna get into that today.

42
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.870
But we are gonna get into schema
customization for a single source.

43
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.280
And really the the underlying message
here is that anything that React can do,

44
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.870
Gatsby can most likely handle.

45
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.210
Gatsby is, at the end of the day, a nice
package for serving React apps, which

46
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.470
means that React apps are just React apps
you can do almost all of the same things.

47
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.310
There are very few restrictions and almost
all of those have escape hatches and

48
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.030
controls and
we'll look at some of that works today.
