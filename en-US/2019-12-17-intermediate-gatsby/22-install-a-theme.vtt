1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.530
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: At this point,
I wanna jump into a real site.

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.280
I wanna jump into a working site.

3
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.960
So we're going to open
up the Honkify site.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.164
And that will already
be installed in your,

5
00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:17.041
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Code editor here, so

6
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.386
we can just close up the packages.

7
00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.010
We're gonna be working in Honkify.

8
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.409
So just take a look at it.

9
00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.007
It's got an index.mdx, so
it's already using mdx.

10
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:30.900
And let's just boot it up and
take a look, yeah?

11
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.069
So we do yarn workspace honkify develop

12
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.588
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, so

13
00:00:49.588 --> 00:00:54.760
we've got a marketing page for
our library.

14
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.980
This is a very important, very useful
JavaScript library that I would encourage

15
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.890
all of you to install today.

16
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.320
What it does is when you turn it on,

17
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.980
it will make sure that your browser
honks instead of following links.

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.350
I wanna add documentation to this site.

19
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.490
So I've built a library.

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.167
I've got a homepage.

21
00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:16.807
Everybody loves it, everybody wants to
use it, but we haven't added docs yet.

22
00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:19.163
So I don't wanna have to
reinvent docs from scratch.

23
00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:20.830
I wanna install a theme.

24
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.880
So what I can do is I can
just install this theme.

25
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.620
So we're going to stop the server.

26
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.481
And I will install the theme using

27
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:38.828
yarn workspace honkify add.

28
00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:43.758
And then because we're installing a local
theme, I'm gonna put it in quotes,

29
00:01:43.758 --> 00:01:45.902
"gatsby-theme-docs@*".

30
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.531
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, all good.

31
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:59.980
Then I'm going to actually
configure it in my gatsby config.

32
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.010
And so to do that,
I'm just gonna go down and

33
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.640
we'll stick it right above
gatsby plugin theme UI.

34
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.560
Order shouldn't matter here.

35
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.120
I didn't test it.

36
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.050
And I'm not gonna tempt fate.

37
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.720
So let's put it where I put it last time.

38
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.220
We're going to install it here.

39
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.330
We're going to set some options on
the theme this time because we already

40
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.790
have a homepage, right?

41
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.420
So we want our docs to live at slash docs,
not at like the root of the site.

42
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.480
So I'm gonna set a base path of docs.

43
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.340
And I'm gonna deal with
with a leading slash there.

44
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.485
And then because we already
have MDX installed,

45
00:02:40.485 --> 00:02:43.562
I'm gonna say that I do
wanna use external MDX.

46
00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:52.964
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And once that is
installed, what I can do is let's see.

47
00:02:58.252 --> 00:02:59.480
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's just
start it up and see how it goes.

48
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.140
So yarn workspace honkify develop.

49
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.450
And in honkify, we've already got.

50
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.340
To avoid having to
create a bunch of files,

51
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.449
I just created some empty docs
files here for us to work with.

52
00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:20.782
And looks like something broke.

53
00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:30.812
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I missed a comma.

54
00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:36.052
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Try that one
more time with the comma in place.

55
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.150
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,
the site's running.

56
00:03:45.538 --> 00:03:46.237
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: No errors.

57
00:03:49.036 --> 00:03:51.744
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, and so
if we come out here and we look,

58
00:03:51.744 --> 00:03:55.569
nothing is visibly changed, but
what happens if I go to Docs?

59
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.890
And I didn't create an index page.

60
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.050
So let's go to doc/installation.

61
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.250
Okay, so our theme works,
but it's not quite right.

62
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.748
It's picking up the colors but
it's not picking up the theme.

63
00:04:13.748 --> 00:04:18.580
So we're gonna use component shadowing
to tell the Docs theme to use

64
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.459
the layout from honkify.

65
00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.827
So let's hop in here and
in the source folder,

66
00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:32.115
I'm going to create a new file and
it's gonna live in gatsby-theme-docs.

67
00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:34.910
And once we go into gatsby-theme-docs,
again,

68
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.395
what we're doing when you're component
shadowing is by targeting this folder,

69
00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:43.150
we get access to the full source
folder inside of the theme.

70
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.910
So we don't include the source.

71
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.840
We just go straight into
whatever's in there.

72
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.940
So we wanna get at the components.

73
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.370
And I wanna change layout.js.

74
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.930
So now, what will happen is
when I restart the server,

75
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.900
the docs theme is gonna pick up this file.

76
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.870
So if I did it right now, it would fail
because it's not a react component.

77
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.834
So what I'm gonna do instead is
I'm gonna import layout from,

78
00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:12.371
let's get up the tree here, and
I'm gonna get components/layout.

79
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:16.520
And then I'm going to
export default layout.

80
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.040
So effectively what I've
just done is I've said, hey,

81
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.200
docs theme,
use this layout component instead.

82
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.924
And so it will replace that for us.

83
00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:27.948
So let's make that happen.

84
00:05:33.997 --> 00:05:36.252
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
upon getting started up,

85
00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:40.399
what we should see when we
refresh the page is that now,

86
00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:45.625
our docs still work but
they've picked up the layer from our site.

87
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:49.485
So without having to make any
changes to the theme itself,

88
00:05:49.485 --> 00:05:53.025
our theme files now look like
they belong on this site.

89
00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:57.140
And when we move around, it looks
like it's all part of the same site.

90
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.290
So this is where we start to
see the power of gatsby themes.

91
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.630
We did, what eight lines of code and

92
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.640
we've got a fully functional doc section
on the site now that we built it.

93
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.360
That's a really powerful model that gives
us a lot of power when we get into it.

94
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.495
The next thing that we wanna do is I want
to be able to use this button, right?

95
00:06:18.495 --> 00:06:22.865
We've got this button I wanna be able
to use that in a live editable region.

96
00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:27.262
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to create a scope.js and

97
00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:32.221
now we're gonna overriding that
scope.js inside of the theme.

98
00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:36.511
And I can import the button

99
00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:41.192
from components/button.

100
00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.677
And then I'm gonna export default.

101
00:06:42.677 --> 00:06:44.899
And I just want the button
to be available.

102
00:06:47.688 --> 00:06:54.328
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And to test this,
let's stop and restart.

103
00:06:54.328 --> 00:06:58.752
And I'm gonna go into the docs and

104
00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:03.185
let's add in an editable block.

105
00:07:03.185 --> 00:07:09.248
So we're gonna setup jsx,
make it react-live and

106
00:07:09.248 --> 00:07:12.638
I want to export a function.

107
00:07:12.638 --> 00:07:16.405
So I'm gonna write a custom
click handler for it.

108
00:07:16.405 --> 00:07:18.019
And that will just be that
alert that we did before.

109
00:07:20.783 --> 00:07:25.741
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
we will return a fragment

110
00:07:25.741 --> 00:07:29.877
that's got a heading.

111
00:07:29.877 --> 00:07:34.090
And then we will use our button.

112
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.110
So we're not importing the button,
we already put it in the scope.

113
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.520
That means that we can use it.

114
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.240
So I'm gonna set up some text.

115
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.430
Our text is gonna be honk.

116
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.100
And the onClick is going to be our handle
click function that we just wrote.

117
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:54.700
Okay, so, assuming all has gone well,
when I save this, get back out.

118
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.020
I forgot to close my fragment.

119
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.530
But we can see here,
it caught that for us.

120
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.480
It told us that we screwed it up, right?

121
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.730
So now, once I close this up,
come back out here.

122
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.571
There we go.
Okay, so it clicks.

123
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:17.918
And what's even more fun is if we
activate honkify, [SOUND] it works.

124
00:08:17.918 --> 00:08:19.607
It interacts with the page, right?

125
00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:24.395
So this is a really, really nice way
to set up interactive examples and

126
00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:30.400
allow people to play so that they can see
how things work in real time and edit.

127
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.887
And I think the last thing that
we need to do, [SOUND] whoops.

128
00:08:34.887 --> 00:08:38.900
[LAUGH] Is we just need
to add a link to it.

129
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:45.815
So if we go into our pages, we can just
duplicate this and say, read the docs.

130
00:08:45.815 --> 00:08:50.430
And we'll just skip right
through to that installation.

131
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.150
So now on our homepage,
we've got a link to the docs.

132
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.240
And in what, took like five, ten minutes.

133
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.084
We just set up an entirely new doc section
on an existing site that looks like it

134
00:09:04.084 --> 00:09:05.511
belongs on this site.

135
00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:09.411
And so I think this is where you start
to see the power of gatsby themes and

136
00:09:09.411 --> 00:09:11.817
why there's such a powerful abstraction.

137
00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:16.119
Cuz we did all of that pain of setting
up the config and diving through

138
00:09:16.119 --> 00:09:21.501
the GraphQL Schema customization, and
making sure that the docs folders created.

139
00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:27.430
All that work, and the end result is we
get plug-and-play drop in stuff like this.

140
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.560
It's really really nice experience when
you start using the theme as opposed to

141
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.470
building it.

142
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.740
So let's save our work.

143
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.989
And then, I wanna see how it feels to
create a new site using the theme.

144
00:09:39.989 --> 00:09:41.382
Where am I going, here we are.

145
00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:45.260
So we're gonna do a git add all.

146
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.620
Check the status.

147
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.270
And we've got our modified installation
instructions, we set up the theme,

148
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:59.480
installed the theme, shadowed the layout
and the scope, and updated the home page.

149
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:07.132
So let's commit
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,

150
00:10:07.132 --> 00:10:08.160
let's get that pushed up.
