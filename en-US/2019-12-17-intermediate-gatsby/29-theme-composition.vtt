00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:02.350
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I wanna show how
you can compose themes together and

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.880
use multiple themes on a site to get

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.880
a huge amount of utility
without a huge amount of work.

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.620
So there's a theme that I built
as part of a naked course,

5
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.880
it's called Gatsby theme events and
it allows you to supply

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.770
a yml file full of events and
display that on your site.

7
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.498
So I wanna be able to get these events
that we've got in content events,

8
00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:26.740
data.yml.

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.780
I want those to be available
on the site as a list.

10
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.717
So to do that,
we're going to yarn workspace negronies

11
00:00:36.717 --> 00:00:42.360
add jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-events.

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.580
So we'll get that installed and
then in our gastby-config,

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.260
we need to install that theme or
configure it.

14
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.100
So we're going to resolve
jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-events.

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.640
And then in the options,
we wanna change the basePath.

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.950
So the basePath for
this is gonna be events.

17
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.740
And then we want the contentPath

18
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.080
to go into that events folder
that we defined up here.

19
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.820
So we want it to find content events.

20
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.378
Once this is configured,

21
00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:23.940
we kinda wanna do the same thing
that we did with the docs theme.

22
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.020
So we're going to shadow the layout,
so jlengstoref and

23
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.440
note that the namespace on that
package might make it seem like

24
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.775
shadowing would be weird because
it creates extra folders,

25
00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:40.600
but it works exactly the same
is just an extra folder.

26
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.669
So we're gonna go
jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-events/components-

27
00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:48.115
/layout.js.

28
00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:51.984
And then in it,
I'm gonna import layout from,

29
00:01:51.984 --> 00:01:57.810
we've got three layers, one more,
to components, get that layout.

30
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.080
That's what I did wrong, that's confusing.

31
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.159
Then we're going to export default layout,
okay?

32
00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.550
And then we just need to link to it.

33
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.399
So let's go back to this index page.

34
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.128
And let's create one more button and
it'll be to

35
00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:24.232
the events page and
we'll just say Upcoming events.

36
00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:32.175
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yarn
workspace negronies

37
00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:35.764
develop
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And

38
00:02:35.764 --> 00:02:37.208
let's get this started.

39
00:02:56.362 --> 00:02:57.660
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,
we're up and running.

40
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.340
And so when we go back to our home page,
refresh and

41
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.810
we can see that we've
got our upcoming events.

42
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.190
And when we click through we've
got a list of our upcoming events

43
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.820
listed in the layout that we've created.

44
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.630
So this is, it looks nice,
it looks like it's doing what we want and

45
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.354
it took us two files, right?

46
00:03:21.354 --> 00:03:25.220
So, and this is kind of the the power
of what we're doing here.

47
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.020
We have two themes installed, and almost,
I mean, very little code happening.

48
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.398
We've basically defined our own layout.

49
00:03:34.398 --> 00:03:39.510
And a theme UI, and then we just drop that
layout into a couple different places.

50
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.400
And we've been able to build
an entire site out of it.

51
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.120
So it's very nice being able
to follow this pattern and

52
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.990
to be able to use this to build sites cuz
it just really accelerates development,

53
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.520
accelerates our ability to quickly
throw a new functionality.

54
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.900
And again, if you work at an agency or
something, or you're working in a company

55
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.450
that has lots of teams that are building
similar kind of landing pages,

56
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.830
you'll just start to find that a lot
of the things that you do over and

57
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.620
over again can be packaged
up into these themes.

58
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.090
And then pushed out in such a way
that you can stack together new sites

59
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.990
like Legos instead of having to build,
I've already built a homepage hero box

60
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.000
a thousand times,
I wish I didn't have to do that again.

61
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.410
Install the theme,
saw the hero theme and be done with it.
