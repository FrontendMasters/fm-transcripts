00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: This
is doing what we want.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.292
So we've got kind of a basic structure for
our site.

3
00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:06.905
We've got some clicks between.

4
00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:08.758
But I want this button to be
a little more noticeable.

5
00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:12.844
So I'm gonna use a variant in
Theme UI to set up a button style,

6
00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:16.020
because I wanna be able to access that.

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.644
So to do that,
I can jump into our Theme UI.

8
00:00:20.644 --> 00:00:24.800
And I'm just gonna define a button and
I want this to be a hollow button.

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.595
We don't wanna draw a ton
of attention to it.

10
00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:29.570
It's not like a call to action,
it's just a thing you can do.

11
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.670
And I'm gonna set the background
color to background.

12
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.500
And note,
this is just a regular style object.

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.560
The same way that you would do it
if you were using the SX prop,

14
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.060
you're gonna do it here as well.

15
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.602
So we're gonna do
the background of background.

16
00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:48.210
I'm gonna setup the border, will be theme,
and we'll set it to be like 2 px solid.

17
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.020
And let's add theme.colors.primary.

18
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.690
Then I can set the borderRadius to 10.

19
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.178
Let's set the color of
the text to primary color.

20
00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:08.200
I'm also gonna set
the display to inline-block.

21
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.250
Let's set the fontFamily to heading,
the fontWeight to bold.

22
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.707
I'll make this a really fancy button,
give it some padding.

23
00:01:19.707 --> 00:01:21.950
We'll take the textDecoration out.

24
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.976
Make sure that it doesn't get underlined,

25
00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:29.488
we're already calling attention
to it with the button outline.

26
00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:33.681
And then we're gonna even give
this some CSS transitions.

27
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.109
So I'm gonna set it up
to run 200 milliseconds,

28
00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.260
that's a good transition length.

29
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.861
We use linear because we're
gonna do color transitions, and

30
00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:44.225
in my experience that tends to be clean.

31
00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:47.381
This one it's done with a linear easing.

32
00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:50.573
And then finally, we wanna set up
some focus styles because again,

33
00:01:50.573 --> 00:01:51.583
we want that to work.

34
00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:53.260
And I didn't show that earlier.

35
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.400
So this is kinda what I'm talking about.

36
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.129
And you can see this one is styled,

37
00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:00.080
there's an outline that
shows up on my tab to it.

38
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.245
And it's nice and clean.

39
00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:04.260
It uses the same color.

40
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.290
It's offset from the text.

41
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.360
But if I tab down to this link by default,
it's highlighted, it's easy to see.

42
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.060
And so defaults aren't a bad thing.

43
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.853
You can leave the defaults in place.

44
00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:19.179
But if you really wanna make
it look kinda styled, and

45
00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:24.830
you wanna take control over the look,
never remove focus styles.

46
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.030
Never, never, never remove focus
styles unless you're replacing them.

47
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.150
So what we're doing is we're just
gonna make these more custom.

48
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.431
So my focus style here is going to
be a background color highlight.

49
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:43.457
I'm gonna use an outline and
we'll set that up to be 2px solid.

50
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.490
The theme colors.primary.

51
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.051
All right, and
then we'll set that outlineOffset to 2.

52
00:02:53.051 --> 00:02:56.678
And then we also want some hover
styles if you hover over it.

53
00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:59.200
So let's add a hover style.

54
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.058
And we'll just make the background
highlight, if you hover over this.

55
00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:06.220
Okay, so I've done this.

56
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.970
But we're not actually using it yet.

57
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.920
So the way that variance work is anything
that's at top level that's not a reserved

58
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.160
word, so like the colors or the fonts,
we can just define a theme.

59
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.640
And so if you wanted to you could
namespace this to your theme and you could

60
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.480
say, theme docs dot button dot primary or
something if you wanted to make that work.

61
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.760
In most sites, I've found that
the complexity doesn't get that high so

62
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.320
you can get away with just sensible names,
not necessarily heavily named space names.

63
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.550
Your mileage may vary depending
on the size of your team and

64
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.700
how many different people
are gonna touch it.

65
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.960
So to actually use this we can
go back out to this index and

66
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.310
I want to be able to set
this one to have a variant.

67
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.186
So I'm gonna set thES6 prop to variant.

68
00:03:58.186 --> 00:04:00.278
And then we just use dot notation.

69
00:04:00.278 --> 00:04:03.177
So button.hollow, okay?

70
00:04:03.177 --> 00:04:06.280
But in order for this to work,
we need to switch over to the JSX pragma.

71
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.819
So let me replace react up here with

72
00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.699
the JSX pragma from the theme-ui, okay?

73
00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.257
So we've got the JSX pragma and that
means that we have access to the sx prop.

74
00:04:23.257 --> 00:04:29.286
And all we've done is signify that this is
a hollow button, based on our variance.

75
00:04:29.286 --> 00:04:33.201
And assuming I didn't typo anything,
there we go, we've got a button and

76
00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:35.040
it picks up all the styles.

77
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.970
So when I start clicking around you
can see it now still shows an outline,

78
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.530
but that outline looks
a little more on brand.

79
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.227
So we want this to be very obvious.

80
00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:49.735
When you get into a button
the outline should be

81
00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:53.852
very noticeable because on a busy page
when somebody is tapping through they

82
00:04:53.852 --> 00:04:58.030
should know exactly what is currently
highlighted with their keyboard.

83
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.329
So this isn't like I don't think you
would submit that for designer works, but

84
00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:06.564
this can be really apparent to whoever
is keyboard tabbing through your site,

85
00:05:06.564 --> 00:05:09.407
that that is the button
that is currently selected.

86
00:05:09.407 --> 00:05:15.341
So from there,
I think we can save our work.

87
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:19.418
And then we'll move on to
further customizing this.

88
00:05:23.017 --> 00:05:27.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What was that
the button of variant?

89
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.540
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yeah,
so variant in Theme UI,

90
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.180
are just a way to give a name set of
styles, which makes them reuseable

91
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.970
without having to have an object that
you drop into the sx prop or something.

92
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.376
So yeah, we have set up the Theme UI and
gatsby config and

93
00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:44.274
install these dependencies.

94
00:05:44.274 --> 00:05:47.751
I wrote a layout file,
setup a custom theme and

95
00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:53.120
then rewrote the index and
history pages to use that layout.

96
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.790
So let's commit that.

97
00:05:58.375 --> 00:06:01.893
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Add Theme UI,
push it up.
