00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.966
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: The starter
has a few things in it so

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:05.351
that we don't have to write all
of the code from scratch, but for

3
00:00:05.351 --> 00:00:08.253
this first part,
we're gonna be developing a theme.

4
00:00:08.253 --> 00:00:13.907
And to develop themes in Gatsby,
we need something called yarn workspaces.

5
00:00:13.907 --> 00:00:18.520
So a yarn workspace is
a way that we are able to

6
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.653
work on two packages simultaneously.

7
00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:27.230
So typically speaking, if you're working
on a site if you wanna use a package,

8
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.808
you would yarn install the package name
and it goes into your package JSON and and

9
00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:33.196
then you can work on it.

10
00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:36.048
But if you wanna make
a change to that package,

11
00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:38.544
then you would have to publish it to NPM.

12
00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:42.518
And then reinstall it at
latest to get those changes.

13
00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:46.523
And that's really cumbersome and
we just don't wanna do that, right?

14
00:00:46.523 --> 00:00:50.832
So what yarn workspaces will let us do
is it lets us hook up a local folder as

15
00:00:50.832 --> 00:00:51.547
a package.

16
00:00:51.547 --> 00:00:54.581
So once you've got yarn workspaces set up,

17
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:58.522
we can set our theme as a package
that we can yarn install.

18
00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:02.725
But it will do it in a way that if we make
local modifications that will get picked

19
00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:05.094
up by the site that we're developing with.

20
00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:09.294
And that's important because
Gatsby themes are designed to take

21
00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:10.981
configuration options.

22
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:13.126
And that means that they
don't run standalone.

23
00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:16.190
They have to be installed by another
site in order to function properly.

24
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.527
So, what we're gonna do first is we

25
00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:25.742
are going to create a folder for
the theme.

26
00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:30.466
So I typically call this packages
because it's something that wouldn't be

27
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.507
done top level.

28
00:01:31.507 --> 00:01:32.957
You can call it whatever you want,

29
00:01:32.957 --> 00:01:35.213
there's not a hard and
fast naming convention here.

30
00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:40.210
This is just what I picked up,
you're welcome to do whatever you like.

31
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.140
And then I'm gonna use
the name of the package.

32
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.949
So we'll do gatsby-theme-docs.

33
00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:51.524
And inside of this, I'm gonna open
up my terminal and get into it.

34
00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:55.074
Let's go into packages, gatsby-theme-docs.

35
00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:57.695
And then I'm going to run yarn init.

36
00:01:57.695 --> 00:02:01.322
And what this will do is it's
gonna ask us some questions.

37
00:02:01.322 --> 00:02:03.325
So the name yes,
I wanted to be gatsby-themed-docs.

38
00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:06.608
And it's important to
remember that because that is

39
00:02:06.608 --> 00:02:08.557
what we're gonna have to use.

40
00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:11.242
Like we will do yarn workspace and
the name of the package.

41
00:02:11.242 --> 00:02:13.892
And an important note about Gatsby themes,

42
00:02:13.892 --> 00:02:16.832
the Gatsby theme at
the beginning is important.

43
00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:20.227
You have to name your theme
with Gatsby dash theme.

44
00:02:20.227 --> 00:02:23.600
That's part of how we work
the shadowing algorithm.

45
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.148
So when you're building a custom theme,
you always need to use Gatsby theme.

46
00:02:27.148 --> 00:02:32.001
Then we can keep the version default
we don't need a description.

47
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.508
The index.js entry point is fine.

48
00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:38.394
We'll skip that use default, okay?

49
00:02:38.394 --> 00:02:43.524
So once we have that,
when we look into our package Jason,

50
00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:47.621
we can see here that
we've got the theme docs.

51
00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:50.042
And that's gonna be
the name of our workspace.

52
00:02:50.042 --> 00:02:55.606
So to set up work spaces we're
gonna go out to the theme route,

53
00:02:55.606 --> 00:02:59.685
and we're going to create a package.json.

54
00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:02.665
And this one's a little
different from the average one.

55
00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:06.609
So first we're gonna set it to private
because it has to be private in order for

56
00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:07.957
workspaces to function.

57
00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:09.601
You can't publish a workspace.

58
00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:13.083
Then we're gonna set up workspaces,
which is an array.

59
00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:16.707
And we're gonna set this up
to read from two folders.

60
00:03:16.707 --> 00:03:19.527
The first one is gonna be
the packages folder because we

61
00:03:19.527 --> 00:03:22.235
wanna be able to use that
theme that we just created.

62
00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.251
And the second one is the site's folder.

63
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.427
So we've got a bunch of sites in here.

64
00:03:26.427 --> 00:03:29.996
So we're gonna say
anything inside of sites,

65
00:03:29.996 --> 00:03:32.839
you should also read as a workspace.

66
00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:37.877
Once we're in here,
then I can do yarn workspaces info.

67
00:03:37.877 --> 00:03:45.076
And what it'll show us is each of
these sites shows up as a package.

68
00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:46.460
It’ll show us where it lives.

69
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.846
Then, it’ll show us if we have
any workspace dependencies.

70
00:03:48.846 --> 00:03:50.722
We can see here at the beginning,

71
00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:53.812
none of these sites have
any workspace dependencies.

72
00:03:53.812 --> 00:03:56.293
Now, this one does, but
we’re not gonna worry about that,

73
00:03:56.293 --> 00:03:58.885
because it’s not really relevant
to what we’re doing today.

74
00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:02.561
And then we've got our gatsby-themed-docs,
which is set up in here properly.

75
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:07.567
So what we do need to figure out though,
is one thing that's

76
00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:12.778
important to know about packages
is that packages rely on this

77
00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:17.903
main folder to determine whether or
not the package exists.

78
00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:22.372
So when you install a package if you try
to use it, the first thing that node will

79
00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:27.046
do is it'll look into that name and make
sure that whatever the file is exists, and

80
00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:30.338
if it doesn't,
it'll say that the package is invalid.

81
00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:33.408
So we're not actually
gonna use an index js.

82
00:04:33.408 --> 00:04:37.707
So we're just gonna create it and
then make a little note so

83
00:04:37.707 --> 00:04:40.706
that people know that this is intended.

84
00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:43.370
It's kind of like this page
intentionally left blank sort of thing.

85
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.782
You can put whatever you want in there.

86
00:04:46.782 --> 00:04:50.748
I boop is like my standard silly comment.

87
00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:59.523
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Once this is set up,
now we can set up the theme dev site.

88
00:04:59.523 --> 00:05:03.466
So we're just gonna create a whole
new site inside of our site's folder,

89
00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:04.999
we'll call it theme-dev.

90
00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:09.817
And again,
we're gonna pull up the terminal,

91
00:05:09.817 --> 00:05:17.528
go into the,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Sites/theme-dev and

92
00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:19.912
then we will yarn init again.

93
00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:24.042
And this time we'll keep the name
theme-dev, keep the version,

94
00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:26.710
description, all that can stay the same.

95
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.877
But what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set
the private on this one to true because

96
00:05:31.877 --> 00:05:37.396
typically speaking, you don't wanna
publish a website as a package on npm net.

97
00:05:37.396 --> 00:05:39.952
You could, but there's not
really a good reason to do that.

98
00:05:39.952 --> 00:05:43.709
So then in here,
we're gonna have our package JSON and

99
00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:48.128
it's set to private so
that we don't accidentally publish it.

100
00:05:48.128 --> 00:05:51.940
In this, I can now add a few things.

101
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.976
In the end there's a small difference.

102
00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:59.449
Typically when you add packages in yarn or
NPM, you do NPM install or yarn add.

103
00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:00.749
So with workspaces,

104
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:04.658
we just prefix the ad with the name
of the workspace we wanna use.

105
00:06:04.658 --> 00:06:09.244
So I'm gonna say yarn workspace
theme-dev and then I'm gonna add.

106
00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.210
And now, I can just add whatever I want.

107
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.397
So I'll do gatsby react and react-dom.

108
00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:18.050
And we'll just check out in here
that this is gonna do what we want.

109
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.761
So it's installing
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay all right,

110
00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:27.066
so it showed up the way we expected.

111
00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:30.338
So now what we wanna do is
we wanna install our theme.

112
00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:33.773
yarn workspace theme-dev add, and

113
00:06:33.773 --> 00:06:38.106
then to quote it out for
Windows and SeaShell.

114
00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:42.964
We'll say gatsby-theme-docs @* and
@* just means that node

115
00:06:42.964 --> 00:06:47.483
will be okay with the fact that
it's not a published package.

116
00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:52.979
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So once we get that,
we'll see it pop up in our package JSON.

117
00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.329
And here we go.

118
00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:56.973
So now if I run yarn
workspaces info again.

119
00:06:56.973 --> 00:06:59.975
And this is where it should be portal.

120
00:06:59.975 --> 00:07:02.706
Then I can see if I look at our theme-dev,

121
00:07:02.706 --> 00:07:05.916
now we've got workspace
dependencies in here.

122
00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:10.306
And what this means is that
gatsby-theme-docs is being treated as

123
00:07:10.306 --> 00:07:14.935
a package it will work exactly the same
as a package installed from NPM.

124
00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:18.279
But the benefit now is that
it's using local file.

125
00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:23.036
So when I make changes to this
gatsby-themed-docs folder up

126
00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:24.682
here in the top left,

127
00:07:24.682 --> 00:07:30.454
that will reflect in the theme-dev site
as if it were downloaded from NPM.

128
00:07:30.454 --> 00:07:34.898
So, next we're going to
get into our theme-dev and

129
00:07:34.898 --> 00:07:38.036
we're going to install this theme.

130
00:07:38.036 --> 00:07:45.552
So let's just go ahead and
create a gatsby-config.js.

131
00:07:45.552 --> 00:07:49.729
This is gonna be kind of the heart
of any standard Gatsby site.

132
00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:54.359
So let me drop this down a little bit and

133
00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:58.270
we'll say module.exports and

134
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.778
that's going to be a config object.

135
00:08:02.778 --> 00:08:05.388
And inside of this we're
gonna have a plug-ins array.

136
00:08:05.388 --> 00:08:08.594
And the way that you install a theme in
Gatsby by default, if you wanna use all

137
00:08:08.594 --> 00:08:11.823
the default options and everything,
is you can just drop it right in there.

138
00:08:11.823 --> 00:08:16.859
So we're gonna say gatsby-theme,
if I can spell it, gatsby-theme-docs.

139
00:08:18.683 --> 00:08:22.631
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And upon saving this,
we are now effectively using this theme.

140
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:30.937
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
it won't do anything right now, but

141
00:08:30.937 --> 00:08:32.744
it won't explode if I start it.

142
00:08:32.744 --> 00:08:37.661
So I'm going to come in here, and
I'm just gonna add some scripts so

143
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:41.134
that we can start Gatsby
from the command line.

144
00:08:41.134 --> 00:08:43.051
So let's add a scripts key.

145
00:08:43.051 --> 00:08:50.135
And we'll put in develop, and our develop
command is gonna be gatsby develop.

146
00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:55.005
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So now, what I should
be able to do, and this is an empty site,

147
00:08:55.005 --> 00:08:56.904
so it's just gonna give us a 404.

148
00:08:56.904 --> 00:09:00.618
But I can do yarn workspace
theme-dev develop.

149
00:09:00.618 --> 00:09:02.648
And this should start our gatsby site

150
00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:11.687
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, so we're up and

151
00:09:11.687 --> 00:09:16.882
running and we can see now that it
exists so if I switch out to here.

152
00:09:16.882 --> 00:09:21.084
And run the page we can see that Gatsby
is running, we don't have any content or

153
00:09:21.084 --> 00:09:25.429
anything in herebBut it's doing what we
expect it is actually loading the page.

154
00:09:25.429 --> 00:09:28.077
So that puts us in a position
that we wanna be in,

155
00:09:28.077 --> 00:09:31.409
which is that we can start
actually developing on the site.

156
00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:33.760
So this is kind of
the workspace is set up.

157
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.402
That's that's where you for any theme-dev,
this is where you're gonna wanna start

158
00:09:38.402 --> 00:09:43.079
basically
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So let's go ahead and

159
00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:43.993
commit that.

160
00:09:43.993 --> 00:09:45.182
I'm gonna check out a new branch.

161
00:09:45.182 --> 00:09:48.365
So we'll do git check out branch.

162
00:09:48.365 --> 00:09:53.943
And we'll call this
fernan masters progress.

163
00:09:53.943 --> 00:10:02.572
And I'm going to check git status,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,

164
00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:04.219
and I'm just gonna add everything.

165
00:10:06.234 --> 00:10:08.291
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: This
shows is in our queue and

166
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:11.889
we've got a pack of json which is for
work spaces,

167
00:10:11.889 --> 00:10:16.875
then we've got our gatsby-theme-docs
the packages on the index.

168
00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:20.930
The gatsby-config and the package.json for
the theme dev site, and then a yarn.lock,

169
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.703
which is just tracking dependencies.

170
00:10:22.703 --> 00:10:25.131
So I'm going to go ahead and commit that.

171
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:28.116
And I'm gonna use conventional commits.

172
00:10:28.116 --> 00:10:33.279
So we'll say theme-dev,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Workspace setup.
