&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We're living in one
of the most exciting times as frontend

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:03.920
developers.

3
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.660
Because at the very beginning.,
like in the days of Netscape and

4
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.030
Internet Explorer.

5
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.769
You were able to just open up
a text file and write some HTML and

6
00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.657
you could put something on the Internet.

7
00:00:13.657 --> 00:00:15.870
And it was really, really approachable.

8
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.139
You had things like GeoCities that allowed
you to just get something up on the web.

9
00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:24.431
And then we wanted more power and we
started to see this complexity creep in.

10
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:28.718
JavaScript introduced a whole new level
of just stuff you had to manage and

11
00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:30.319
things that got hard to do.

12
00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:35.537
And that resulted in this explosion of
tooling, so jQuery kind of kicks off.

13
00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:37.817
Well, not really jQuery on its own, but

14
00:00:37.817 --> 00:00:41.118
a lot tools similar to jQuery
kicked off this revolution.

15
00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:43.112
In the way that we managed JavaScript.

16
00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:47.155
And then those kinda gave way
to bundlers Grunt and Gulp,

17
00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.522
moving on to Webpack and Parcel.

18
00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:52.743
Babbel unlocked this
whole new workflow and

19
00:00:52.743 --> 00:00:55.883
the ecosystem started to expand outward.

20
00:00:55.883 --> 00:00:59.298
And now what we're starting to see is
that the ecosystem is stabilizing enough

21
00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:01.590
that it's starting to contract again.

22
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.418
And with something like Gatsby and
with stuff like the JAMstack,

23
00:01:05.418 --> 00:01:08.633
what you're able to do is
basically open up a browser.

24
00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:13.222
And I run Gatsby new and
then I can just see it in the window.

25
00:01:13.222 --> 00:01:15.711
I can write some code and
I can see it in the browser.

26
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:19.834
And I can get it up in one command and
see the thing that I built on the Web.

27
00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:25.113
So even with all of that complexity,
we've started to hit a point.

28
00:01:25.113 --> 00:01:28.459
Where we get the ease of
getting something online.

29
00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.772
Of just opening up a text file and
writing some code and seeing it go live.

30
00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:35.809
But we get the power of all
of these new tools, and

31
00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:39.610
the decades of additional work
that's been done on the Web.

32
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.248
To make it more powerful and

33
00:01:41.248 --> 00:01:44.960
more capable of doing these
really incredible experiences.

34
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.620
And beyond that the platform is
just expanding to port so much.

35
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.820
And we've got access the JiroScope and
the phone.

36
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.100
We got access to the camera and
audio and light sensitivity.

37
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.430
And all these really cool things
that mean we can build really,

38
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.300
really powerful stuff in our browsers.

39
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.962
And we don't have to be hardcore,
know-everything developers.

40
00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:10.159
We can really just focus on
building a great experience and

41
00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.538
not worry about DevOps.

42
00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:17.421
Not worry about being a configuration
expert for WebPack and Babbel.

43
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:21.056
And I think it's a good time
to be a frontend developer and

44
00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:24.103
I think that it's getting
better all the time.

45
00:02:24.103 --> 00:02:26.585
So I'm really excited to see
what y'all go out and build.

46
00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:30.881
