00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.778
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's dive in and
and build this Negroni fan site, right?

2
00:00:04.778 --> 00:00:05.996
I'm really excited about this one.

3
00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:07.505
Negroni's my favorite drink.

4
00:00:07.505 --> 00:00:10.060
So they're a lot of fun.

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.590
And I think building the site
is also gonna be a lot of fun.

6
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.330
So let's close up these windows and
get into the Negroni site.

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.720
So, in our Negroni site,
we're gonna notice a couple things.

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.170
So first out of the gate,
we have a .environment file.

9
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.123
So we're gonna get into some advanced
stuff with environment variables.

10
00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:38.350
And also we're kind of
starting from scratch here.

11
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.410
So we've got the history
is just some text.

12
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.360
The index is just in text.

13
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.240
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: There
is no layout components.

14
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.660
So that's a typo on my part.

15
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.900
Forgive me.

16
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.887
So we've got our index file and
our history file,

17
00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:01.458
which we're just wrapping in fragments.

18
00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:03.529
We've got some images that
we're not using right now and

19
00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:06.380
then we've got some content
that we're not using right now.

20
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.105
So let's just take a look at what
this where our starting point is.

21
00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:16.100
We'll do yarn workspace negronis develop.

22
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.220
So now we've got this site built.

23
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.866
And if I go back to our homepage,

24
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:27.570
we have kind of a simple homepage,
a little bit of text and

25
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.582
then a link through to learn some history,
a light history.

26
00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:34.803
But again there's no content.

27
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:38.520
This is not a,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We need this

28
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.430
to do a lot, right?

29
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.790
So we need to install some themes.

30
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.284
We'll do yarn workspace negronis add, and

31
00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:51.264
we're gonna add gatsby-plugin-theme-ui,

32
00:01:51.264 --> 00:01:55.884
and that needs to come
along with theme-ui.

33
00:01:55.884 --> 00:02:02.721
It also needs to come along with
@emotion/core and @mdx=js/react.

34
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:06.364
And then because I don't wanna
have to write that whole object,

35
00:02:06.364 --> 00:02:09.479
I'm just gonna include
some @theme-ui/presets.

36
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.208
So that we can start with a theme
without having a right one ourselves.

37
00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.327
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: In our config
file to actually use this,

38
00:02:22.327 --> 00:02:27.763
let's set up modules.exports and
we will set up plugins.

39
00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:33.789
We're just gonna use
gatsby-plugin-theme-ui.

40
00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.262
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is this supposed
to be module the experts?

41
00:02:36.262 --> 00:02:37.375
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yes, it is.

42
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:40.333
That is gonna be the death of me today.

43
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:41.642
Thank you.

44
00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:45.277
So we've got module.exports and
then we've got our plugins array.

45
00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:48.850
And to start we're just gonna
use gatsby-plugin-theme-ui.

46
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.795
I then want to set up a theme.

47
00:02:54.795 --> 00:03:00.683
So let's go in here,
we'll do gatsby-plugin-theme-ui and

48
00:03:00.683 --> 00:03:05.487
we're gonna do an index
file to override the theme.

49
00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:09.079
And then I'm gonna
import the roboto theme.

50
00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.113
I'm gonna input it as theme so
that we don't have to rename it below.

51
00:03:14.113 --> 00:03:17.706
And we're gonna import that
from the theme-ui/presets.

52
00:03:19.317 --> 00:03:21.908
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
then I can export.default and

53
00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:25.039
just kinda drop the theme right in there.
