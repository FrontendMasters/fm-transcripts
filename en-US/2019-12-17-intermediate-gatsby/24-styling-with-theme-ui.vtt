00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.880
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Having done
very little, I’ve set up a theme.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.900
Now, nothing’s really gonna
happen if I restart the site

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.740
with this theme installed, because none
of the components are accessing any of

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.390
the default theme-ui stuff.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.160
So before we can really see it work,
we’re gonna add a layout file.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.678
So let's create components/layout.js,
and inside of this,

7
00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:25.714
we're gonna grab that JSX pragma from
theme-ui so that we can use the SX prop.

8
00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:30.375
And then I also want to get,

9
00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:35.851
we're gonna use global because

10
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.717
we wanna override a couple,

11
00:00:40.717 --> 00:00:47.760
basically just the margins and stuff.

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.100
And we're gonna override
that from @emotion/core.

13
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.600
We'll import link from gatsby because
we're gonna be linking to things.

14
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.210
And then because I don't wanna
add any junk in my output,

15
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.140
I'm also gonna import fragment from react,
because I want to be able to use that.

16
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.480
So let's define our layout.

17
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.650
And before I forget, let's make sure
that we export that as our default.

18
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.180
Okay.

19
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.180
So the layout's gonna
get children as a prop.

20
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.564
That's just anything that gets
passed inside that component.

21
00:01:23.564 --> 00:01:26.830
And we don't even need curly braces.

22
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.640
We're just gonna do a direct return.

23
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.030
We'll do a fragment.

24
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.010
And inside that fragment
we'll start out with global.

25
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.430
And we wanna set styles.

26
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.180
And so another thing that will
happen with the emotion core

27
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.540
global is that it also will accept the
theme object as an argument to a function.

28
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.180
So even though this isn't
technically part of theme-ui,

29
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.900
we can still get access to
that theme object and use it.

30
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.880
So let's do that and we will return,
I'm gonna do a couple things.

31
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.390
I don't think I would do this in a theme,

32
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.790
but since it's a site, I am happy to
make some sweeping proclamations here.

33
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.120
So I'm gonna say boxSizing
is gonna equal border-box.

34
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.430
That will give us some more predictability
around the way that things render.

35
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.685
I'm also going to say on the body
that I want the font family to equal

36
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:29.710
theme.fonts.body, so we're gonna
use the body font as the default.

37
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.920
I will set the font size to 20,
make it a little bigger, easier to read.

38
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.510
Then I'm going to set the margin to 0.

39
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.390
Underneath this, we need a header.

40
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.320
So for my header, I'm going to use
my standard pattern, which is to use

41
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.720
the primary color as the background and
the background color as the text color,

42
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.000
and then we'll give it a little bit
of padding so it's not all squished.

43
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.480
And inside of it,
we will do a link to the homepage and

44
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.929
give that a little bit of style.

45
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.130
So we'll say that the color is
going to be the background,

46
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.700
because it's a link it won't inherit
the header color by default.

47
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.000
We're also going to set
the fontweight to bold.

48
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.937
We want the text decoration to be none
because it's gonna be kind of a logo for

49
00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:24.160
the site.

50
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.810
And then I want to set on focus,
because we wanna make sure that it's

51
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.590
keyboard navigable, but we still want it
to look nice, like it's part of our theme.

52
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.110
So I'm gonna set the outline and
I'm gonna pull in this theme object.

53
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.420
And I want the outline to be 2px solid,
and I wanna use the theme color.

54
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.945
So let's use the background color for
the theme.

55
00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:50.871
And then because I don't want it
to be squished up on the link,

56
00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:53.072
I'm gonna do the outlineOffset.

57
00:03:53.072 --> 00:03:54.085
And we'll make that 4.

58
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.120
Okay, so then I can set the title.

59
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.020
We'll call this
the Negroni Appreciation Society.

60
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.720
If I can spell society right.

61
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.660
Okay, good good.

62
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.110
Then we need a main section, so
we just want this to not be squished, so

63
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.100
we'll set a vertical, so
the y-axis is up and down.

64
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.370
We'll set that margin to 4.

65
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.050
We'll set the left right margin to auto so
that it centers.

66
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.570
I'm gonna set a max width of 650 pixels,
and we'll set a width

67
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.230
of 90 vertical width units so
that it doesn't smash on smaller screens.

68
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.320
And inside we pass the children.

69
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.100
Okay, that's a layout component.

70
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.890
So now let's go use this layout component.

71
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.140
And we can do that by just jumping
into our pages and importing it.

72
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.130
And that'll be what we want to happen.

73
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.760
So let's go into our pages.

74
00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:03.280
I'm gonna import layout
from components/layout.

75
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.620
And then here, I can just use that.

76
00:05:08.763 --> 00:05:09.590
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, so that's one.

77
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.130
Do the same thing on this one.

78
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.767
Import layout from components/layout.

79
00:05:25.144 --> 00:05:26.023
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay.

80
00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:33.844
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's take a look,

81
00:05:33.844 --> 00:05:39.039
so yarn workspace negronis add,
no, develop.

82
00:05:50.158 --> 00:05:52.650
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Hey, hey, okay, so
this is looking a little bit better.
