00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.468
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Now that FX
prop is picking up what we want,

2
00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:05.017
it's doing the things
that we wanted to do.

3
00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:07.049
This is great,
this is exactly what we're after.

4
00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.566
But there are a couple weird things,
right?

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.806
Like we've got this margin and
that comes from the body.

6
00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:16.698
So if we wanna override that theme UI
isn't actually built to handle global

7
00:00:16.698 --> 00:00:17.328
styles.

8
00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:21.506
And this is something that you have to be
kinda careful about because if you add

9
00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:22.406
global styles,

10
00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:26.991
global styles can conflict one of the big
challenges of CSS is understanding scope.

11
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:29.588
And when you start putting
things in the global scope,

12
00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:32.764
it can become really challenging
as it scales out across the team.

13
00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:36.858
So you wanna be very sparing about
when you apply global styles.

14
00:00:36.858 --> 00:00:41.000
One thing that I think is kind of a
generally acceptable thing to do is remove

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.494
the body, margin and padding, so that
things can go to the edge of the viewport.

16
00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:51.624
So, to do that we're gonna
hop back into our layout and

17
00:00:51.624 --> 00:00:57.503
we're going to import
Global from emotion/core.

18
00:00:57.503 --> 00:01:02.782
And in emotion/core we're able to just
kind of define some global styles,

19
00:01:02.782 --> 00:01:04.352
which is really nice.

20
00:01:04.352 --> 00:01:09.118
So let's just do that,
I'm gonna do global styles.

21
00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:13.716
And I want to set the body
to have a margin of 0.

22
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.420
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
now it goes to the edge of the screen.

23
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.710
So again, use that sparingly, but it is a
handy way to fix things like body margin.
