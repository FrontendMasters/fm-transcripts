&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We're gonna finish
by giving you some time to work on

2
00:00:03.295 --> 00:00:04.187
exercise 8.

3
00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:09.626
Exercise 8, I want you to definitely
read the readme in it, but

4
00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:16.808
in exercise 8, the spirit of what you're
doing, let's open up that readme here.

5
00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:22.160
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The spirit of
what you're doing is to take out

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.504
all of that module design that
you did on app and UI and

7
00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:30.303
instead make these into objects that
can all virtually compose together.

8
00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:33.566
So we're gonna actually have
four different objects.

9
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:38.594
We're gonna have app, UI, helpers,
and the instance of our application.

10
00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:40.194
We're gonna have all four of those and

11
00:00:40.194 --> 00:00:42.299
they're going to virtually
delegate together.

12
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.074
And that means that we don't have any
like, calls where we have to in the app

13
00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:52.680
say UI dot, we're just gonna be able
to say, this dot and call a method.

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.310
And it will delegate to
the right context if we need it.

15
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.904
Definitely, strongly recommend that
you at some point spend some more time

16
00:01:01.904 --> 00:01:02.990
working on this.

17
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.282
Because it's one of the bigger, I think,

18
00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:07.829
one of the bigger payoffs
from the workshop is to

19
00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.180
fully understand now what delegation
gives us that even modules don't give us.
