00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.150
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Time for
another exercise.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.940
I want you to practice.

3
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.490
You're working on hoisting.

4
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.270
In particular, the suggestions and
the read me will tell you this.

5
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.522
But in particular, what you're looking for
is, do I need to rearrange my code so

6
00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:20.130
that my functions are at the bottom and
my executable codes at the top?

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.490
That sorta thing,
that's the spirit of the exercise.

8
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.397
Should just be a couple of lines
of code to be changed, but

9
00:00:25.397 --> 00:00:29.470
make sure you read through the read me and
address those points of improvement.

10
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.260
And we'll come back in a few minutes,
five to seven minutes, and

11
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.130
talk about the solution.
