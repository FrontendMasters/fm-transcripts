&gt;&gt; Kyle: The subject of EXERCISE 6 is for
you to go through the helper methods and

2
00:00:05.531 --> 00:00:11.335
instead of using helper's ".",
switch it to using this "." basically.

3
00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:16.217
In other words, apply what we just
learned with these findings to make it so

4
00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:18.910
that the helper methods are this aware.
