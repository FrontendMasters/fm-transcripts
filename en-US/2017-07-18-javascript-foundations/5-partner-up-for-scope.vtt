00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.719
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How do you feel so
far about this process of asking these

2
00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:07.702
questions of bam and where foo is?

3
00:00:07.702 --> 00:00:09.158
You feeling a little bit more confident?

4
00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:11.422
Let's test that out.

5
00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:15.518
For those of you that are here in person,
I want you to actually find somebody

6
00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:17.961
sitting next to you or
get up and walk around.

7
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.295
What you're gonna do is you're
gonna through this role playing.

8
00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:22.715
You're gonna walk through those steps.

9
00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:25.257
We'll go back a slide and
do without the strict mode.

10
00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:29.293
On this slide, you're gonna go through,
and you are going to play.

11
00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:34.423
One of you will play the scope manager and
other one of you will play the compiler,

12
00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:39.540
and then swap, and then also goes to
the run time and do both roles, okay?

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.318
And do it exactly like I just said.

14
00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:45.430
Hey, global scope, I have this LHS for
foo, ever heard of it do that exact thing.

15
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.600
Even though it sounds silly, we need
to make sure that you fully get it.

16
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.520
If you're watching this video at
a later time, go find a co-worker and

17
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.660
do the exercise with them, okay?

18
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.110
But actually do this because this
is how you get that ingrained,

19
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.520
that instinct of how the lexical
scope works, all right?

20
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.710
We'll take a few minutes, let you
practice that, and then we'll come back.
