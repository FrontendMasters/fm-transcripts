00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.749
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What questions came up
as a result of going through it with your

2
00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:05.201
neighbor, anything?

3
00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:10.242
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So we were having a back and
forth on line eight and nine about whether

4
00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:15.116
foo got dealt with at compile time or
was left to the second phase.

5
00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:18.704
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, which,
the foo on line eight is the question?

6
00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:19.433
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

7
00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:23.390
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, so the foo on line
eight does get dealt with at compile time

8
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.909
from the perspective of needing
to store that metadata,

9
00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.832
that it is in the LHS position.

10
00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:32.002
But foo on line 8 is not
creating a variable entry,

11
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:36.888
it's not making a marble and putting it
in a bucket, that happened on line 7.

12
00:00:36.888 --> 00:00:38.374
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

13
00:00:38.374 --> 00:00:39.879
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So it's kinda both.

14
00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:44.923
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What else?

15
00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:51.258
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there a good way of
accessing that line one from line four and

16
00:00:51.258 --> 00:00:51.895
a half?

17
00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:55.817
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: No, the only way to
access it is for a global variable you can

18
00:00:55.817 --> 00:01:00.700
use the cheat that global variables
are properties of the global object.

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.484
Which is generally frowned upon, but
if you really needed to you could do that.

20
00:01:04.484 --> 00:01:06.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So what's the best
practice if that's the case?

21
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.379
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Well
the best practice is,

22
00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:11.448
don't shadow if you're
gonna need access to it.

23
00:01:11.448 --> 00:01:12.744
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm sorry,
what was the question?

24
00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:14.612
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The question is,
on line four and

25
00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:17.634
a half is there any way to
access the foo from line one?

26
00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:21.165
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The foo from line one, and
then line four, are those the same marble?

27
00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:24.965
Or are they given marbles in
different scopes, right, yeah.

28
00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:28.159
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The foo from line 1
is a red marble in the red bucket,

29
00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.510
the foo from line 4 is a blue
marble in the blue bucket.

30
00:01:36.372 --> 00:01:37.670
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: That's why
we call that shadowing.
