00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.960
&gt;&gt; : Kyle Simpson: Okay and
let's talk about our first exercise.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:09.390
If you will open up with me the read-me,
as well as the EX1.js and the EX1fixed.js.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.560
Actually you don't need to worry
about the solution file yet,

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.670
but at least the read-me and
the fixed file.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.340
And then in your browser if you would open
up with me the fixed HTML version of it.

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.480
So we're gonna demonstrate this
little app that I've built.

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.370
Obviously, it's a very simplified app
to log work against a set of projects.

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.470
We're gonna use this exercise,
this application

9
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.860
to illustrate all of the things
throughout the rest of the workshop.

10
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.990
So we're gonna practice it here
with our types and coercion.

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.010
Then we're gonna come back
to it multiple more times.

12
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.000
A total of eight more times
that we'll be revisiting it.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.300
So the first time here,

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.430
I want you to get more familiar with
the behavior that you're expecting.

15
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.100
So if I say this is some work I did, and

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.010
then I give it some amount of time like
I spent 75 minutes on it and I submit.

17
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.790
It added an entry into my client
features projects of 1:15.

18
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.040
If I did some more work, but
it was only 30 minutes of time,

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.850
you notice that it's gonna actually
sort it in descending order.

20
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.990
So I did a really long project and I spent
200 minutes on it, it keeps to the top.

21
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.370
So it's gonna keep sorting
it in descending order.

22
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.360
If I add items to my
other setup projects like

23
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.670
boring debugging and I said,
I only spent 20 minutes on that.

24
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.630
Then, it's gonna add it to
my other project, okay?

25
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.050
So it's a very straightforward and
simple application, but

26
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.650
it's gonna illustrate a lot of the things
that we wanna talk about in this workshop.

27
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.750
So that's the fixed version of it as it
currently stands, it doesn't fully work.

28
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.150
A lot of the code's
already been written but

29
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.450
it doesn't fully work,
there are several bugs.

30
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.410
And I cover in this Readme in detail,

31
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.550
exactly what you need to know to look for
to fix those bugs, okay?

32
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.620
So I know your instinct
is probably to say,

33
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.190
I'm just gonna skip out
on reading the Readme.

34
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.060
I really strongly recommend.

35
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.150
Click around in that demo yourself in
the fixed version so you see how it works.

36
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.560
Read through the EX1.jscode.

37
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.920
This is the code that's provided.

38
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.970
It's this 175 lines.

39
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.620
And then compare that to
what you read in the Readme,

40
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.720
that will tell you the things
you're looking for to fix.

41
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.620
It mentions, for example, that you should
not need to create any new functions or

42
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.020
reorganize significant chunks of code for
the exercise.

43
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.860
You only need to make
a few spot changes and

44
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.350
a few lines of code,
that's all that necessary, all right?

45
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.390
So I've given you 15 minutes of which more
than half of that is just for you to play

46
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.630
around and get used to this, get used
to this code base and how it works.

47
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.210
The changes shouldn't take
more than a few minutes.

48
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.410
But we list out,
here are the things you need to fix.

49
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.830
Here are some hints to look out for.

50
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.250
Are there strings that should become
numbers or vice versa, that sort of thing.

51
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.250
And then there is a validation
function that you need to fill in,

52
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.680
replacing the TODO comment with
the items listed here, okay?

53
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.360
So that's the subject of the exercise.

54
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.110
We'll give you 10, 15 minutes to work
on that, and then we'll come back and

55
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.960
talk through the solution.
