&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: This is the mental
model that you need to juggle

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.910
to understand what's going on with these
prototype oriented pieces of code.

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.515
You'll notice that that's the diagram
that I was basically drawing,

4
00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:13.060
although I didn't fully finish it out,
but that's basically the drawing.

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.200
That's basically the diagram
that we were getting at,

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.410
if we put in the Bar, it would added Bar
proto type to speak and all of that.

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.960
So, there's your diagram, but the problem
is this diagram is not fully complete.

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.230
We glossed over some
somewhat important details.

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.200
Here's the complete diagram, and I really
didn't wanna draw that on the board.

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.326
That's the complete diagram with all of
the pieces just from that one program

11
00:00:39.326 --> 00:00:41.172
that we were talking about.

12
00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:46.608
To fully explain all of the relationships
you have to diagram all that stuff out.

13
00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:50.212
Now I don't know about you, but I don't
think that's a very effective mental model

14
00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:52.310
for me to figure out what
I'm doing with my code.

15
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.670
There's a lot of complexity there hiding

16
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.710
the simplicity of
the power of that system.
