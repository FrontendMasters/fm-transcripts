00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.291
&gt;&gt; Kyle: I've talked a lot
about the problems of coercion.

2
00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:06.701
And I just wanna take a slight
little detour here for

3
00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:11.619
a moment to say I really, genuinely
wish that we could improve JavaScript

4
00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.451
rather than just talk about
the bad parts of JavaScript.

5
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:21.196
So there's a lot of junk that gets talked
about in the bad parts of JavaScript and

6
00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:24.971
we just assume JavaScript
will always be this poorly

7
00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:29.110
designed collection of mistakes and
bugs and whatever.

8
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.514
And I really wish that JavaScript had
a future where we could eventually start

9
00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:35.670
fixing some of these things.

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.500
And as I said earlier,
I think that there is a way to do that.

11
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.475
So I decided to sit and
talk about if we were gonna fix coercion,

12
00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.530
I wanted to explore that topic.

13
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.102
What would we have to do to fix
coercion and what would that mean?

14
00:00:47.102 --> 00:00:51.462
And this was a blog post, a guest blog
post that I wrote about fixing coercion.

15
00:00:51.462 --> 00:00:54.622
If I could go back and
address it, how might we do that?

16
00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:58.824
Might we have a new mode that you could
opt into similar to strip mode or

17
00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.210
something like that.

18
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.330
Is there some way that we could
begin to address coercion so

19
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.390
that it actually makes sense.

20
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.320
And this is just a list of some of the
things that I would go back and change.

21
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.340
I would for sure change that first one.

22
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.390
Don't make the number coercion
of empty string be 0.

23
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.070
I'd probably change the null one.

24
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.682
I might change the false and the true,

25
00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:26.082
I'd definitely change the string of
location of arrays,to be more correct.

26
00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:29.251
This is just an example of some
of the things I would effect and

27
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:32.920
I talk about them more and more in this
but there is also resource if your

28
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.852
more interested in some of these new
answers that corner cases if you will.

29
00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:40.790
This is a little grid that I created
just it problematically generated but

30
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.393
does the permutation of
all different values and

31
00:01:43.393 --> 00:01:45.760
then the different conversions that we do.

32
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.660
And I've arbitrarily marked which ones I
think make sense versus which ones I think

33
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.070
are crazy and I would change.

34
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.860
You can explore that tool if this
is more interesting to you, if not,

35
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.370
don't worry about it.
