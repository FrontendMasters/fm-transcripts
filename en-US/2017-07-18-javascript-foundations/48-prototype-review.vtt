1
00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.800
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What
is a constructor call?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.880
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: It's a function
call with a new key-

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.148
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Function call with

4
00:00:06.148 --> 00:00:06.941
a new info.

5
00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:11.270
What is this [[Prototype]] chain thing,
what is it?

6
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.261
Where does it come from?

7
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:21.441
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What is it?

8
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:22.581
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Thunder protocol?

9
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:25.341
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's a linkage
from one object to another.

10
00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:26.641
Where does it come from?

11
00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.161
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's created at
the time the object's created, right?

12
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:36.621
When an object is created
it gets linked somewhere.

13
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:44.431
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What would you say is
the most obvious effect that the prototype

14
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:45.922
chain has on an object?

15
00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:54.650
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: You can call
methods of the product type.

16
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.240
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: If we call property or a
method on an object and it doesn't exist,

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.640
what does the prototype chain do?

18
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.661
The delegates of the chain.

19
00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:11.028
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What are three
different ways I showed you to figure

20
00:01:11.028 --> 00:01:13.103
out where an objects
[[Prototype]] links to?

21
00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:17.463
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Under proto?

22
00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:18.163
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Under proto.

23
00:01:20.923 --> 00:01:22.740
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Object
dot gets prototype of.

24
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.060
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Object
dot get prototype of.

25
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.873
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Instructor prototype?

26
00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:28.333
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: [LAUGH] And
dot constructor dot prototype.

27
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.670
Those 3 ways.
