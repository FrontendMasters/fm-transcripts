00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.490
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's double
check our understanding.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.388
How is JavaScript's prototype chain not
like traditional classical inheritance?

3
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
The opposite direction.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.560
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The arrows
go right to left and

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.500
bottom to top instead of
the other way around, right?

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.796
In other words instead
of copying things down,

7
00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:23.727
we have live links up the prototype chain.

8
00:00:26.578 --> 00:00:28.243
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What would you
describe if somebody said hey

9
00:00:28.243 --> 00:00:29.960
what's this whole delegation thing about?

10
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.010
How would you describe what it is?

11
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.738
And how does it describe
the object linking in JavaScript?

12
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.872
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I would say that the
prototype chain is a delegation link from

13
00:00:55.872 --> 00:01:00.960
one object to another that allows those
two objects to share context at call time.

14
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.014
AKA virtual composition.

15
00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:14.528
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We
already talked about this,

16
00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:20.410
one of the benefits of that delegation
design pattern is independent testability.

17
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.620
What do you think some of
the trade-offs of prototype are?

18
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.240
We already mentioned one of them earlier
which was, we lost encapsulation,

19
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.710
everything is in public now.

20
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.859
Can you think of any other down sides
to using prototypes and delegation?

21
00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.560
I mean there's the obvious one, which is
that the code is more complex, all right?

22
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.210
There's no right or wrong answers here,
it's just to probe you into thinking.
