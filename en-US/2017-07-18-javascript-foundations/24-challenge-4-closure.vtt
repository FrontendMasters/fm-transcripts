&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We're
gonna jump into exercise 4.

2
00:00:01.976 --> 00:00:06.560
This one is, it's again the same running
example here where still working with our

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.730
work log but
now we're gonna add a new feature to it.

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.506
The ReadMe fully describes this so I
really strongly encourage you to read it,

5
00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:17.300
don't skip over it, but let me just
describe to you what you're doing.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.150
If you type out a certain
length description

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.050
that is longer than the min length.

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.510
I think it's 20 characters or
whatever it is.

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.950
If you type out a longer
description into the box and

10
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.540
you add it to your little work log,
you'll notice that it dot, dot, dots it.

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.710
It truncates it, right?

12
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.050
What we now wanna do is make it so
that those little truncated, those little

13
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
shortened descriptions, if you click on
the shortened description, it expands it.

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.050
And the way I want you to solve this,
is I want you to solve it with closure.

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.199
I want you to attach a click handler
to that actual description element,

16
00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.280
to that dom element, that remembers
the long form of the description,

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.307
even though you've only put
the shortened form into the dom element.

18
00:00:58.307 --> 00:01:00.184
And when that click handler fires,

19
00:01:00.184 --> 00:01:03.008
it should update the text
to the longer description.

20
00:01:04.743 --> 00:01:07.100
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Those details
are described in the ReadMe.

21
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.160
Don't get worried if that sounds crazy.

22
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.370
That's literally about five lines of code,
so it's not a complex thing at all.

23
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.500
But I just wanna show you this example
of using closure to your advantage.
