00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.520
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I know it was a lot
to throw at you in this workshop.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.574
I promised you that we were gonna
go deep with this material so

3
00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:09.765
hopefully you feel like
you got a lot to chew on.

4
00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:13.744
I wanna leave you with this last thought.

5
00:00:13.744 --> 00:00:15.200
If, for whatever crazy reason,

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.070
you've chosen to make JavaScript
part of your career at this point.

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.957
Doesn't it make to sense
to know your JavaScript?

8
00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:24.366
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Hopefully you feel

9
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:28.190
empowered now to ask deeper questions
about the code that you're doing.

10
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.650
If nothing else that you get from
this course, I hope what you get

11
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.010
is to have an uncommon level of curiosity
to ask why and how does that work?

12
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.659
And more importantly, once I know how it
works, how do I use it to my advantage?

13
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.990
Following the cargo cult that everybody
else has done, it gets you to some local

14
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.910
maximum but it doesn't really get you
to deep understanding of JavaScript.

15
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.450
I didn't have any magical path to that.

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.336
My path to understanding JavaScript was
asking those questions, and asking more

17
00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:03.112
questions, and asking more questions.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's been

18
00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:04.460
an honor to teach this course to you.

19
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.240
I appreciate you all sticking in there and
listening and all the great questions and

20
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.830
interaction.

21
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.080
Thank you for those of you that were
online and stuck around for us.

22
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.382
I just wanna encourage you,

23
00:01:13.382 --> 00:01:17.355
don't let this be the end of your learning
about JavaScript, let it be the beginning.

24
00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:21.078
And if there's anything that I can do
to help you in that path of learning

25
00:01:21.078 --> 00:01:23.200
JavaScript, you have my contact info.

26
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.130
My email's right there in the slides.

27
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.880
Feel free to reach out because
I love helping people.

28
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.570
I get emails all the time from people.

29
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.050
I love to help.

30
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.970
A couple of last little
plugs about myself.

31
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.110
I teach for a living, obviously.

32
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.050
If your company would love to have
me come and teach, if you think that

33
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.740
would be useful, I hope you'll reach
out cuz I love to come and teach.

34
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.060
I fly all over the world all the time,

35
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.080
teaching corporate workshops
like the one we've gone through.

36
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.700
And I'm also working on
an education startup.

37
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.290
A developer education EdTech
startup called DevGo.

38
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.640
It's gonna provide ongoing mentoring in
the workplace for software developers.

39
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.250
If that sounds interesting,
I hope you'll reach out.

40
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.392
Thanks very much for being here.

41
00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:03.000
I appreciate it, and we'll see you again.
