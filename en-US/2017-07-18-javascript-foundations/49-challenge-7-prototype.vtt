&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Here's what
you're doing in excercise seven.

2
00:00:02.537 --> 00:00:05.241
That project thing that we just created,

3
00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:11.260
remember that we made that into a factory
function that makes instances and modules?

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.890
You're gonna convert project
into a prototype oriented code.

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.010
Where the methods on it
are on the prototype chain of

6
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.280
project constructor prototype object.

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.837
And when you call the capital
P project function,

8
00:00:28.837 --> 00:00:31.382
now you're gonna call it with new.

9
00:00:31.382 --> 00:00:35.320
So you're gonna be constructing instances
of this project class basically.
