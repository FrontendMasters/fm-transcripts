&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's
jump into Exercise 5.

2
00:00:02.079 --> 00:00:04.540
Now, I've allocated a much
longer period of time here, but

3
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.500
I wanna explain how this is gonna work.

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.458
If you open up the readme,
there are three parts to this exercise.

5
00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:12.884
And I'm gonna have you do
each part individually, and

6
00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:17.210
then I'm gonna talk through the solution
with it before you start on the next part.

7
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.260
So try not to work ahead, okay?

8
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Just do part one, we'll come back in a few
minutes, after we've worked on part one,

9
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.610
and I'll talk you through that solution.

10
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.560
In part one, the only thing you need to
do is wrap a single module definition

11
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.710
around the entire contents
of our application code.

12
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.720
Just make one module.

13
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.870
Should be pretty straightforward,
it's just a few lines of code.

14
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.100
So we'll take five,
six minutes something like that to do it,

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.470
it's not a lot of work.

16
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.224
But then we're gonna come back, and
do something a bit more sophisticated.

17
00:00:46.224 --> 00:00:48.390
We're gonna start splitting
these up into multiple modules,

18
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.720
that'll be part two and part three.
