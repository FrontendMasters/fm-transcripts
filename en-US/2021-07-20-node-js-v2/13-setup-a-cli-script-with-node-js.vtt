1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.939
So you should feel pretty comfortable
searching for and installing packages,

2
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.647
to try out and use in your development and
I encourage you to do so.

3
00:00:10.647 --> 00:00:13.579
I think especially for
someone new to learn to code,

4
00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.726
there's always this misconception that,
you need to know everything.

5
00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.584
Everything needs to be
created from scratch,

6
00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:21.353
you have to just know
how everything works.

7
00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:24.667
Well, I don't think really anything
works like that, in the world,

8
00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.084
especially in engineering.

9
00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:29.700
We all piggyback off of previous
knowledge, and people that have come

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.272
before us or even that are just
better than us at something specific.

11
00:00:33.272 --> 00:00:36.120
So you don't have to recreate
the wheel every time, and

12
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.878
you should be leveraging the community
by pulling it down and trying it but

13
00:00:39.878 --> 00:00:41.527
also giving back and creating.

14
00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:46.458
When you do find something that's useful
for yourself, you might not understand or

15
00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:49.582
you might not know who else
it could be useful for, and

16
00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:54.178
I really encourage you to try both of
those things, so using PM it's amazing.

17
00:00:54.178 --> 00:00:56.892
Don't try to do everything
from scratch because,

18
00:00:56.892 --> 00:00:59.866
someone probably already solved it,
just install it.

19
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:04.836
The next thing I want to talk about was
CLIs or command line interfaces, so

20
00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:08.374
we've been using CLIs pretty
much this whole time.

21
00:01:08.374 --> 00:01:13.749
NPM is a CLI, node is a CLI,
pretty much any program whose interfaces

22
00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:19.882
on a command prompt like a terminal or
wherever you might be writing this code.

23
00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:22.656
That's a command line interface,
it's just a fancy name for

24
00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:24.650
an app that runs in the terminal.

25
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.923
And you interact with it through
like a command and some texts and

26
00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:30.054
prompts and different things like that.

27
00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:34.450
I would say that there's no visual
representation or visual interaction with

28
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.378
the CLI, but these days people create like
some crazy stuff with CLIs, I've literally

29
00:01:39.378 --> 00:01:43.330
seen someone render a 3D floating
doughnut in a terminal with a CLIs.

30
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.121
So I was I feel like I can't even say
that anymore but for the most part,

31
00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:53.947
there is no UI here for
a CLI it is interacting with the box.

32
00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:57.677
So, we are gonna create a CLI so
if you've never created a CLI before,

33
00:01:57.677 --> 00:02:00.411
you're gonna have fun doing this,
I promise you.

34
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:04.521
I tried to make this one pretty fun and
relatable and usable.

35
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.409
So I'm gonna walk you
through how to do that so

36
00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.203
you can get your own little custom
command inside of the terminal.

37
00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:14.130
And you can see how node makes that easy
compared to a lot of well I wouldn't

38
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.152
say that it's easier than everything else,

39
00:02:17.152 --> 00:02:21.070
pretty much every language is
pretty easy to create a CLI.

40
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.781
I know, Dino makes it super easy to create
a CLI that's one of the biggest features I

41
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:28.808
like about that but
NodeJS is no slouch either, and so

42
00:02:28.808 --> 00:02:31.526
we're gonna figure out
how to do that just now.

43
00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:34.276
So the only difference between a CLI and

44
00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:39.440
a typical NodeJS app is you just need
to add a little bit of more information

45
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.625
to be able to have it consumed in
the correct way when someone installs it.

46
00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:49.350
So what we're going to do is we're gonna
create a CLI that interacts with Reddit.

47
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.368
I want the CLI to be able to go to Reddit,

48
00:02:52.368 --> 00:02:56.865
and open up a random Reddit
post that's on the front page.

49
00:02:56.865 --> 00:03:00.636
It will open up in the browser for
us all we had to do was run the CLI, and

50
00:03:00.636 --> 00:03:03.909
we shouldn't have to worry
about what's going to happen.

51
00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.553
Like if you'd like to Reddit
you'll probably like this if not,

52
00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:09.786
welcome to Reddit, so let's do that.

53
00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:14.784
So the first thing we're gonna
do is let's create a folder in

54
00:03:14.784 --> 00:03:18.900
our little app here, so
we'll make a new folder,

55
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.912
not here but here, and
I'm just gonna call it reddit-cli.

56
00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:27.849
And then because it is a package, we need
this to be a package for many reasons,

57
00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.549
one that we're gonna be
installing other packages.

58
00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.377
And two, we're probably going to
eventually have other people consume this

59
00:03:35.377 --> 00:03:39.550
CLI as a package for their own so
we needed to package for both ways.

60
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.917
So we're going to change
directories into that,

61
00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:48.509
and we're going to run npm init.

62
00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:54.183
And I'm just gonna hit Enter on
everything, get the defaults, good to go.

63
00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:58.906
You can also skip that if you do npm init,
and I think you do --yes, or --y or

64
00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:03.502
something like that, it'll do the same
thing, it'll just skip all of it.

65
00:04:03.502 --> 00:04:08.521
So we got that we got our package JSON
here, I'm gonna add a git ignore,

66
00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:12.048
cuz it's just a habit at
this point node modules.

67
00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:14.309
And there's a bunch of other stuff
you should be adding here, but

68
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:16.292
we'll just do node module
cuz that's an important one.

69
00:04:16.292 --> 00:04:20.549
I don't want that being tracked, slowing
down my computer, and my terminal and

70
00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.508
all that stuff, so
we'll do that and put that in there.

71
00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:28.261
And then what we're going to do
is we need to figure out what

72
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:31.078
dependencies we need to install.

73
00:04:31.078 --> 00:04:35.798
But before we do that, we just want to get
the CLI set up before we even do the logic

74
00:04:35.798 --> 00:04:40.043
of interacting with Reddit, let's
just see if we can get a CLI to work.

75
00:04:40.043 --> 00:04:44.363
So the first thing we have to do is, we
need to just figure out we need to create

76
00:04:44.363 --> 00:04:48.818
a file where the entry point to our CLI
is, what's the file, what's the entry

77
00:04:48.818 --> 00:04:53.164
module, what's going to be executed
when someone runs this command line.

78
00:04:53.164 --> 00:04:56.681
So we gotta tell node NPM where that is,
and

79
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:02.756
then we have to make sure that it's
executed in the correct interpreter.

80
00:05:02.756 --> 00:05:06.724
So in this case the interpreter will
be Node we don't want this file being

81
00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:11.295
executed against Python or Ruby, or Java,
we want it to be executed against Node.

82
00:05:11.295 --> 00:05:15.187
And because we don't know how you're
gonna install this on your machine,

83
00:05:15.187 --> 00:05:19.079
we need to make sure that we're explicit
about that instruction that hey,

84
00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:20.962
this needs to be installed to Node.

85
00:05:20.962 --> 00:05:24.554
So we're gonna use something called a hash
bang that's gonna sit at the top of

86
00:05:24.554 --> 00:05:26.223
the file, it looks just like this.

87
00:05:26.223 --> 00:05:29.955
And this is going to tell your
computer your OS hey this file,

88
00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:33.979
this command needs to be executed
against the Node interpreter,

89
00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.433
and here is the path that
it's usually installed into.

90
00:05:37.433 --> 00:05:40.345
So it's the location to the Node
on someone's computer and

91
00:05:40.345 --> 00:05:42.960
it's gonna try to execute it against that.

92
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.053
So the reason this wouldn't work is
that this person didn't have Node in

93
00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:46.721
this section.

94
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:50.358
If you use NVM, NVM actually puts it here
for you, it's creates like a symlink so

95
00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:53.997
you're good, if you use the native
installer, that's exactly where it goes so

96
00:05:53.997 --> 00:05:55.249
you're definitely good.

97
00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:00.517
So we're gonna do just that so,
we're gonna make a new file here,

98
00:06:00.517 --> 00:06:03.728
I'm just gonna call it reddit-mjs so.

99
00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:15.811
And I'm going to add that hash bang like
this by copy it, Don't forget to hashtag.

100
00:06:15.811 --> 00:06:17.979
Why didn't it copy that hashtag?.

101
00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.153
Or I guess I didn't copy it, there we go,
and if you did it correctly you'll see it

102
00:06:22.153 --> 00:06:25.620
kind of looks like a comment because
it's not really code, right?

103
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.445
Just to show you that this is
actually a comment if I were to

104
00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:34.885
execute this node reddit.njs,
nothing happens.

105
00:06:34.885 --> 00:06:38.379
I don't see anything breaking or anything
like that whereas, I just get rid of that.

106
00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:41.590
And you can see that is obviously
gonna break because that's not valid.

107
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.780
JavaScript thinks it's like a regex or
something so, this gets treated like

108
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.110
a comment node is very much aware of this
is not like a hack, this is a real thing.

109
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.101
So now that we have that,
I'm just gonna do a console log,

110
00:06:53.101 --> 00:06:55.377
so I'm just gonna get
the hello word going.

111
00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:02.854
Hello from Reddit, CLI, so we got that.

112
00:07:02.854 --> 00:07:06.616
So we're almost there, right now we could
execute this in the node runtime and

113
00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:07.134
it works.

114
00:07:07.134 --> 00:07:10.706
But the whole point is that I wanna be
able to come in here and say, Reddit and

115
00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:11.286
hit Enter.

116
00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:17.267
I don't wanna type in Node Reddit that's
not a CLI that's gross, I want a nice CLI.

117
00:07:17.267 --> 00:07:21.424
So, we could do that we can
go to our package.json, and

118
00:07:21.424 --> 00:07:24.614
then we can add a new
field here called bin.

119
00:07:24.614 --> 00:07:29.598
And in fact, we can just look back here,
you'll notice that

120
00:07:29.598 --> 00:07:34.699
the node interpreter is installed
in some folder called bin.

121
00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:38.040
You can think of bin is the folder
where all your CLIs get installed

122
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.164
all your global commands they
get installed in a bin folder.

123
00:07:41.164 --> 00:07:45.324
So we need to register a new
command in the bin folder,

124
00:07:45.324 --> 00:07:51.056
we can instruct NPM to do that for
us when someone installs our Reddit CLI,

125
00:07:51.056 --> 00:07:57.259
by putting something in the packag.json
and that's gonna be on the bin field.

126
00:07:57.259 --> 00:08:01.685
So if we go to bin, we put an object
here now like that but like this, and

127
00:08:01.685 --> 00:08:06.364
then it's just going to be key, which
is the name of the CLI that you want.

128
00:08:06.364 --> 00:08:11.462
In this case, we want to be able
to run a command called reddit, so

129
00:08:11.462 --> 00:08:17.673
we'll put reddit here, and then the path
to the entry file to it so in this case,

130
00:08:17.673 --> 00:08:23.465
the entry file would be reddit.mjs so
like that, we'll put that there.

131
00:08:23.465 --> 00:08:27.444
So in this case, because this is a CLI and

132
00:08:27.444 --> 00:08:33.195
this application is not meant
to be consumed by an import.

133
00:08:33.195 --> 00:08:37.832
I wouldn't expect you to npm install my
CLI, and then import it into your app,

134
00:08:37.832 --> 00:08:42.190
unless I explicitly said hey you can
also use this CLI programmatically,

135
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.258
by importing it.

136
00:08:43.258 --> 00:08:45.623
Most of the time,
that's just extra work for developers, so

137
00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:48.454
they don't always do that, so
it's usually just only consumed by a CLI.

138
00:08:48.454 --> 00:08:51.949
So in that case, this main field
probably just gets ignored, right?

139
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:56.829
This main field is only for when someone's
importing, or requiring your application,

140
00:08:56.829 --> 00:09:01.468
whereas in this case, it's a CLI and we
don't plan on having programmatic access.

141
00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:06.104
So you could think of this as like the
main field when it comes to the CLI and

142
00:09:06.104 --> 00:09:10.743
not this so you can kind of ignore that,
so I just wanted to clear that up.

143
00:09:10.743 --> 00:09:14.877
So now we have the bin here and
then the last thing we need to do is,

144
00:09:14.877 --> 00:09:17.876
we need to install our
own CLI on our computer.

145
00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:20.989
And no we don't have to like
publish it to the NPM registry and

146
00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:24.052
then install it back down,
that would just be ridiculous.

147
00:09:24.052 --> 00:09:28.076
Although sometimes I've had to do that for
conflicts and version reasonings, and

148
00:09:28.076 --> 00:09:29.464
it's really, really bad.

149
00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:33.810
But we can actually just do npm
install -g, as long as we're inside of

150
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.891
the directory of this package, by putting
no arguments at the -g, it's going to

151
00:09:38.891 --> 00:09:43.920
install the package that you're in
globally, is going to stall that globally.

152
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.359
And during this installation process is
when npm is going to see that bin field,

153
00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:51.617
and register that command for
us that points to that file.

154
00:09:51.617 --> 00:09:58.217
So let's give it a try so,
looks like I already did this earlier so

155
00:09:58.217 --> 00:10:03.380
I'm gonna try to,
uninstalled this or let me see.

156
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.109
Let me just delete this actually,

157
00:10:07.109 --> 00:10:12.507
rm -rf that and
I will try to do it again okay cool so

158
00:10:12.507 --> 00:10:18.186
looks like I installed it,
everything looks good.

159
00:10:18.186 --> 00:10:21.611
Cuz I'm using nvm that's gonna
create like a symlink and

160
00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:24.474
all that stuff is good to go so
I was able to do it.

161
00:10:24.474 --> 00:10:28.903
If you're having trouble
with global install locally,

162
00:10:28.903 --> 00:10:32.778
what you can do cuz I've
had this problem before,

163
00:10:32.778 --> 00:10:37.679
is if you delete all of your or
not delete but you uninstall NPM.

164
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:43.597
Uninstall, -g, if you run that and
just uninstall all

165
00:10:43.597 --> 00:10:47.851
your globals then try to reinstall this
one usually clears up a lot of errors.

166
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:51.322
But I have run into some
errors before as you just saw,

167
00:10:51.322 --> 00:10:53.728
with installing globally with NPM.

168
00:10:53.728 --> 00:10:56.450
And then with Yarn,
it doesn't happen sometime, so

169
00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.561
I don't know if you're having problems
with NPM, if you have Yarn try that if not

170
00:11:00.561 --> 00:11:03.536
just uninstall all your global
stuff with NPM uninstall.

171
00:11:03.536 --> 00:11:08.433
If I can spell that right on install
-g and uninstall all this stuff and

172
00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:09.603
then try again.

173
00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:13.619
So once we got that installed,
we should be able to come in here and

174
00:11:13.619 --> 00:11:16.612
say which, if I can spell reddit and
you can see,

175
00:11:16.612 --> 00:11:20.356
I do have reddit here confirmed,
everything's good to go.

176
00:11:20.356 --> 00:11:24.580
So I should just be able to type in reddit
and you can see right there hello from

177
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.092
the reddit cli, and that's it,
that's how you create a CLI.

178
00:11:28.092 --> 00:11:32.099
It's not a good CLI and I mean, it's not
something I would ever use it doesn't even

179
00:11:32.099 --> 00:11:35.834
have a help command, I mean, it just
does the same thing over and over again.

180
00:11:35.834 --> 00:11:39.446
So I wouldn't say you could go
raise funding just yet but,

181
00:11:39.446 --> 00:11:41.153
yeah you got the gist of it.

182
00:11:41.153 --> 00:11:45.871
It's just two small lines of code,
and you add a bin and then you add

183
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:50.769
a hash bang to the top of your entry file,
and then you're good to go.

184
00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:53.508
So he's got to be a little clever
about how you named the CLI,

185
00:11:53.508 --> 00:11:56.787
you never know who else also has that
CLI installed on their machine and,

186
00:11:56.787 --> 00:11:59.129
how that resolves and
different things like that.

187
00:11:59.129 --> 00:12:01.109
So you kinda got to be
clever with the name,

188
00:12:01.109 --> 00:12:03.430
there's really no right
way of getting it right.
