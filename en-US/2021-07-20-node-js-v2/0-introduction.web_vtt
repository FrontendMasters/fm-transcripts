00:00:00.081 --> 00:00:06.729
Welcome to Frontend Masters and Scott Moss
presents Intro to Node.js version two.

2
00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:10.107
So super excited to be
back to teach this course.

3
00:00:10.107 --> 00:00:14.436
Apparently, this is a really popular
course because a lot of people want to

4
00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:18.162
learn how to develop in Node.js
after working on the frontend.

5
00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:21.674
And so when Mark invited me to update it,
I mean, I couldn't resist.

6
00:00:21.674 --> 00:00:23.510
This is one of my most
favorite technologies.

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.394
I use Node.js every single day for
many reasons.

8
00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:31.102
Whether it's trying to buy a RTX
3090s card with a bot doing or

9
00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:34.955
some work at the company that I work at,
and everything in between.

10
00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:38.091
So super excited to talk
about this technology.

11
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:42.363
And I cannot wait to just be part
of everyone's journey as they're

12
00:00:42.363 --> 00:00:45.583
learning how to develop in Node.js and
level up.

13
00:00:45.583 --> 00:00:47.210
So a little bit about myself.

14
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.292
Obviously, my name is Scott Moss.

15
00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:51.883
Right now I'm a senior
engineer at Netflix.

16
00:00:51.883 --> 00:00:53.786
I also do courses like this, so

17
00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:57.089
you might see a lot of my
courses on Frontend Masters.

18
00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.319
Recently I've started a YouTube channel,
where I've been giveing videos and

19
00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:04.232
tips and things like that
about how to break into tech.

20
00:01:04.232 --> 00:01:06.751
So I'm kind of just doing
a lot of stuff right now.

21
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:08.150
And I also just had a new baby.

22
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.855
So I'm a new dad again.

23
00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:11.823
And that feels like a full time job.

24
00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:16.426
So I'm super thankful to
be here to talk about this.

25
00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:20.171
Now, one thing that I want
to just put up front,

26
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:26.166
cuz when I talk to people who want to
learn Node.js, there's always like,

27
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:31.334
well, I know JavaScript, so
therefore, I must know Node.js.

28
00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:32.828
Yes and no.

29
00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:35.828
So, I just want to say this up front,
if you do know JavaScript,

30
00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:37.510
this course is definitely for you.

31
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.099
Because Node.js is a runtime that
uses JavaScript as its language.

32
00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:44.613
So you pretty much know at least
the language to use in Node.js,

33
00:01:44.613 --> 00:01:46.446
which is going to be beneficial.

34
00:01:46.446 --> 00:01:47.475
But there's still just so

35
00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:50.622
much more to know about the environment
that has nothing to do with JavaScript.

36
00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:53.119
So yes and no, JavaScript will be helpful.

37
00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.766
If you don't know JavaScript,
that's totally fine.

38
00:01:55.766 --> 00:02:00.576
If you come from a backend language like
Ruby or Go or any other OS-level language,

39
00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:02.722
this course is also gonna be for you.

40
00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.937
Because you'll understand how these
languages interact with the OS.

41
00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:08.388
You'll just learn how to
do it in JavaScript now and

42
00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:09.761
the ecosystem behind that.

43
00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:15.139
So, whatever side of the fence you're on,
this course is gonna be great for you.

44
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:19.150
And what I want to do is just
send out this link right here.

45
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.227
So you can look at this link for
a website that I have deployed.

46
00:02:22.227 --> 00:02:26.833
Which is pretty much to follow along
with all the notes and copy and

47
00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:31.792
paste code that you can have as you
follow along with me on this course.

48
00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:36.245
You can see the URL right here, so check
out that URL if you want to follow along,

49
00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:38.657
or you can obviously just watch my screen.

50
00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:41.763
And we can go for there, but yeah,
there is gonna be a lot of copy and

51
00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:43.720
paste stuff in there as I'm live coding.

52
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.901
If you just wanna just stay ahead and
and be up to date with that.

53
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:52.078
Obviously, this course is
from Frontend Masters.

54
00:02:52.078 --> 00:02:53.741
I really love the team
here at Frontend Masters.

55
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.681
I've been teaching courses with them for
years now.

56
00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:57.925
And they're basically family.

57
00:02:57.925 --> 00:03:02.324
We all hang out and do stuff together,
so I love working with them.

58
00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:05.844
They kind of just let me teach
it the way that I feel is great.

59
00:03:05.844 --> 00:03:09.385
And it all just works out,
so really appreciate them.

60
00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:12.760
And definitely go check out any other
courses that they have on there.

61
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.096
The catalogue is just growing.

62
00:03:14.096 --> 00:03:17.961
I mean, they literally recorded more this
week that I know that I'm gonna check out

63
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:18.631
personally.

64
00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:22.964
So definitely check them out if you
want to see what else is out there and

65
00:03:22.964 --> 00:03:24.001
stay up to date.

66
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:29.138
Cool, so the format of this
course is basically going to be,

67
00:03:29.138 --> 00:03:33.284
it's kind of going to be
like a sampler platter.

68
00:03:33.284 --> 00:03:36.217
If you don't know what that is,
if you go to a restaurant and

69
00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:39.974
they have all these different dishes and
you don't know which one to get, so

70
00:03:39.974 --> 00:03:43.107
you just order a plate that's got
a small sample of all of them.

71
00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:45.002
That's basically how we're
gonna do this course.

72
00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:48.326
Because there's so
many things you can do in Node.js, and

73
00:03:48.326 --> 00:03:52.330
I wanna show you all the different
things versus focusing on one thing.

74
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.778
Because there's actually a lot of really
good courses on Frontend Masters that

75
00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:57.588
focus on one specific thing in Node.js.

76
00:03:57.588 --> 00:04:02.181
So, after this course, you could kind
of branch off to take one of those as

77
00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:06.572
an elective, dive deep onto APIs or
databases or DevOps or whatever.

78
00:04:06.572 --> 00:04:10.625
But in this course, we're pretty much just
gonna have an intro to all the really

79
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.210
sweet things about Node.js.
