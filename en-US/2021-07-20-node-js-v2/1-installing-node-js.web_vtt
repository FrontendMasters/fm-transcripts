00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.802
What is NodeJS?

2
00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:06.045
Well, NodeJS is JavaScript kind
of like what I said before, but

3
00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:09.991
more specifically it's a run
time built on Chrome's V8.

4
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:14.404
So if you've never heard of Chrome's V8
it's the engine that sits inside of Chrome

5
00:00:14.404 --> 00:00:17.701
that actually compiles your
JavaScript down to machine code so

6
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:21.678
it can be processed, because JavaScript
actually has to be interpreted and

7
00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:23.005
execute it on a machine.

8
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:24.543
V8 is the engine that does that.

9
00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:29.060
So some really smart person decided
to strip V8 out of Chrome and

10
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.660
stick it on a machine.

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.995
And that allows you to run node, and
that's basically what we have here.

12
00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:37.240
And everything is built on top of that.

13
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.451
So just like on the front end, JavaScript
and node is also gonna be based off

14
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:47.664
an event loop, which if you don't
really know what that means, we'll get

15
00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:52.990
into that a little more but just know
is that JavaScript is single threaded.

16
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.861
As in it's only going to
be able to process work and

17
00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:01.022
amount of work in like one
little isolated instance.

18
00:01:01.022 --> 00:01:03.595
And then everything else kind
of runs in the background.

19
00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:08.425
This allows node to be able to process
things much faster than a lot of

20
00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:13.357
other OSS level languages,
as long as those tasks are not CPU bound.

21
00:01:13.357 --> 00:01:16.442
So if you're not doing things
like arithmetic or AI, or

22
00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:19.464
machine learning node js is
probably a perfect tool for

23
00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:23.076
you because it can handle things and
put them in the background and

24
00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:27.109
continue to stay open to handle
incoming requests and things like that.

25
00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:32.104
That's why it's a very popular tool
because it kind of allows you to scale

26
00:01:32.104 --> 00:01:37.842
a lot faster for smaller tasks like APIs
which are 90% of backend apps these days.

27
00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:39.480
So that was a whole lot.

28
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.209
Well we're gonna cover
a lot of that stuff.

29
00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.434
And like I said, here's a some of
the use cases that I think are really,

30
00:01:45.434 --> 00:01:46.920
really good for node js.

31
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.443
Some of the things you see in the wild,
some of the things that I've used

32
00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:54.556
personally, myself, so things like API's
and servers, which we are gonna cover

33
00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:57.461
today, we're gonna be going over that and
how to do that.

34
00:01:57.461 --> 00:01:58.659
Databases.

35
00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.038
Yes, they literally are some
databases built in JavaScript.

36
00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:04.688
And it kind of blows my mind how people
get away with this because I've like

37
00:02:04.688 --> 00:02:05.558
looked at source code.

38
00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.839
I'm like, first,
I don't even know how to make a database.

39
00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:08.522
And second of all,

40
00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:10.838
the fact that you did it in
JavaScript is just even more amazing.

41
00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:14.928
But yeah,
I've seen databases built in node COIs.

42
00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:18.325
So a command line interface if you've ever
used Git, you've ever used anything in

43
00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:21.298
your terminal, your command prompt
that was a command line interface.

44
00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:23.557
We're also gonna be covering
some of that as well.

45
00:02:23.557 --> 00:02:25.733
So you'll be making your own CLIs.

46
00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:28.277
Build tools and automations.

47
00:02:28.277 --> 00:02:31.956
If you're a front end developer, you're
probably familiar with something called

48
00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:34.348
Bubble, maybe even TypeScript,
WebPack, RollUp.

49
00:02:34.348 --> 00:02:37.847
All those tools are built and
executed in the node runtime.

50
00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:42.252
So if you've never used node as a front
end engineer, but you've used those tools,

51
00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:46.532
well, you have been using node this whole
time because those tools execute in node

52
00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:49.469
before your app actually gets
deployed to the browser.

53
00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.009
That's what node is doing.

54
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.789
Basic scripting.

55
00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.110
You want some automation setup to
do some shortcut get commands.

56
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.896
You wanna have some basic commands
in your terminal that don't exist,

57
00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:00.790
you can do that.

58
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.867
Simple automations that open up a browser
and buys a pair of sneakers for you,

59
00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:05.819
stuff like that.

60
00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.740
And like I said, GPU shopping for bots
because no one can buy a GPU right now.

61
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.443
You could pretty much do all
this stuff in node and more and

62
00:03:14.443 --> 00:03:16.459
we'll be covering a lot of it.

63
00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.142
So I'm super excited.

64
00:03:18.142 --> 00:03:22.609
So let's jump right in and
get started with node.js.

65
00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.511
So the first thing obviously is
we need to install node.js and

66
00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:28.319
there are a few ways to do it.

67
00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.250
And it also depends on
the machine that you're on.

68
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.170
So for the windows folks out there if
you're not running WSL or WSL two,

69
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.238
which is like a Linux environment embedded
inside of windows, if you don't have that,

70
00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:47.568
then I do recommend going to the official
node js installer on the nodejs.org

71
00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:53.649
website where it'll detect your operating
system and it'll allow you to download it.

72
00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.139
Mine says Mac because I'm on a Mac.

73
00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.478
If yours was a Windows,
it would probably say Windows.

74
00:03:58.478 --> 00:04:00.828
So I recommend installing it that way.

75
00:04:00.828 --> 00:04:06.656
But if you aren't on Windows, or
anyone else who's not windows basically,

76
00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:11.778
I do recommend using something
called NVM or node version manager.

77
00:04:11.778 --> 00:04:15.866
If you are not on Windows I do
recommend using something called NVM,

78
00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:18.318
which stands for node version manager.

79
00:04:18.318 --> 00:04:19.719
The definition is in the name.

80
00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.948
It's literally a tool that manages
different versions of node on your

81
00:04:22.948 --> 00:04:23.448
machine.

82
00:04:23.448 --> 00:04:27.288
And the reason why I recommend this is for
a few reasons.

83
00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:31.135
One, it's very convenient to be able
to switch to different versions of node

84
00:04:31.135 --> 00:04:35.458
because different versions of nodes have
different features, different language,

85
00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.018
support and things like that.

86
00:04:37.018 --> 00:04:40.264
So you can apply your app to
different targets great for testing,

87
00:04:40.264 --> 00:04:44.348
great for determining, you know what
version you need on a deployment platform.

88
00:04:44.348 --> 00:04:45.563
It's just very useful.

89
00:04:45.563 --> 00:04:49.594
And then also on a Mac, at least in my
experience and working with others,

90
00:04:49.594 --> 00:04:53.040
when you install from the official source,
sometimes you have

91
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.089
permission errors with the folders
where node actually gets installed.

92
00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:00.730
You just kind of have to like sudo
everything and it just gets really crappy.

93
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.916
So to avoid that node version manager just
doesn't work around it doesn't install

94
00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:07.989
inside of that folder that
causes those permission errors.

95
00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:11.008
So yes, I highly recommend NVM and
if you go to there,

96
00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:15.373
you click on that link that I have and
you go to their repo,if you scroll down,

97
00:05:15.373 --> 00:05:19.672
you'll see a nice copy and paste double
curl thing here that you can paste and

98
00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:22.795
run and it'll pretty much get
you set up and good to go.

99
00:05:22.795 --> 00:05:27.365
So if you don't have node installed yet,
I do recommend installing it.

100
00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:32.394
If you do have node installed,
we are going to use a specific version.

101
00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:36.437
The one that we're going to use
is going to be the latest LTS or

102
00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:39.542
was it long term support or
lifetime support.

103
00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:40.046
It's one of those.

104
00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:44.767
It's the one that they plan on supporting
on the long run for now, although it's not

105
00:05:44.767 --> 00:05:49.042
the absolute latest .16 would be
the latest but it's not the latest LTS.

106
00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:53.603
So we're gonna use the latest LTS,
which right now is 14.7.0.

107
00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:57.907
So if you don't have that version, I would
at least recommend downloading version 14

108
00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:01.745
at the minimal to make sure you have some
of the things that we're gonna cover in

109
00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:05.758
this course because we are gonna be using
some of the bleeding edge things because I

110
00:06:05.758 --> 00:06:08.085
want this course to be
somewhat future proof and

111
00:06:08.085 --> 00:06:11.025
I don't want to teach outdated things and
older versions.

112
00:06:11.025 --> 00:06:15.698
So yes, I highly recommend downloading at
least version 14 here to be able to keep

113
00:06:15.698 --> 00:06:17.249
up with what we're doing.

114
00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:20.424
If you do download version 16
you should be more than fine.

115
00:06:20.424 --> 00:06:21.789
There's nothing wrong with that.

116
00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.129
I just want to support the long
term support version of node js.

117
00:06:28.541 --> 00:06:33.252
Okay, and once you have NVM installed,
you could actually just run this command

118
00:06:33.252 --> 00:06:38.254
right here NVM install --LTS and this is
gonna install that latest version for you.

119
00:06:38.254 --> 00:06:40.419
So you don't have to figure
out which one it is.

120
00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.297
If you don't put that LTS flag,
I think it will install version 16

121
00:06:44.297 --> 00:06:47.439
which again is also fine as
long as it's at least 14.

122
00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:51.731
So whatever you wanna do, install that
latest version so we can get going and

123
00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:52.880
making some stuff.
