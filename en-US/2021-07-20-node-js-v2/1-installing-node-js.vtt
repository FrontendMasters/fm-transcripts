00:00:00.043 --> 00:00:01.865
What is Node js?

2
00:00:01.865 --> 00:00:06.105
Well, Node js is JavaScript kinda
like what I said before, but

3
00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:10.107
more specifically it's
a runtime built on Chrome's V8.

4
00:00:10.107 --> 00:00:14.401
If you've never heard of Chrome's V8, it's
the engine that sits inside of Chrome that

5
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.220
actually compiles your
JavaScript down to machine code.

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.623
So it can be processed because JavaScript
actually has to be interpreted and

7
00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:23.015
executed on a machine.

8
00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:24.909
V8 is the engine that does that.

9
00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.478
So some really smart person decided
to strip V8 [LAUGH] out of Chrome and

10
00:00:29.478 --> 00:00:30.957
stick it on a machine.

11
00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:35.490
And that allows you to run Node and
that's basically what we have here and

12
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.734
everything is built on top of that.

13
00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:42.900
So just like on the front end, JavaScript
and Node is also gonna be based off

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.066
an event loop, which if you don't
really know what that means, we'll get

15
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:53.159
into it a little more but just know is
that JavaScript is single threaded.

16
00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.391
As in, it's only going to
be able to process work and

17
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:01.349
amount of work in one
little isolated instance.

18
00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:03.910
And then everything else
kinda runs in the background.

19
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.668
This allows Node to be able to process
things much faster than a lot of

20
00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:13.432
other OS level languages,
as long as those tasks are not CPU bound.

21
00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:17.538
So if you're not doing things like
arithmetic or AI or machine learning,

22
00:01:17.538 --> 00:01:21.580
Node js is probably a perfect tool for
you because it can handle things and

23
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.218
put them in the background and continue to
stay open to handle incoming requests and

24
00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:27.299
things like that.

25
00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.718
So that's why it's a very popular tool
because it kinda allows you to scale

26
00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:34.313
a lot faster for smaller tasks like API's,

27
00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:38.060
which are like 90% of back
end apps these days anyway.

28
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.569
So that was a whole lot.

29
00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.250
Well, we're gonna cover
a lot of that stuff.

30
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.492
And like I said, here's the some of
the use cases that I think are really,

31
00:01:45.492 --> 00:01:46.938
really good for Node js.

32
00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:50.598
Some of the things you see in the wild,
some of the things that I've used

33
00:01:50.598 --> 00:01:54.868
personally, myself, so things like API's
and servers, which we are gonna cover

34
00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:57.869
today, we're gonna be going over that and
how to do that.

35
00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.160
Databases, yes, there're literally
are some databases built in JavaScript.

36
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.951
And it kinda blows my mind how people
get away with this cuz I've looked

37
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:08.000
at source code I'm like, first,
I don't even know how to make a database.

38
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.640
And second of all,

39
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.804
the fact that you did it in
JavaScript is just even more amazing.

40
00:02:10.804 --> 00:02:14.370
But yeah,
I've seen databases built in Node.

41
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.931
CLI, so a command line interface,
if you've ever used Git, you've ever used

42
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:21.720
anything in your terminal, your command
prompt that was a command line interface.

43
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.720
We're also gonna be covering
some of that as well.

44
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.570
So you'll be making your own CLIs
build tools and automations.

45
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.217
If you're a front end developer, you're
probably familiar with something called

46
00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:34.540
Babel, maybe even TypeScript,
Webpack, roll up.

47
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.820
All those tools are built and
executed in the Node runtime.

48
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.197
So If you've never used Node as a front
end engineer, but you've used those tools,

49
00:02:42.197 --> 00:02:44.738
well, you have been using
Node this whole time.

50
00:02:44.738 --> 00:02:49.188
Because those tools execute in Node
before your app actually gets deployed to

51
00:02:49.188 --> 00:02:51.661
the browser, that's what Node is doing.

52
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:56.217
Basic scripting, you want some automation
set up to do some shortcut get commands,

53
00:02:56.217 --> 00:03:00.069
you wanna have some basic commands
in your terminal that don't exist,

54
00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.981
you can do that.

55
00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:03.595
Simple automations that
open up a browser and

56
00:03:03.595 --> 00:03:06.500
buys a pair of sneakers for
you, stuff like that.

57
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.084
And like I said,
[LAUGH] GPU shopping for bots,

58
00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:11.214
because no one can buy a GPU right now.

59
00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:14.608
You could pretty much do all this
stuff in Node, and more, and

60
00:03:14.608 --> 00:03:16.320
we'll be covering a lot of it.

61
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.300
So I'm super excited.

62
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.790
So let's jump right in, and
get started with Node js.

63
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.690
So the first thing obviously is
we need to install Node js and

64
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.570
there are a few ways to do it.

65
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.610
And it also depends on
the machine that you're on.

66
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.139
So for the windows folks out there
if you're not running WSO or

67
00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:41.031
WSO2, which is a Linux environment
embedded inside of windows.

68
00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:45.469
If you don't have that,
then I do recommend going to the official

69
00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.859
Node.js installer on
the nodejs.org website,

70
00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.284
where it will detect your operating system
and it will allow you to download it.

71
00:03:54.284 --> 00:03:56.105
Mine says mac because I'm on a mac,

72
00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:58.671
if yours is windows it
will probably say windows.

73
00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:01.490
So I recommend installing it that way.

74
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:07.234
But if you if you aren't on Windows, or
anyone else who's not windows basically,

75
00:04:07.234 --> 00:04:11.924
I do recommend using something
called nvm or Node Version Manager.

76
00:04:11.924 --> 00:04:15.682
And the definition is in the name, it's
literally a tool that manages different

77
00:04:15.682 --> 00:04:17.294
versions of Node on your machine.

78
00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:20.494
And the reason why I recommend this is for
a few reasons,

79
00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:24.935
one it's very convenient to be able to
switch to different versions of Node.

80
00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:28.099
Because different versions of
Node have different features,

81
00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.671
different language support and
things like that.

82
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:34.851
So you can apply your app to different
targets, it's great for testing, great for

83
00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:38.990
determining what version you need on a
deployment platform which is very useful.

84
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.837
And then also on a Mac,
at least in my experience and

85
00:04:41.837 --> 00:04:46.477
working with others when you install from
the official source, sometimes you have

86
00:04:46.477 --> 00:04:50.915
permission errors with the folders
where Node actually gets installed.

87
00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:54.485
You just kinda have to Sudo everything and
it just gets really crappy.

88
00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:57.777
So to avoid that Node Version Manager
just doesn't work around and

89
00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:01.675
doesn't install inside of that folder
that causes those permission errors.

90
00:05:01.675 --> 00:05:06.406
So yes, I highly recommend nvm,
you click on that link that I have and

91
00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:07.885
you go to their repo.

92
00:05:07.885 --> 00:05:12.435
If you scroll down you'll see a nice copy
and pastable curl thing here that you

93
00:05:12.435 --> 00:05:16.440
can paste and run and it'll pretty
much get you set up and good to go.

94
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.950
So if you don't have node installed yet,
I do recommend installing it.

95
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.979
If you do have Node installed,
we are gonna use a specific version.

96
00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.983
And the one that we're gonna use
is going to be the latest LTS or

97
00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:32.989
was it long term support or
Lifetime support?

98
00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:37.125
It's one of those, it's the one that they
plan on supporting on the long run for

99
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:41.016
now, although it's not the absolute
latest, 16 would be the latest but

100
00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:42.900
it's not the latest LTS.

101
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.169
So we're gonna use the latest LTS,
which right now is 14.7.0.

102
00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.924
So if you don't have that version,

103
00:05:48.924 --> 00:05:52.963
I would at least recommend downloading
version 14 at the minimal to make sure you

104
00:05:52.963 --> 00:05:56.083
have some of the things that
we're gonna cover in this course.

105
00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:59.886
Because we are gonna be using some of the
bleeding edge things because I want this

106
00:05:59.886 --> 00:06:03.690
course to be somewhat future proof and
I don't want to teach outdated things and

107
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.562
older versions.

108
00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:09.425
So yes, I highly recommend downloading at
least version 14 here to be able to keep

109
00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:11.030
up with what we're doing.

110
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.758
If you do download version 16
you should be more than fine,

111
00:06:13.758 --> 00:06:15.370
there's nothing wrong with that.

112
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.648
I just want to support the long
term support version of Node js.

113
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.489
Okay, and once you have nvm installed,

114
00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:29.633
you could actually just run this command
right here in nvm install -- LTS.

115
00:06:29.633 --> 00:06:32.094
And it's just gonna install
that latest version for you, so

116
00:06:32.094 --> 00:06:33.935
you don't have to figure
out which one it is.

117
00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:37.809
If you don't put that LTS flag,
I think it will install version 16,

118
00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:40.840
which again is also fine as
long as it's at least 14.

119
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.751
So whatever you wanna do, install that
latest version, so we can get going, and

120
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:45.739
making some stuff.
