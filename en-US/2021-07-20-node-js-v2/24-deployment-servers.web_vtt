00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.598
Now, when it comes to servers,
servers are API's,

2
00:00:02.598 --> 00:00:06.492
they need to be hosted on a machine just
like they're hosted on your local host.

3
00:00:06.492 --> 00:00:08.380
They have to be hosted somewhere else.

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.964
So there's a lot of places
you can deploy servers.

5
00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:15.060
We could talk for
days about which one's better?

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.873
Which one's this or that?

7
00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:18.650
But at the end of the day,
they're pretty much all the same.

8
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.881
They have different trade offs.

9
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:23.170
We're going to use Heroku today
because it's just the easiest to do.

10
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.589
It has the simplest UI.

11
00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.936
And you don't need to be a DevOps person
to understand half the options in

12
00:00:29.936 --> 00:00:30.872
the drop down.

13
00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:33.473
So we're gonna do Heroku.

14
00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:38.509
If you've never heard of Heroku,
the best way I can

15
00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:43.791
describe Heroku,
it is a really nice UI on top of AWS.

16
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:49.772
They use AWS as their infrastructure as do
a lot of other competitors to Heroku do.

17
00:00:49.772 --> 00:00:52.912
It's just a better UI on top
of it with better features.

18
00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:55.483
Well, I wouldn't say better features,
simpler features.

19
00:00:55.483 --> 00:00:59.610
It's an abstraction around
the complicatedness of AWS.

20
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.040
So we're going to use Heroku for that.

21
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.328
And to get started,
we just have to do a few things and

22
00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:05.732
already done all these things.

23
00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.995
So I'm just gonna walk you through some
of the things that I didn't do and

24
00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:10.021
then we'll get to it.

25
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:14.951
The first thing is we need to get our
application ready to be deployed.

26
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:20.181
It has to be deployable
on another machine.

27
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:23.575
Right now is a lot of stuff that's hard
coded that only works on our machines.

28
00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:27.844
Specifically like the port,
we hardcode the port to be like 8000.

29
00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:28.712
That's not gonna work.

30
00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:31.027
When we deploy this, we have no
idea what the port is going to be.

31
00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:35.090
It's going to be assigned dynamically
to whatever Heroku wants it to be.

32
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.349
So we have to find a way to make that
a dynamic variable because we don't have

33
00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:39.141
access to it yet.

34
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:40.681
So those are some of
the things we need to do.

35
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:44.167
We also need to teach Heroku about
what type of app this is and

36
00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:45.504
how to start this app.

37
00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:47.380
You're not always going to
have the same start script.

38
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.620
Sometimes you need to do this or do that.

39
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.832
So you have to specify
Heroku how to start it.

40
00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:54.900
And then we actually have to create
a Heroku app and push it up there.

41
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.781
So we're going to do just those things.

42
00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:59.718
The first thing, like I said,
is create a Heroku account.

43
00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:01.400
If you don't have one, it's free,

44
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.640
it doesn't cost any money
to create an account.

45
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.631
They're pretty generous
with their free tiers.

46
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:07.917
So highly recommend
creating a Heroku account.

47
00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:11.110
It's great for just prototyping
servers that you want to deploy.

48
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.650
Unless you're really serious and
you're making money.

49
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.327
Yeah, you can just get away with
a free account for a long time.

50
00:02:18.327 --> 00:02:21.050
And then you want to
install their Heroku CLI.

51
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.804
This is just one way to create an app and
deploy it.

52
00:02:23.804 --> 00:02:25.011
So we're going to follow this path.

53
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.711
But you can also just go through
their GUI, do a couple clicks and

54
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:28.820
get it deployed that way.

55
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.501
But for the sake of node.JS,
we're gonna stay in the terminal.

56
00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:33.890
We're gonna try to do it this way.

57
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.861
So, install their CLI.

58
00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:42.661
And once you have that, you just need to
tell Heroku what type of app this is.

59
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:46.699
So, the first thing we can do is we can
add a start script to our scripts inside

60
00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:47.401
of our APIs.

61
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:53.354
So, I'm gonna go to our API here,
which is going to be the server.

62
00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:57.991
We're going to go to
the package.JSON that I don't have.

63
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:59.155
So I'm going to make that.

64
00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:03.982
And I'm going to say NPM.

65
00:03:03.982 --> 00:03:07.287
And it's like that.

66
00:03:10.951 --> 00:03:12.405
In the server, there's one more.

67
00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:14.200
Forgot that last enter.

68
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.070
So we're going to go here,
we're going to go to scripts.

69
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.571
I'm going to do start.

70
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:23.064
And I'm just going to point
this to the entry to my server.

71
00:03:23.064 --> 00:03:25.080
Which in this case is going to be,

72
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.321
I want to run the express
server which is server.ms.

73
00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:30.080
So I'm going to point to that.

74
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.306
So I'll say node, Server.mjs.

75
00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:37.152
So we're gonna point to that.

76
00:03:37.152 --> 00:03:39.120
So that's how you start our server.

77
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.700
So now Heroku knows how to do that.

78
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.140
And the last thing is I need to tell
Heroku what version of JS that I'm using.

79
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.230
And this is important because we are using
a relatively new version of JavaScript

80
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.503
that supports modules.

81
00:03:49.503 --> 00:03:54.859
So I need to say, engines and
then you can say node.

82
00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.862
And then you could put the version.

83
00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:04.121
Mine is 14.17 or what version am I using?

84
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:05.492
Let me see node.

85
00:04:07.217 --> 00:04:11.858
Version 14.170, you could probably
also do literally the number 14.

86
00:04:11.858 --> 00:04:14.450
It will probably work as well.

87
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.851
It'll just find the latest 14.

88
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:19.285
So you wanna do that just to specify we're
on the same version because the last thing

89
00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:21.260
you want is like well,
it worked on my machine.

90
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.388
Well yeah your machine's using version 14,
but on Heroku we're using version 8.

91
00:04:25.388 --> 00:04:27.611
So yeah,
I'm sure it did work on your machine.

92
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:28.611
It's a common thing.

93
00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:32.540
This is why something like Docker was
created to help with these problems.

94
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.920
But we're not using Docker,
we're just going straight to Heroku.

95
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.756
Okay, so now that we got that,

96
00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:41.054
we do need to clean up our code
a little bit to not be so hard coded.

97
00:04:41.054 --> 00:04:43.501
So the one specifically is this port.

98
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:46.450
Instead we need to make this dynamic,
it needs to be a variable.

99
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.551
So we're gonna say
process.env.port capital P-O-R-T.

100
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:52.754
Now, I know this to be true.

101
00:04:52.754 --> 00:04:56.284
Not only because I've deployed to Heroku
so many times, but because this is

102
00:04:56.284 --> 00:05:00.383
obviously the default environment variable
that every single hosting provider uses.

103
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:01.730
They use port, all caps.

104
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.384
So we're gonna do that and
I'm not gonna put local.

105
00:05:04.384 --> 00:05:06.931
I mean, we can leave this here,
this log is fine.

106
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:10.332
It's just it's not gonna be accurate
because we're not on localhost 8000

107
00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:12.322
anymore, but
you should change that as well.

108
00:05:12.322 --> 00:05:15.797
And I'm sure Heroku does inject like
a host name variable on the environment

109
00:05:15.797 --> 00:05:19.120
that you could put here if you wanted to,
but it's not hurting anybody.

110
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.235
So we'll just leave it.

111
00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:25.580
And the next thing we
want to do is we have

112
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.601
the Heroku CLI,
we should say Heroku login.

113
00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:36.248
Okay, press any key, okay.

114
00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:41.718
And they want me to go update
my Terms of Service on Heroku.

115
00:05:41.718 --> 00:05:44.453
So I guess I'll do that.

116
00:05:45.793 --> 00:05:47.743
Got this password manager here.

117
00:05:47.743 --> 00:05:50.230
I don't think I have MDM here
otherwise I would have used it.

118
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.645
So [SOUND] I want to use this accounts.

119
00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:56.198
Okay, let's do it.

120
00:05:56.198 --> 00:05:57.066
We're already here.

121
00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:09.176
Okay, looks like I updated my stuff so
we're good here.

122
00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:13.957
The next thing I want to do is
let me just date this along.

123
00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:18.267
I want to make sure I have
the proper GitIgnore.

124
00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:21.440
I don't want to check
in these node modules.

125
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.100
So I'll do a dot.gitignore and at the very
least, I'll check out these node modules.

126
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.380
But you should also check in pretty
much everything I have here.

127
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.370
Very helpful, according to Heroku.

128
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.451
So but yeah, you don't want any
error logs, you don't want DS

129
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:40.953
store which is like this floating
ghost file that floats around on Mac.

130
00:06:40.953 --> 00:06:41.830
It's kind of annoying.

131
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.112
It's really big.

132
00:06:43.112 --> 00:06:49.354
Any .ENV files which are probably
full of secrets, so ignore all those.

133
00:06:49.354 --> 00:06:51.230
And we did the login.

134
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.270
Now we have to do a create.

135
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.811
This is going to create an app on Heroku.

136
00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:56.560
Like I said,
you could also do this in a GUI.

137
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.140
It's totally fine if you wanna do that.

138
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.181
I was gonna do it here
from the command line.

139
00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:02.255
I'm gonna say Heroku.create.

140
00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:06.808
It's gonna make us a nice app,
get that nice Heroku spinner,

141
00:07:06.808 --> 00:07:09.535
that nice zen name hidden Savannah.

142
00:07:09.535 --> 00:07:11.750
That's our URL there.

143
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:20.469
And I need to add this Git URL
to my Git repositories.

144
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:23.380
So this is not a Git repository yet.

145
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.090
So I'm gonna say Git init like this.

146
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:34.480
And then I'm gonna say Git remote and
we'll call this Heroku.

147
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.820
And we'll paste that to there.

148
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:43.625
So now that I got that,
I can say Git Push Heroku name.

149
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:48.920
Did I not?

150
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.872
Wait, did this already do this?

151
00:07:49.872 --> 00:07:50.643
Let's check this out.

152
00:07:50.643 --> 00:07:52.847
So, wait hold on.

153
00:07:57.092 --> 00:07:59.367
Lots of additional rows first.

154
00:07:59.367 --> 00:08:00.580
Is it not called name?

155
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.299
Hold on, let's see Git remote dash v.

156
00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:05.810
Yeah, it's right there.

157
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:11.211
Git push Heroku,
maybe they still call it master?

158
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:14.431
No.

159
00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:15.872
Good push for Heroku.

160
00:08:15.872 --> 00:08:20.760
Let's say git push Heroku.

161
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.172
I want to branch.

162
00:08:22.172 --> 00:08:25.701
I'm pretty sure it's master or main.

163
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:30.101
Or yeah, git push for Heroku.

164
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:31.146
Guess it doesn't like that I did that.

165
00:08:31.146 --> 00:08:33.119
Let's just create a new hat.

166
00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:37.207
And I think it'll set up for
us now that I have a git okay?

167
00:08:37.207 --> 00:08:39.900
Now let's look at git remote-v.

168
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:47.100
Or gits remotes Heroku remove,

169
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:53.241
git remote remove Heroku.

170
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.013
Now let's create another one.

171
00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:59.931
And hopefully it added it for us.

172
00:08:59.931 --> 00:09:03.817
There we go.
So it looks like it added it so

173
00:09:03.817 --> 00:09:07.926
then I'll say git push, Heroku.

174
00:09:07.926 --> 00:09:08.910
Maybe that was it.

175
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.837
So let's try to commit some code.

176
00:09:10.837 --> 00:09:15.185
[SOUND] I thought it
will still try to push.

177
00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:18.810
[SOUND] Whoa,

178
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.425
what happened?

179
00:09:23.425 --> 00:09:26.031
Whoa, sorry.

180
00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:27.941
I don't know.

181
00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:32.707
What happened to my terminal, okay?

182
00:09:32.707 --> 00:09:35.460
Open it back up.

183
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.072
What?

184
00:09:41.162 --> 00:09:43.114
Okay, that was weird.

185
00:09:43.114 --> 00:09:44.640
That was really weird.

186
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.640
What was that?

187
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.149
Okay, let's try to push this now.

188
00:09:48.149 --> 00:09:54.730
Now git push Heroku okay,
let's go to the GUI there.

189
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.996
This is why you have a GUI.

190
00:09:58.996 --> 00:10:01.577
So, let's go to Heroku.

191
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:16.520
And I have a bunch of apps in
here somewhere, let's see.

192
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.700
Personnel looks like it was
all of these right here.

193
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.713
So I'll take this hidden Savannah one.

194
00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:29.756
And I'm going to deploy and

195
00:10:29.756 --> 00:10:35.192
I can deploy from this
thing says let me try this.

196
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.467
Okay, looks like we're good here.

197
00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:42.860
I might actually be able to do this.

198
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.660
Let's give that a try.

199
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.692
Hey, look at that.

200
00:10:47.692 --> 00:10:49.661
I love that copy and paste documentation.

201
00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:52.460
So as you can see, it's building.

202
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.784
This is the output of the build.

203
00:10:53.784 --> 00:10:57.733
It's transferring to Heroku and is trying
to detect what type of app I have and

204
00:10:57.733 --> 00:10:58.601
all that stuff.

205
00:10:58.601 --> 00:11:01.050
So it says, Node JS app detected.

206
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.364
Here's some environment variables
that we put in your app.

207
00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:10.353
Installing these binaries
[SOUND] a bunch of stuff here.

208
00:11:10.353 --> 00:11:13.441
Build's succeeded,
that's what I wanted to see.

209
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:15.781
Default types is the web process.

210
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:18.827
So in Heroku,
a web process means this is an API.

211
00:11:18.827 --> 00:11:23.024
Because you can also have background,
job processes, which are background jobs.

212
00:11:23.024 --> 00:11:27.011
And that web process defaults to
web if you have a start script.

213
00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:28.450
And it says it deployed.

214
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.830
So let's see what happens.

215
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.762
So if we try to go to this URL, let me
just confirm what we had in our API.

216
00:11:34.762 --> 00:11:38.862
Which was a slash to do post and Git.

217
00:11:38.862 --> 00:11:41.137
So I'm gonna try this from the terminal.

218
00:11:41.137 --> 00:11:44.566
I'm gonna say HTTP.

219
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.920
That thing slash to do still get requests.

220
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.100
And look, it returns an empty array.

221
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.216
That works.
So let's try to do a post and

222
00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:57.803
put a something in there.

223
00:11:57.803 --> 00:12:00.651
I think it was a text field
we wanted on the object.

224
00:12:00.651 --> 00:12:04.910
So we'll say a clean kitty litter.

225
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.406
My cat poops a lot, so
we got to clean the kitty litter.

226
00:12:08.406 --> 00:12:10.443
And we're gonna do that,
looks like that worked.

227
00:12:10.443 --> 00:12:13.681
We can get it back with this and
boom, there we go.

228
00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:16.486
Our app is deployed, we can confirm.

229
00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:20.942
If we go back to Heroku and
I could look at activity or not activity,

230
00:12:20.942 --> 00:12:23.738
I'm sorry, I should be Vlogs here we go.

231
00:12:23.738 --> 00:12:25.060
And we should see some logs here.

232
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.760
You can see that I did a get
request to slash to do.

233
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.510
I did another post and another Git here.

234
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.810
So everything seems cool.

235
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.678
And then here's our outdated localhost
8000 log, which isn't relevant anymore.

236
00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:37.970
But like I said, it's not hurting anybody.

237
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.590
And that's how you would deploy a server.

238
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:44.170
So Heroku allows you to add databases and
different things like that.

239
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.221
And they have documentation on that
much better than I could describe.

240
00:12:47.221 --> 00:12:49.770
So if that's what you're looking for,
you can go much further with that.
