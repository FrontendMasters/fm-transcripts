[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.415 --> 00:00:06.469
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Some other
stuff that I wanna point out,

3
00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:08.410
some links that I wanna direct you to.

4
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.509
And these are all, by the way,
you should all have your PDFs and

5
00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:11.623
you can follow along in the PDFs.

6
00:00:11.623 --> 00:00:14.936
By the way, especially even those
of you that are here in person,

7
00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:18.622
but if you're following along in
the PDFs I have slide numbers up there.

8
00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:21.430
And from time to time I'll make sure to,
if I can remember,

9
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.050
I'll make sure to say what slide we're on,
so we're on slide 7 right now.

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.890
I give you that on purpose so that you
can take notes against the slides.

11
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.936
Cuz there'll be times where I show
a slide today where I talk for

12
00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:33.703
45 minutes on one slide.

13
00:00:33.703 --> 00:00:35.173
And there's no possible way for

14
00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:38.233
me to put all of that information
that I'm saying into slide form.

15
00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:41.967
So I highly recommend, as boring and lame
as that sounds, I recommend you take notes

16
00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:45.550
against the slides, the slide numbers,
so that you can go back to them.

17
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.430
But the other thing I'll say is there'll
be links that are provided in the PDF.

18
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.128
There will also be a bunch of places
in the code where I show code snippets.

19
00:00:53.128 --> 00:00:55.830
And the code snippets that I show in
these slides, they're just images,

20
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.165
they're screenshots of colors and
text highlighted code.

21
00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:02.045
Code, which sucks cuz nobody wants to
retype all that code and actually,

22
00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:03.405
shockingly, actually have to write code.

23
00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:06.905
We don't wanna write code, so there'll be
links in the bottom left hand corner of

24
00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:11.075
many of the slides, I'll point it out to
you when we get to it in a few minutes.

25
00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:14.135
But there'll be a little link in the
bottom left hand corner that says code me

26
00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:17.715
and if you click on that link it will pop
you up to a web browser with that code

27
00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:19.245
there so that you can copy and paste it.

28
00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.536
It'll run that code so
you can check it out and try it yourself.

29
00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:26.942
So that's a benefit of following along
with the PDFs, both now and later.

30
00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:31.080
First link I wanna point you to, just by
show of hands those of you here in person,

31
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.316
how many of you have heard of
Mozilla Development Network, MDN?

32
00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:36.310
Ok, about three-fourths of you?

33
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.000
Good.

34
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.880
How many of you know that
MDN is an open public wiki?

35
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.280
Yeah, like one of you, one or
two of you raised your hands.

36
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.542
That's why I point this out, because I
think that's actually a hugely important

37
00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:49.410
fact that's kind of, it goes unknown.

38
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.180
We just sorta think, well, there's some
team of people at Mozilla that goes and

39
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.770
maintains all of that documentation.

40
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.720
The truth is it's owned by us,
the web platform community.

41
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.099
So, there have been a number of times that
I've been reading some documentation for

42
00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.554
some API feature, and
either said something incorrectly or it's

43
00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:10.709
worded weird, or it's not good example or
there should be added information.

44
00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.467
You just sign in, create a free account,
sign in and edit it,

45
00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:17.202
just would like you would with any wiki,
like you would for Wikipedia or whatever.

46
00:02:17.202 --> 00:02:20.947
And we can all contribute to
the betterment to this documentation, so

47
00:02:20.947 --> 00:02:22.990
I highly recommend you do that.

48
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.440
I know a number of people on the MDN team,

49
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.720
they would be thrilled if we could get
more people participating in that.

50
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.000
So as a little piece of homework today,

51
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.140
if there's something that I teach you
about JavaScript, I mention some API or

52
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.020
something like that, as a little piece for
homework, I recommend that you go and

53
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.530
do a search for that topic on MDN,
and see what it has to say.

54
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.640
If I talk about some API, the substring,
string function or something,

55
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.330
go look that up on MDN,
get familiar with that.

56
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.260
Idiomatic.js looks like
a JavaScript project,

57
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.030
it's actually a write up of
idiomatic styles that are commonly

58
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.280
accepted across the web platform,
across the JavaScript community.

59
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.830
I don't agree with everything that's
written there, but you never do.

60
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.520
So, I think it's just
a great place to start,

61
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.100
probably 80% of it I think is great.

62
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.550
If you do not have a style guide for
your own projects or for

63
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.940
your team if you work at a company.

64
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.310
If you don't have one of those, this is
a really, really solid place to start.

65
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.840
Sit down at a brown bag lunch
with your fellow employees.

66
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.710
Read through it over lunch and say, hey,
we agree with that, I like that, but

67
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.560
I don't agree with this.

68
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560
So just come up with that.

69
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.480
It's a great place to start.

70
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.970
So check out idiomatic.js
