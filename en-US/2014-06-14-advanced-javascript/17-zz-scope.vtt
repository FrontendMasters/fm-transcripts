2
00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:06.330
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's review
where we've been so far.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.308
What types of scoping rule or
rules does JavaScript have?

4
00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:14.468
What's the scope rule called?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Lexical

5
00:00:14.468 --> 00:00:15.757
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Lexical scoping,

6
00:00:15.757 --> 00:00:16.969
that's the one.

7
00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:20.069
What are the exceptions,
how do we cheat lexical scopin

8
00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:20.709
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Eval.

9
00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:21.325
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Eval and

10
00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:27.229
the width key rule, those are two ways
to cheat with the exceptions to lexical.

11
00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:31.448
What are the different ways
you can create a new scope?

12
00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.149
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Functions.

13
00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.162
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Functions create a new

14
00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:34.789
scope, what else?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A catch.

15
00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:35.414
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Catch blocks

16
00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:38.630
create a new scope, what else?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Curly braces.

17
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.489
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The curly braces with

18
00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.348
the let keyword will create a new scope,
okay?

19
00:00:45.348 --> 00:00:47.830
What's the difference between
undeclared and undefined?

20
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.799
Remember I mentioned that earlier?

21
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:49.999
Can anybody remember?

22
00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.739
What's the difference between
undeclared and undefined?

23
00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.239
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Undefined has a value.

24
00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.359
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Undefined is a value.

25
00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.339
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is a value.

26
00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.859
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What is undeclared?

27
00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.121
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It hasn't been registered to

28
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.780
any scope yet.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's never been declared.

29
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050
So another way of explaining undefined.

30
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.930
Some people say undefined means it's
a variable that doesn't yet have a value.

31
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.560
That's not really correct cuz
a variable can have a value and

32
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.750
then not have a value.

33
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.060
So really the proper way of thinking
about it if you want to sort of,

34
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.870
conceptually is undefined means
doesn't currently have a value.

35
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.899
Or currently, the value is sort of an
empty placeholder or something like that.

36
00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:25.979
It's another way of thinking about it.

37
00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.755
But, it means explicitly,
if you have an undefined value,

38
00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:32.879
there there definitely
was a declared variable.

39
00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:34.575
Cuz if there's not a declared variable,

40
00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.620
what you're gonna get back
is a reference error.

41
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.160
That make sense?

42
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.360
So keep declared and defined,
even though they sound like synonyms,

43
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.010
keep them separate.
