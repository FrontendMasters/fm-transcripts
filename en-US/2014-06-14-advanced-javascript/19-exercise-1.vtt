2
00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:08.167
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So I will orient you to
the exercise, what you wanna do, and again

3
00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:13.320
as a reminder both for you here in person
as well as for you listening in online.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.350
If you only have one copy of that
exercises folder, before you start

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.330
modifying things, I recommend just making
a separate copy of your exercises folder.

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.650
That way at some later date,

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.900
you can go back to a pristine copy of
these exercises and try your hand at them.

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.800
But, we're gonna open up,
I got to go to day one.

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.290
We're going to go the exercises folder.

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.010
Go to Ex 1.

11
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.438
You can open up the readme file and
the JS file.

12
00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:38.599
All right.

13
00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:42.450
[COUGH]
The readme is gonna explain what

14
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.610
you need to do, but also you're gonna
come over here to your browser and

15
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.370
open up ex1.html which is
gonna load your ex1.js.

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.250
And you're immediately gonna get an error
on the very first line of your program.

17
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.530
That's on purpose.

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.460
Okay?

19
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.350
So, what this says is,
it wants you to fix the code so

20
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.700
that our program will correctly print
out the full alphabet A through Z.

21
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.190
That's what the program's designed to do.

22
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.100
Right now, our error's out.

23
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.570
We've got to fix those errors.

24
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.810
This is asking you to take what
you've learned about scoping,

25
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.970
about hoisting, about IIFEs and
all that other stuff.

26
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.800
Put all that stuff together into
a way to solve the problem.

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.620
Now, I have constrained your
ability to solve this problem.

28
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.103
You are not allowed to
just put console.log a,

29
00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:30.250
console.log b in a program to solve it.

30
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.170
So I've constrained your solution.

31
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.090
You cannot have any
global variables at all.

32
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.820
If you look at the file,
you'll see everything's global.

33
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.830
So first thing you're gonna have to solve
is that you have to stop having any global

34
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.760
variables at all.

35
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.330
The second thing is that
you cannot delete or

36
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.150
combine any of the existing
function declarations.

37
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.800
You have to leave the function
declarations or whatever as they are.

38
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.600
You can't delete or combine them.

39
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.904
You cannot create any new functions,
except there's an exception,

40
00:01:55.904 --> 00:01:57.193
that you can create IIFEs.

41
00:01:57.193 --> 00:01:59.469
And that's a big hint, cuz you're
gonna need to create some IIFEs.

42
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.120
And you cannot rearrange the order
of any of the declarations.

43
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.690
You have to use what you know about the
way hoisting works to solve your problems.

44
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.440
The things that you can
explicitly do is you can declare

45
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.320
extra variable as long
as their not global.

46
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.740
You can modify a function declaration and

47
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.530
turn it from a declaration
into an expression.

48
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.660
or from an expression into a declaration,
and you'll probably need to do that.

49
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.300
You can add or remove various statements
or expressions, like the returns, or

50
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.970
IIFEs, or parameters.

51
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.000
And the explicit answer here
is you wanna search for

52
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.990
making the fewest changes possible.

53
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.360
This does not call for you to change
every line of this entire program.

54
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.590
To solve the problem.

55
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.360
So go through it one at a time.

56
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.760
Try to constrain yourself to these rules,
and

57
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.960
see if you can get it to print out,
a through z.

58
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.810
I will walk you through an answer to
this in a few minutes right before we

59
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.520
take our lunch break.
