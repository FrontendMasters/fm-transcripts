[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:06.270
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I also do
a lot of conference speaking.

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.920
I won't belabor this too much, cuz I'm
already talking too long about myself.

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.810
I don't wanna waste your time
droning on about myself.

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.260
But I do wanna highlight
just one quick thing.

6
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.910
These are some of the conference talks
I've done over the last several years,

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.040
and there's all kinds of video and
slides up online if you're interested.

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.050
But I'll highlight just one of them,
it's the browser versions are dead talk.

9
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.520
And if this is at all interesting to you,
this topic when I explain it,

10
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.190
there's a video of that talk up
at browserversionsaredead.com.

11
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.070
And I highly recommend that you go,
take a brown bag lunch,

12
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.810
take 45 minutes at lunch at work some day,
sit down with your team, and

13
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.330
listen to that, and you can totally decide
that you disagree with everything I say,

14
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.530
but, I hope that it will
spark some good conversation.

15
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.560
The premise of this talk
is that our industry for

16
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.780
the last, more than a decade now,
has been guided by a set of lies and

17
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.170
misconceptions that have been forced upon
us by actors from outside of our industry.

18
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.840
People like marketing departments,
sales departments, CEOs, clients,

19
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.150
people that don't understand
how the platform works,

20
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.250
have been trying to dictate to
us how the platform should work.

21
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.470
And as professionals I think it's time for
us to start pushing back and

22
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.300
asking some difficult questions and

23
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.350
saying maybe that's not how we
should be letting our platform run.

24
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.640
The first of those questions,
the first of those lies and

25
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.690
misconceptions is that
the browser version even matters.

26
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.980
You hear all the time the people say, I'd
love to do that but I still have to quote

27
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.420
unquote support IE 6 or fill in the blank
with whatever particular browser version

28
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.630
or browser vendor that is your hated one
at the moment, and I think that actually

29
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.150
leads to this misconception that the
browser version matters, cuz in reality

30
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.620
it's just an arbitrary marketing label
attached to an arbitrary set of features.

31
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.470
What we should really care about
are the features themselves.

32
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.160
We should be talking about what features
we require, what features we support,

33
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.310
and any other software discipline besides
the web platform has embraced that for

34
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.540
four decades or more.

35
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.116
If you look at Linux programs that were
written 30 years ago, they were feature

36
00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:58.641
testing every single thing that they used,
but that's sort of a relatively new

37
00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:01.980
mindset that we've adopted in the web and
I think we need to do more of that.

38
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.173
You shouldn't rely on a production feature
unless you're feature testing for it.

39
00:02:05.173 --> 00:02:09.889
You shouldn't assume that because you're
in IE7, you have some feature or not.

40
00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.449
The other bigger, important lie that I
think we need to attack is this idea that

41
00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:18.594
a site or an application should be
designed and built in such a way that it

42
00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:23.650
works, feels, and behaves exactly the same
in all browsers and all versions.

43
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.330
Because, again, this outside of our
platform that's a ludicrous concept for

44
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.410
you to suggest I wrote a piece
of software today, and

45
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.570
I expect it to work the same on
a Linux server from thirty years ago.

46
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.050
That's not the way that the rest of
the software discipline treats software.

47
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.030
It's an evolving thing.

48
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.070
Different features get turned on and
turned off and things.

49
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.630
So I think we should build our sites and

50
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.230
applications to be responsive to
the environments that they run in.

51
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.215
If you have a file upload feature
built into your social network and

52
00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.470
you're running in a browser
that doesn't have file upload,

53
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.640
instead of just blocking users and
saying sorry you can not come into my

54
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.030
social network cuz you're on a crappy
browser, which is what a lot of people do,

55
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.830
I think we should just simply
hide the file upload feature.

56
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.800
And it doesn't take a lot of extra effort
to think about layering your applications

57
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.650
to turn things on and off,
provide fall-backs, and so forth.

58
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.940
So these are questions that
I'm trying to push back on and

59
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.990
give you questions to ask and
push back on those key players.

60
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.490
Now, the reality is that 99% of the time,
when you push back and you

61
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.520
tell your client, we don't wanna build it
that way, here's a better way to build it.

62
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.470
They're gonna tell you, that's all fine
and good, but you still have to do it.

63
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.490
So, you're gonna lose that
battle 99% of the time.

64
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.720
But I like to tell people that you will
lose 100% of the battles that you never

65
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.780
fight and
only 99% of the ones that you do fight.

66
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.600
So, these are questions that we need to,
as professionals, we own this industry and

67
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.720
we own our platform.

68
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.890
It's all of us and we need to ask those
challenging questions and push back so

69
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.720
that we can, like I said, and
stop living 10 years in the past and

70
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.300
start living 10 years in the future.

71
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.700
So, lastly about myself,
as many of you probably know,

72
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.350
I have been writing a series of books
called You Don't Know JavaScript.

73
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.560
The first title's Scope and Closures is
out in actual printed physical book form.

74
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.380
You can find that from O'Reilly,
Amazon all those other places.

75
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.240
I'm writing them for free,
totally in the open, so

76
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.550
if you go to youdontknowjs.com,
redirects to the Github repo,

77
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.560
they're completely open
released under the CC3 license.

78
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.270
So I'm writing them in the open and then
O'Reilly has been gracious enough to agree

79
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.730
to professionally edit and publish those.

80
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.230
The second title is already
complete in terms of draft.

81
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.220
The editing is in its final stages, and

82
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.040
that should go to publish within
the next few weeks, hopefully.

83
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.050
There's a plan for
five titles in the series.

84
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.309
And it's very aggressive, but

85
00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:38.210
we're hoping that all five titles
should be out before the fall.

86
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.670
So, there's quite a bit of writing
that I'm doing on this series.

87
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.130
Most of the stuff that I'm gonna teach
you today comes from these books.

88
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.020
The whole first section that we talked
about, about Scope and hoisting and all.

89
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.240
If you've read the book or
if you know anything about the book.

90
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.070
Basically, the books are sort of the
written form of the trainings that I give.

91
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.110
So it's all sort of typed together and
these books are a good place to go and

92
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.860
read further beyond what we teach today.

93
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.610
That's it for stuff about myself.

94
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.310
That was long and really boring.

95
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.760
Let's get to more interesting stuff.

96
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.430
Let me make a couple of
other recommendations.

97
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.680
I don't get any benefit whatsoever,
no kickbacks, but

98
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.540
I do recommend both of these
books as fantastic books.

99
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.780
The first one is High Performance
Java Script by Nicholas Zakas.

100
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.270
Now this one's a few years old, but

101
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.920
Nicholas is writing as I understand,
an updated version of this book.

102
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.660
So, hopefully there will be a second
edition of that coming out,

103
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.550
it's a fantastic book to read.

104
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.590
The other one,
Stoyan Stefanov's JavaScript Patterns.

105
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.010
Really, really rigid, formal look,
design patterns applied to JavaScript.

106
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.340
I don't agree with everything
that's written in these books, but

107
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.670
they're fantastic books to read.

108
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.100
So I highly recommend you check them out,
really smart guys that wrote those.
