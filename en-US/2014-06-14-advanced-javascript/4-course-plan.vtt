00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.637
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So I'm gonna give you,
this not the official title, but

3
00:00:07.637 --> 00:00:10.750
this is kind of the unofficial title for
todays.

4
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.550
This is a two day workshop,
this is the unofficial title cuz,

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.170
this is what I give when I give
this one day talk is a standalone.

6
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.280
I call it the What you need to know Parts,

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.900
Advanced JavaScript,
The What you need to know Parts.

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.400
And I need to explain to you
what my practice is gonna be.

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.183
You should already get a flavor from that
just from our discussion of looking at

10
00:00:27.183 --> 00:00:27.760
the spec.

11
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.060
But I want you to understand what
you should be expecting from today.

12
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.800
So first of all I call
it Advanced JavaScript.

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.249
Does that mean that I expected you to be
an advanced JavaScripter before walking

14
00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:39.060
in here, before joining online?

15
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.820
No, that's not what I expect.

16
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.490
What I do kind of recommend is that
you're taking this course with

17
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.390
at least maybe one to possibly two
years of experience with JavaScript.

18
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.830
And that's not a requirement,

19
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.120
it's just a recommendation that you at
least be familiar with the language.

20
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.706
So we could call that sort of
somewhere between beginner and

21
00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:56.718
intermediate in terms of your experience,
kind of your base experience.

22
00:00:56.718 --> 00:00:59.150
I'm not gonna teach you how for
loops work,

23
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.660
I'm going to expect that you
understand stuff like that.

24
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.480
But I am gonna take things which
you might consider to be basics.

25
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.350
Things like lexical scope, which you
just sort of, maybe you never heard it

26
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.858
called that, but you just sort of
understand kind of intuitively.

27
00:01:12.858 --> 00:01:17.080
We're gonna take that stuff and
break it down into extremely deep detail.

28
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.890
I'm gonna give you compiler
terminology here in a few minutes.

29
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.020
And that may feel a little uncomfortable,
because some of us aren't quite like me.

30
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.828
I write compilers for fun,
but not everybody does that.

31
00:01:26.828 --> 00:01:31.610
So understanding that kind of deep
terminology and concepts can be difficult.

32
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.180
And so when I say Advanced JavaScript,
it really is kind of the advanced basics.

33
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.770
We're gonna take the basic things
that I think are requirements for

34
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.480
you to understand before you can
be an Advanced JavaScripter.

35
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.004
There's a whole bunch of stuff
that you could spend ten or

36
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:49.590
more years in this industry writing
JavaScript and never actually understand.

37
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.280
And there's a lot of people
that will attest to that.

38
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.460
I've written JavaScript for a decade and
I didn't understand how closures work.

39
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.430
It's just a fact,
because JavaScript's so approachable,

40
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.120
it's so easy to get up and going.

41
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.704
And you can spend your entire career
never being forced to actually learn it.

42
00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:06.840
I'm gonna force you today to actually
learn how that stuff really works.

43
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.630
So some people would define
Advanced JavaScript as broad as possible.

44
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.460
Let's look at every possible acronym and
framework and hot pattern of the day and

45
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.330
let's talk about all
these possible things.

46
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.500
And there's lots of great courses,
Marc's got lots of great courses and

47
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.900
there's lots of other
great content out there.

48
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.210
Infinite numbers of blogs and

49
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.780
books that talk about that sort of stuff,
that's not what today is.

50
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.030
Today is gonna be a very narrow scope
of what we're gonna discuss, but

51
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.440
we're gonna go extremely deep with it.

52
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.770
We're gonna dig our teeth deep into this
stuff, so that's what I mean by advanced.

53
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.300
And when I say the what
you need to know parts,

54
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.010
obviously I'm making a play off
of Crockford's The Good Parts.

55
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.934
But when I say the what
you need to know parts,

56
00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:45.660
I'm going to explain to you when
we talked about the this keyword.

57
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.290
Or when we talk about the definition
of what closure means.

58
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.600
I'm going to explain to
you in what I hope is

59
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.850
more understandable terms than
just quoting to you the spec.

60
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.580
I'm not just gonna show you a bunch
of screenshots of what the spec says.

61
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.570
Although I think it's important to
be aware of what the spec says, so

62
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.810
that you're not saying things incorrectly.

63
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.370
My focus here is to give you
practical takeaways on things, so

64
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.290
this is the what you need to know
definitions for these things,

65
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.200
rather than necessarily the academic ones.

66
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.423
There will be people that will
disagree with me and say no, no, no,

67
00:03:15.423 --> 00:03:16.092
that's not a type.

68
00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:18.840
Or no, no, no,
that's not really accurate about closures.

69
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.690
And my answer to that is to just shrug and
say, well.

70
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.697
I'm not interested in
being academically formal,

71
00:03:24.697 --> 00:03:27.074
I'm more interested in giving
us practical understanding.

72
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.790
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay.

73
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.510
So, without any further ado,
this is gonna be our first discussion.

74
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.080
Point we're gonna spend a good portion
of the morning talking about scope and

75
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.120
closures.

76
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.770
So we're gonna start by
talking about Nested Scope,

77
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.870
we're gonna move into
a discussion of Hoisting.

78
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.820
May or
may not of ever heard of what hoisting is.

79
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.330
Now I'm gonna do something
kind of interesting,

80
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.710
cuz if you don't understand
anything about these mechanisms.

81
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.210
It should seem strange to you
that third item on the list,

82
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.070
when I talk about the this keyword.

83
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.820
Sort of injected right in the middle of
the discussion about lexical closures.

84
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.630
Maybe that seems weird, maybe it doesn't.

85
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.980
If it doesn't seem weird to you,

86
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.480
I hope it does seem weird to
you by the time we get there.

87
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.490
Because the point is actually that these
are completely opposite mechanisms.

88
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.510
So the reason I stick it right there in
the middle is to make it really obvious,

89
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.180
the contrast, the difference between them.

90
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.190
So this is an unusual approach.

91
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.310
In the books, I didn't deal with a this
keyword inside of the scope in closures

92
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.370
cuz my editor was like,
no, that's too weird.

93
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.640
But when I'm doing training,
I can do whatever I want and

94
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.500
I think it's better to talk about
it there, so that we can contrast.

95
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.460
So that's intentional
that it's kind of weird,

96
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.680
but then we'll jump right back
into a discussion of closure.

97
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.860
And I should also say,
there will be a fair amount of lecturing.

98
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.124
I'm gonna do a bunch of talking and
thing's like that, but

99
00:04:39.124 --> 00:04:42.080
there is also as you know,
there are five exercises.

100
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.670
Each one of those is designed to be
anywhere from seven or eight minutes up to

101
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.530
fifteen minutes of free time that
you're working on something.

102
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.430
Or I give you the exercise,
I give you some time to work on it.

103
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.734
I shut up for a little bit and then I
come back and kind of give you a guided

104
00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:59.050
solution tour if you will,
kind of how I would approach things.

105
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.980
There's no right answer
to any of this stuff, but

106
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.890
I do provide in each one of those
exercises, a fixed version of the files

107
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.170
that gives you my example of
how I would have done it.

108
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.560
So at a later time you can come back and
say, well how did Kyle do it?

109
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.070
But that doesn't necessarily mean
that's the only way to do it, so

110
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.900
there will be exercises for you to do.

111
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.086
Now if we contrast that to what
we're gonna deal with tomorrow,

112
00:05:18.086 --> 00:05:20.859
there's comparatively a lot
less lecture tomorrow and

113
00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:23.400
a whole bunch of just
hacking at the code terminal.

114
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.050
So there's very few slides, and

115
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.660
we spend most of our time just
kind of live coding, tomorrow.

116
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.900
So if you're really looking for that
code and you feel like I'm lecturing and

117
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.460
I'm too much boring,
just hold off until tomorrow.

118
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.820
If you like the lecture stuff,
there'll be plenty of that today.

119
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.410
The goal for today is to give you
a really, really solid foundation

120
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.220
of understanding about the core
mechanisms that JavaScript relies upon.

121
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.480
So that when we talk about scope,

122
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.810
I mean when we talk about
something inside of node.js.

123
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.100
And I just assume that you
understand what lexical scope means

124
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.340
when I talk about a module the scope.

125
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.350
I'm gonna assume that you understand what
that means and I can't assume that today.

126
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.670
Even if I looked at some of the responses
from the pre-event surveys.

127
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.550
Some people felt really
confident with the stuff and

128
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.630
other people are coming in with
not quite so much confidence.

129
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.080
So the goal is that everybody walks
away from today with that confidence.

130
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.840
So that when we talk about node tomorrow,
there aren't

131
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.860
questions about those core mechanisms,
we can really focus on the thing.

132
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.750
It's kind of one of those hidden
secrets about the node world.

133
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.390
A lot of people tend to think that if
you talk about a scale of one to five,

134
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.120
like my understanding of
JavaScript is a two out of five.

135
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.610
Then my understanding of node is
two out of five and in reality,

136
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.210
they're actually kind of skewed.

137
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.640
You can have an understanding three,
in JavaScript, out of five and

138
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.140
you can still be at a one
level understanding in node.

139
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.190
Because node requires you to understand
a whole bunch more of the language

140
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.960
than you've ever been forced
to understand really before.

141
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.270
Or you get yourself into trouble.

142
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.440
So they're kind of skewed and that's why
we set this up as a two day workshop.

143
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.630
So that we can make sure that
we fully understand JavaScript

144
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.520
before we talk about node.
