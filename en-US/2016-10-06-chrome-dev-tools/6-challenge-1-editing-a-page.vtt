[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.063 --> 00:00:05.890
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So now,
the first challenge.

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.510
And this, everybody'll be able to do,
even if you're on the NodeCast site.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.118
So if you go to the Editing tab,

5
00:00:11.118 --> 00:00:16.406
I just figured we could take maybe 10 or
15 minutes, something like that.

6
00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:18.340
And there's a bunch of
challenges on here like,

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.830
can you change the body's background?

8
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.462
Can you move this into the list?

9
00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:25.760
Can you find where the scroll listener is?

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.010
All these different things that
we've kinda covered so far.

11
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.340
And all of these, yeah,

12
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.550
I think every single one of these has
multiple ways you could go about it.

13
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.055
So maybe getting a little comfortable
opening the style sheet and sources, and

14
00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:41.065
you can use it like a text editor.

15
00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:43.162
Or open it in the Elements tab and
just make,

16
00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:45.485
snipe those little changes in that way.

17
00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:47.085
So for those of you that have it locally,

18
00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:52.555
it would be cool if you wanted to set up
a workspace, so it all persisted to disk.

19
00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:56.390
For those that are accessing it through
NodeCast, you won't be able to.

20
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.220
Anyway, feel free to ask me any questions.

21
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.638
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, before we do break,
there's a handful of questions online,

22
00:01:01.638 --> 00:01:03.480
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool.

23
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.564
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And I'm gonna attempt to
phrase them in a way that communicates

24
00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:07.735
what they're asking.

25
00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:09.420
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Awesome.

26
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The first one is from
Stephen, and the question he's asking is,

27
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.360
how do you remap back to the server
instead the file system?

28
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.165
So getting, maybe the question is
around removing the workspace, or.

29
00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:28.540
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, so the workspace
will always be identifiable as this orange

30
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.443
folder, although that's
probably subject to change.

31
00:01:31.443 --> 00:01:34.802
But you'll always be able see
your workspace, and you can just,

32
00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:36.550
let me get in here.

33
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.030
You can just right-click it and
then remove folder from workspace.

34
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.758
That'll ask you if you wanna do it,

35
00:01:41.758 --> 00:01:44.980
and now you're back to local
host just like before.

36
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.930
And that's good to do,
because workspaces aren't host dependent.

37
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.481
So basically it's like a text editor,

38
00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:54.510
where you can open up
a bunch of different folders.

39
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.430
So if you don't remove them,
you'll just end up with

40
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.400
all of these projects kind of
scrolling down your list over here.

41
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.920
So yeah, you should probably remove
them when you're not working on that

42
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.540
project anymore.

43
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.784
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
then the next question is from Ian H.

44
00:02:10.784 --> 00:02:12.843
And I think he's trying to get at,

45
00:02:12.843 --> 00:02:16.565
does it save automatically, or
do you have to do the Cmd+S?

46
00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:18.910
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cmd+S
when you're in sources.

47
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.566
So if you've got a file open, so
if we change, I guess it's not.

48
00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:25.960
You would still be able to see it,
even though I got rid of the workspace.

49
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.080
So we change this, and we can immediately
see that an asterisk came here,

50
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.020
which means it's unsaved.

51
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.560
So you'd have to hit Cmd+S to save it.

52
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.840
No anything but
adding when you're in Elements.

53
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.060
So any change you make, like if I
just changed this to pink, it's done.

54
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.180
It's saved to my workspace.

55
00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:47.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then from Kedar,

56
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.030
is the whole point of this to not
even have to open an external editor?

57
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.850
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: It's not, I mean,
that's opinion, I like that idea a lot.

58
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.770
So okay, so I guess a step back
on why this matters is, so for

59
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.390
anybody that's worked with a language
like C++ or Java or something like that,

60
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.650
one of the really cool
things is that your editor,

61
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.570
your IDE,
also is the full debug environment.

62
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.390
You've got this whole world set
up to help you write software.

63
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.640
We have a big disconnect in JavaScript,

64
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.750
because we're working in a very
different way, we're authoring files.

65
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.841
But then that file just gets like thrown
over the wall to the client, right?

66
00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:27.257
And they interpret it based
on what browser they have.

67
00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:32.030
So that makes our job a lot harder, right,
because we can't control that environment.

68
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.212
So the cool thing about this is,

69
00:03:34.212 --> 00:03:38.470
it kinda brings you more in line with,
you can do your step through debugging.

70
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.900
You can look and see if there's errors,
you can edit and author files.

71
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.550
You can do all that in the same area,
which I think is great.

72
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.540
That being said, I'm not anti-editor.

73
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.212
You should definitely still,
you know what I mean,

74
00:03:51.212 --> 00:03:52.510
do whatever you're comfortable with.

75
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.849
But I do like this, because it's like
one less application to toggle between,

76
00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:57.579
basically.

77
00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.910
You can do all your
authoring right in line.

78
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.170
So I feel like that's kind of opinionated,
I like that idea.

79
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.420
I like the idea of just using
Chrome DevTools tools as your editor, but.

80
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, one last question,
clarification from Ian.

81
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.280
He's wondering, if we're viewing
a website, can you just save the in-memory

82
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.850
data to disk,
dump the memory contents directly to disk?

83
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.080
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, so
there's a couple of different things.

84
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.600
So as far as memory contents go,

85
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.530
when we cover the memory leaks area,
so let me back up.

86
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.140
We're gonna generate a bunch of
different stuff in Chrome DevTools.

87
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.410
We're gonna do memory profiles,
CPU profiles,

88
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.750
all these different things,
network profiles.

89
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.040
And all three of those do generate a file,
and

90
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.180
all three of those files
can be saved to disk.

91
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.430
So for a network,
it's a H-A-R file, HAR file.

92
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.080
And so yeah, all of those can be generated
and saved, which is really cool,

93
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.670
because I've had this happen before.

94
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.440
I've been complaining about
something with DevTools.

95
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.932
I'm like, it's whatever, and then somebody
that works on DevTools is like hey,

96
00:05:01.932 --> 00:05:03.946
will you send me an HAR of your network?

97
00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:05.730
And you save it and email it.

98
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.905
And so the same with memory and
CPU, so yeah,

99
00:05:07.905 --> 00:05:10.670
all three of those we'll be
able to save and send around.
