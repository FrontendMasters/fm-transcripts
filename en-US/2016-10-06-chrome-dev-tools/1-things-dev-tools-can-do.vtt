[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:06.999
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And then, to kind of get
into the meat of what we're gonna talk

3
00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:09.860
about today, just an overview
of things dev tools can do.

4
00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:15.290
So we're gonna talk about using dev
tools to create and edit files.

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.362
We're gonna be talking about using
dev tools to actually author code, so

6
00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:19.660
not just tweak existing code.

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.630
Able to persist changes to disk,

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.960
so you use dev tools as your
primary editor essentially.

9
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.860
Step through debugging, so no more
console logging in every single function.

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.260
A really handy way to just actually
step through applications.

11
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.080
Do a full page audit for performance.

12
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.840
Emulate different devices, both network
conditions, device sizes, headers,

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.620
all those things.

14
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.520
Find and fix memory leaks in your code,
do a general profile of your code

15
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.880
which includes analyzing JavaScript
performance, finding slow functions.

16
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.599
Profiling also includes
things like page jenks,

17
00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:58.650
so we'll talk about screen paints and
stuff like that.

18
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.530
So basically, kind of a full audit of your
website, which will be network resources,

19
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.090
memory, CPU, all that kind of stuff,
and we're gonna do all that today.

20
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.505
The official docs live here,

21
00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:15.860
developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-de-
vtools.

22
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.115
They're really good, the only thing
is like I said at the beginning,

23
00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:20.783
these things move really quickly.

24
00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:25.109
And so again, if you go to the official
docs, you'll likely see things that

25
00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:29.760
are slightly different visually than
they actually are in your browser.

26
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.750
And I think that's just kind
of always gonna be true.

27
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.195
They really do add stuff,
they move things around a lot.

28
00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:40.494
[COUGH] The two things for those that
didn't get the email that I sent out,

29
00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:43.990
we're gonna be using Chrome Canary today.

30
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.390
For those that haven't used it before,

31
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.060
it's Chrome's kind of like bleeding edge
browser, so it's a separate browser.

32
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.390
Basically, it's the stuff that
they're soon to release, so

33
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.620
it's kinda their beta stuff.

34
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.540
But what's really cool about it is
they're at a lot more liberty to ship

35
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.890
cool things in their developer tools.

36
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.940
So stuff hits Canary long
before it hits Chrome stable.

37
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.300
So I always do my dev tool stuff in
Canary, cuz it's got all the fun tools.

38
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.300
That being said, it's not as stable
as Chrome, so it might just crash.

39
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.320
So we'll see,
we'll cross that bridge if we come to it.

40
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.780
And then the other thing is,
I built this little Node app.

41
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.630
It's really simple.

42
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.760
That would make it fun
to kind of interact.

43
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.060
So all the demos I'm gonna be
doing today are on this Node app.

44
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.676
It's at
mygithub/.jkup/mastering-chrome-devtools.

45
00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:35.826
For anybody that's for
whatever reason not able to get it set up,

46
00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:40.409
I also have it at nodecast.io,
which is a site that I own,

47
00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.330
colon, I think I put it at 4000.

48
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.180
Yep, so if you wanna go ahead and
go to nodecast.io:4000,

49
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.213
you can get kind of a version here.

50
00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:52.090
And this will be good enough to do
most of the stuff we're gonna do.

51
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.090
There's a few things that we're gonna get
into later that do require a local copy,

52
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.520
but this should be helpful for that.
