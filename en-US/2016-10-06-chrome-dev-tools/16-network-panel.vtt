[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.768 --> 00:00:06.892
&gt;&gt; Jon: The network tab is pretty
straightforward compared to some of

3
00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:08.640
the stuff that we've been doing.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.940
So there's a lot going on on the screen.

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.706
The basic thing like I showed before, I'm
gonna go ahead and pop these out to full

6
00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:21.791
screen just so we can see a little bit
better and them a do a page refresh.

7
00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:26.504
So we've got some different things going
on here, we've got a little magnified view

8
00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:30.300
of like what they call the network
waterfall like an asset loading and

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.392
then another one loading and
like you make this bigger.

10
00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:36.874
You'll see these are like really
common patterns you'll see so

11
00:00:36.874 --> 00:00:39.644
you'll see like one bar and
then a bunch of wires and

12
00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:43.040
what's going on here is this one
buyer is your index out HTML.

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.400
And then, as soon as that gets
downloaded it gets parsed.

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.420
And as it gets parsed it's like index.html
is where you keep your scripts and

15
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.430
your links and your style sheets,
all that stuff.

16
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.680
So then it sends out and starts
fetching all these different requests.

17
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.251
With more robust apps you'll see
a way more complicated waterfall but

18
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:04.212
it's basically like each bar is
a file coming over the wire.

19
00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:08.010
And where it starts is the millisecond
that that requests started right.

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.230
So it's like and how wide it is how long
it took to get down so that makes sense.

21
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.290
So wide bars take long to gum down

22
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.310
where they start across the X axis here
is the millisecond that they started.

23
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.850
And then,
the spacing is caused by like if you have

24
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.200
an mark up document that calls a style
sheet and then like that style sheet that

25
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.670
imports another style sheet like these
things are then dependent on each other.

26
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.460
They block on each other and
make this one smaller.

27
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.220
So then a different way of viewing
the same information is this list here.

28
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.920
So it start at the very top always with
the document, type document status.

29
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.620
There's a ton of information here like
you can see the size, how long it took.

30
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.363
So I tend to think, please stop me if I'm
getting confusing with this stuff cuz

31
00:01:58.363 --> 00:02:00.030
there's like a lot to cover here.

32
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.079
So you start with a document, and then it,
this shows you like a very similar and

33
00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.251
we're gonna cover this stuff in a minute
there's like all this information about

34
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:10.669
like not so
the bars with this how long it took but

35
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.960
there's more than that we want to
know why I things take longer.

36
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.040
They can take a long time for a ton of
different reasons like they're really

37
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.885
big the network was slow the server
is slow a bunch of different stuff.

38
00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:24.410
And so, then you can kind of see in order.

39
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.830
You can start scrolling down here and
see every file that was called.

40
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.990
You can also see this initiator
tab which will show you

41
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.830
what file initiated the call for
this file.

42
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.890
So we have a bootstrap that CSS and

43
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.400
the initiator is debugging that HTML,
that makes sense, right?

44
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.420
Like they cause a CSS.

45
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.410
You can see their size.

46
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.390
All these are sortable.

47
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.250
So you can click on them.

48
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.930
The top or bottom sort.

49
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.620
Another nifty dimp tools trick that
I like, is you can hold a shift

50
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.980
over any item, and it will in
the green show you what called it,

51
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.960
and it will in orange or red to show you
what it called seeing it kind of like

52
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.620
it's the same as looking
at initiators basically but

53
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.520
it's kind of like a cool way that you
can like hold shift and look through.

54
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.330
I'm pretty zoomed in so

55
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.790
you can't see a ton of them but it's kinda
cool play around with cool and then.

56
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.852
So that does that make sense.

57
00:03:14.852 --> 00:03:17.324
You kinda see in this waterfall
everything that loads down.

58
00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:18.360
Cool.

59
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.270
So some other cool things here.

60
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.400
They allow the screenshots which I love.

61
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.740
This is back to the how important it is.

62
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.950
Performance and also into the how
complicated performance can be.

63
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.780
So I'm gonna refresh one more time
now recording screenshots with this

64
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.360
camera here.

65
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.134
And what you wanna look for
is basically with your app.

66
00:03:39.134 --> 00:03:40.636
Let me see what's going on.

67
00:03:40.636 --> 00:03:43.091
I think this one's just really fast.

68
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.690
Let's go to Twitter with
screenshots enabled.

69
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.551
So basically, what you wanna look,
got a breakpoint,

70
00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:58.141
is what loads first like how stuff
is coming in, come on breakpoints,

71
00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:03.781
get out of here.
&gt;&gt; Jon: I

72
00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:08.773
think I still have this open
from one of my last examples.

73
00:04:08.773 --> 00:04:10.320
Any XHR.

74
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.880
So basically what you're looking
at with these screenshots here is

75
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.700
as stuff comes in and starts loading,
what does the user get to see?

76
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.310
And this comes back into
this like complication of,

77
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.620
how your app is meant to be presented.

78
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.570
So sometimes you get yourself into
a situation like I said where you're

79
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.190
Blocked downloading Avatar
images that are like

80
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.850
a 1,000 pixels scroll
down from the viewport.

81
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.330
And because the way your markup is set up
you haven't even loaded the welcome text

82
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.570
yet things like that.

83
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.630
So you can use the screen shots to
get a really good idea as your page

84
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.640
this is before the restart, and
then we can see the restart happen and

85
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.280
then we can see like this
is a pretty good example.

86
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.420
So all the text comes in immediately and

87
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.020
then the images start coming in here and
they fade in.

88
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.570
So basically what this is doing is
that snapping a screenshot every time

89
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.270
the screen does a paint of any kind.

90
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.070
And you can get a really good
feel of like how stuff loads.

91
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.780
So this site looks pretty good, I've seen
a lot of sites before where it's just

92
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.180
the way the markup is, it's like white
with one image and it waits until

93
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.940
the whole image loads before it
even starts bringing in the menu or

94
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.460
anything like that, so this is just
like a case by case basis kinda thing.

95
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.270
You also can with this list,
this kind of big

96
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.093
list that we saw,
[SOUND] hide screenshots.

97
00:05:31.093 --> 00:05:33.340
You can sort in a bunch of different ways.

98
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.280
So let's go back to my local host file and
so

99
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.010
what you can do with the sorting is you
can say I like only show me JavaScript and

100
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.600
it will just say the JavaScript files are
like only show me CSS something like that,

101
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.040
that's really helpful and
you can think it's Cmd click,

102
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.230
or I guess Ctrl on Windows Linux
to sort by multiple things.

103
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.220
So you can be like only
show me JavaScript and CSS.

104
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.450
You can also filter if you got
a bunch of different files.

105
00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.098
So you could look for, I don't know, main,

106
00:06:01.098 --> 00:06:03.975
or you can do some actually
regular expressions in here,

107
00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:07.375
too but I'm not gonna get into that now.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you touch on what

108
00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:09.645
the different colors are in the bars?
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah,

109
00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:12.245
that's definitely my next subject, cool.

110
00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:15.285
So I think that's the stuff
I wanted to cover.

111
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.470
I wanted to talk real quick too about this
disable cash making sure you always have

112
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.480
this otherwise you're going to get
bad information because you've got

113
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.220
cash files so you won't get a very good
picture of how your apps loading and

114
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.970
then there's like these
two different views.

115
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.060
So you can hide one or hide the other
if you want just for viewing it.

116
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.649
So let's get into the colors
cuz they're really important.
