00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.166
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:07.352
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Actually, let's let's
do group guided, if we can use words,

3
00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:08.540
where should we start?

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A timeline.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Opening dev tools.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.940
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Opening dev tools,
I like that.

6
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.080
Yeah, we could do the timeline, I am
always torn between timeline and audit,

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.780
and I audit because it's easier.

8
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.930
My brain doesn't like working
my way into this mode.

9
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.453
It's all refreshed and
do on audit of frontendmasters.com.

10
00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:33.598
Okay, so you've got eight scripts
coming down, some of these I don't

11
00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:38.175
think you'll be able to combine is wistia-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Wistia's our video host.

12
00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:42.071
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay, so that you're
probably you do what you have to do,

13
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:46.778
you might be able to make those script
tags a sync or deferred, maybe.

14
00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:49.206
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Did you open
this in incognito, too?

15
00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:49.980
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: No.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Because you

16
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.650
might be logged in.

17
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.340
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I'm not, I checked.

18
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Are you not, okay.

19
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.050
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So yeah,
eight plus the CSS and

20
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.730
plus the document means that
there's going to be more than some

21
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.650
stuff is going to be-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,

22
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.770
I'm surprised that we have five,
I thought we combined those checks.

23
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.410
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Soon we'll do not work
tab some G.'s of stuff again this is

24
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.420
misleading in the sense that these aren't
files that you own like mail munch and

25
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.700
we packs are not things that you
have control over G.'s it being so.

26
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.870
Browser caching, a lot of things don't
have expirations on them like your

27
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.730
pictures and things like that, so
I don't know what you like WordPress or

28
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.380
something like that you can do things.

29
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just piece,
it's just served from a theme.

30
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.470
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

31
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It was like that but
with a source tag.

32
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.900
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, but

33
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.250
like to say I like to be the total cash
could add some max ages, images to it or

34
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.500
something like that, if you wanted
to have browser caching turned on?

35
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,
I think we have W3 total cache.

36
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.050
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: There's also with CMS is
you alway get this issue where you have

37
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.980
plug ins kind of fighting each other
sometimes, so a lot like WordPress.

38
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.150
I see this all the time where
every WordPress plugin has its own

39
00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.760
JavaScript and CSS, right?

40
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.070
You get into this really tricky,

41
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.150
like we keep talking about
important it is to bundle them,

42
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.740
but a lot of times when you're in CMS
land, you don't really have that option.

43
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.020
So, like every plugin wants to look
it's way and function it's way.

44
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.380
It's like a lot of times each plugin you
add brings with it its own JavaScript and

45
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.190
CSS file, and then can't necessarily
be cached by other plugins.

46
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.740
So, it might just be something like that,
these are just things that happen or

47
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.320
whatever, like cookies.

48
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.470
I think that's probably fine.

49
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.721
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: We were serving the static
assets from a CDN which was Kolas/sp,

50
00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:35.630
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Uh-huh.

51
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: But then it was like, to
keep this CDN with the newest version and

52
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.500
sometimes there would be like a day lag.

53
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.780
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I think it was before Amazon

54
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.080
allowed you to purge stuff.

55
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.410
Now you can just purge it, but that
process of deployment is just annoying.

56
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.680
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Totally man.

57
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I'm just making excuses.

58
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.290
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: No hey,
man it's good the site looks fine.

59
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.960
I use it,
everybody here uses it it's a good.

60
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.170
You've got images that
don't have their sizes,

61
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.790
I can just help with the pre-renders and
stuff like that, not a huge deal.

62
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.280
CSS again like these are things that
you'll get, so there's three style blocks,

63
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.440
we can look into those
that are not in the head.

64
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.690
I'm assuming those come from plugins in
some way that are like adding them places.

65
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: All right.

66
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.240
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I've used CSS pros but
again I mean whatever that happens and

67
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.300
it's probably one, so
there's another thing I forgot to mention.

68
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.210
So the unused CSS rules.

69
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.300
It's a problem in the sense that you

70
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.590
can have like a sync like
more mark ups showing up, but

71
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.880
it's also if you only have one C.S.S.
file then you have other pages right?

72
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.800
So it's like there could be rules
that are used on other pages just not

73
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.280
the page that you're on.

74
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.950
And I wouldn't recommend making a C.S.S.

75
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.590
file for each page or I mean that's
just a lot of hassle or whatever.

76
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.270
I think it's OK to send
your style that C.S.S.

77
00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.550
Yeah we've got those things
order of styles and scripts.

78
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.100
These are basically like two two
sides of the same coin or it's saying

79
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.420
like C-S-S files for us to get the highest
priority but you have C-S-S files that

80
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.460
come after JavaScript files so how can I
make the C-S-S a higher priority than.

81
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.400
JavaScript.

82
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.240
So then we take a look
at a network refresh.

83
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.880
We can even take a look
at some screenshots.

84
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.900
Actually, I'll turn those back on and
refresh again.

85
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.740
So kind of see how
everything loads in here.

86
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.230
So this is another weird
caveat with a refresh,

87
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.450
is when you Hit Refresh
to start the recording.

88
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.310
It actually starts the recording
before the page refreshes.

89
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.880
So you'll always see like you not
always but often you'll see a frame or

90
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.830
two and then the white of the refresh
just to keep in mind that like it's

91
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.680
like this is when
the refresh has started but

92
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.440
it hasn't flashed off the content of
the page yet, and then it goes white.

93
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.600
Stays white.

94
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.890
And then at about one second,
I get stuff in.

95
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.430
And this is pretty good in the sense
that I've got stuff to read and

96
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.240
I have a good idea.

97
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.550
I mean, we've got an image in there,
an enroll button comes in right away.

98
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And
the Frontend Masters logo is inlined SVG.

99
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.230
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Nice.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So that's like

100
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.770
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Pretty fast

101
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.760
that's good stuff.

102
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.850
Again like a lot of pages that audit
you know if the logo and the image

103
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.850
were the only thing showing up before all
this got in that would be problematic.

104
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.100
Cut it's good you can read right away
you can click all the important buttons.

105
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.490
You get like that on style content,
I'm not sure where that's coming from but

106
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.010
it's like all.

107
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It's Web Fonts.

108
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.490
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay, yeah.

109
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.359
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That's where
were using Web Fonts for this.

110
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.180
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah I don't know.
So the load looks pretty good to me,

111
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.150
there's some like paints
that are happening again.

112
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.560
But everything above
the fold is good there.

113
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah the paints
that are happening again,

114
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.030
I think is because the video.

115
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.740
Like I basically hook it to unload,
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Right.

116
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: and then I say okay
now dump in more DS scripts,

117
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.155
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

118
00:05:47.155 --> 00:05:47.830
yeah
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: for

119
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.550
the sample video or whatever.

120
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.130
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah totally.

121
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.970
And I think that's great especially cuz
the simple video is below the fold.

122
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Right, so I just wait untill
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

123
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.340
and that's really no hard and
fast rules, like stuff that seems like

124
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.560
bad practices can actually make for
a way better experience because what you,

125
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.190
people need to see they're,
what they can see right away.

126
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Cuz I got the like full
DOM unload on ready or whatever.

127
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.920
From down in like seven or nine seconds
down to one and a half or two or

128
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.750
whatever it was.

129
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.660
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yes, it was really good.

130
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.393
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: By just making sure that
[INAUDIBLE] with you doesn't block and

131
00:06:19.393 --> 00:06:21.580
other stuff doesn't block.

132
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.360
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And
that's always really useful.

133
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.700
People get into the problem
of making everything.

134
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: All of your trade offs that
you just mentioned I wasn't surprised by.

135
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.760
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And
then this seems pretty normal too,

136
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.128
there's a couple things like over here.

137
00:06:37.128 --> 00:06:39.200
Again more A.P.I. stuff.

138
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.500
I mean you see this is just a lot when
you've got like You have your I frame or

139
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.910
you have your script source and
it hit it eight block.

140
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.130
So it gets in there right away but

141
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.540
then it has like all of its
bootstrapping to do right.

142
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.370
So it's like YouTube You have your
little I frame that's all you put in for

143
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.880
the YouTube but
as soon as that gets parse it goes out and

144
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.970
it's like give me some huge JavaScript
a bunch of images and a bunch of do C.S.

145
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.250
and they you know so it drags on.

146
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.390
So you see this kind of pattern area of
like your initial page load this waterfall

147
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.300
And then you have a little bit of spotting
is that it's like a bunch of new stuff and

148
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.100
you know I mean it keeps kind
of that this way of going.

149
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I hate segment
because it's like it's nice for

150
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.080
our marketers because they can just
like inject Mail munch or whatever and

151
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:27.770
like an accident the marketers can inject
Remarketing scripts and stuff like that.

152
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.580
Analytics mix kinda.

153
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.890
All the stuff, right?

154
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.490
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So I think the lesson
here, and this is almost always true is,

155
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.220
it's probably not gonna be like,
my JavaScript functions are too slow.

156
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.270
It's almost always gonna be like,
that ad platform or

157
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:48.810
that analytics company that we have
to use or I did the intelligence for

158
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:53.340
ads on Twitter that was one of
my big fights was always the ad

159
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.380
team wants to know everything and get all
this data and I'm Okay you can have it,

160
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.700
but you can have it later you're
not going to get it right away.

161
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.700
So I think it's like this is really common
I mean it's again it's just the embeds or

162
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.350
it's like they provide a really
rich user experience but

163
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.510
they provide it at a cost, and.

164
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah, segments,
it's easy to just click a switch and

165
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.111
drop in some code-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: [CROSSTALK]

166
00:08:16.111 --> 00:08:16.832
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It just loads

167
00:08:16.832 --> 00:08:18.740
200 kilobytes of JavaScript.

168
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.037
Anyways.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Sorry if you've covered

169
00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:26.400
this but could you just remind me
what the vertical blue and red bars.

170
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.320
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah
those are the two events.

171
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.480
Dom content loaded and then on load.

172
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.575
So it's like showing you When those fire,

173
00:08:33.575 --> 00:08:38.285
I don't think I did cover that showing
you when those fire and that so

174
00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:42.525
anything you do in JavaScript like on Dom
content loaded will happen at that point.

175
00:08:42.525 --> 00:08:44.985
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I also think
that we're using VWO

176
00:08:46.815 --> 00:08:48.795
which I think is why we're getting so

177
00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:51.415
much distance between the blue and red
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: OK.

178
00:08:51.415 --> 00:08:58.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Because VWO the marketing
guys will take a piece of,

179
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.920
marketing guys with you know
piece of the home page and

180
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:09.130
swap out content and then that
will affect how many users click,

181
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.130
and how many potential customers
click to the next Thing or

182
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.900
whatever so there always
measuring conversion rates and

183
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.020
messing with context and titles and-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So here's

184
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.370
an interesting one as far as color goes I
know I said on productions site you'll see

185
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.680
a lot more color variation, but we're
actually not seeing that much more here.

186
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.890
But we're seeing one interesting one,
I don't see a lot of purple So

187
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.770
I could talk about before this script
is actually coming down the pipeline

188
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.720
really fast but we're stalled out waiting
on the S-S-L handshake to finish.

189
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.760
And so it's like this is what is
a pipe dream that wisteria dot com So

190
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.560
it's like it's getting in
the queue really quickly

191
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.290
the actual request sent after the S-S-L
handshake is finished having really fast.

192
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.070
Time to first bite looks good but

193
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.700
look at we're spending like you
know one hundred milliseconds.

194
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.810
I'm waiting for the SSL handshakes that's
you know that's like their sides every

195
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.120
issue but interesting not just green and
blue and grey everywhere.

196
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.310
Yeah I don't there's a pretty good and

197
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.890
then we could do a timeline out as
well as well go Whole enchilada.

198
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.279
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Has anybody tried VWO or
used it for AV testing?

199
00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:18.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I have.

200
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.080
It's a double edged sword.

201
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It's a double edged sword,
yeah.

202
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.340
It makes everything load slower,
but at the same time you can test.

203
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: I wanna do the AV test
to see how many of my potential buyers

204
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.570
drop off before they've actually
loaded their experiment.

205
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.290
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Looks like we've
got some memory leak in here.

206
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That's
actually get a good AV test.

207
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.620
One without VWO and one with.

208
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.800
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: This isn't
the jigsaw that we've seen before but

209
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.740
the JS Heap is just getting bigger and
bigger and bigger.

210
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.440
So one thing I'd check actually what I'd
like to do is see if it's just like Bigger

211
00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.470
until the page loads in the maybe it stops
getting bigger or whether it keeps going.

212
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.470
So instead of recording it on
a refreshed I'm going to record it.

213
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.570
Now that it's just sitting here and

214
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.060
give it a couple seconds see if
memory still leaking because you know

215
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.820
as an absolute strapped it's not uncommon
to see the memory go up what you want to

216
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.370
know is like does it finally settle at
some point or does it just keep going.

217
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.300
So stop that.

218
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: It settles like three
seconds, and drops back down.

219
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:23.510
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool.
Okay, so

220
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.440
yeah there's like, yeah you're right.

221
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.530
So at a certain point there's
like a huge GC happens,

222
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.790
right and
it clears all that JavaScript tip.

223
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.450
But it does appear to start
building back up again

224
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.770
I would again,
this is like choose your battles, right?

225
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.010
The bootstrapping is fine,
it's whatever your app has to do.

226
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.480
It drops back down, and then it starts
crawling, but it is garbage collecting.

227
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.570
But you can see that it is
jigsawing a little bit.

228
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:54.240
So it's jigsawing a little bit, but
it's Going very slowly over time so

229
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.800
I don't know I might wanna, I would
look into this probably a little bit but

230
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.500
it's low heap usage and it's slow growth.

231
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.410
So it's not as like the examples
I had were like these ridiculous

232
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.650
jigsaws you know.

233
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.390
It was kind of interesting.

234
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.710
Let's hide the memory,
hide the screenshots.

235
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.690
I'll do a refresh again,
just to get that initial paint load and

236
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:16.520
all that kind of stuff.

237
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It's like someone
digging through your dirty laundry.

238
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.120
Why is this one so dirty?

239
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.260
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So we do see a good
amount of repaints, again I would imagine,

240
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.800
yeah this is like exactly what we just
talked about like we see a sum paid junk

241
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.490
It's when segments loading
Google Ads Facebook Google Analytics

242
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.670
intercom you know it's like all
this stuff is coming in and

243
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.110
it's really kind of whenever you have
any like third party thing right.

244
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.160
Like I said you have one I frame or
one script.

245
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.130
That's on your page.

246
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.680
But as soon as that gets parsed,

247
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.640
right, the company sends all their little
minions over to start bootstrapping.

248
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.220
Then it's like, here's my style sheet and
here's a whole bunch of documents.

249
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.330
It's just how everything works.

250
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.030
So again, tradeoffs.

251
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.110
There's a bunch of really, really useful
stuff that I'm sure helps the business.

252
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.870
But you can see that it has a pretty
big impact on page performance.

253
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.040
Again-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah inner com is just

254
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.250
like so big but
it's like the best tool in the world.

255
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.080
It's amazing.

256
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.760
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I mean I think, that's
almost always is gonna be the case, right.

257
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.050
Like the most like feature rich,
user friendly,

258
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.350
awesome thing,
I mean that comes at a cost, right.

259
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.450
It's gonna be a lot of code.

260
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:25.020
So yeah.
I don't know.

261
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.920
I don't know again like Using the CPU
is that's what it's there for,

262
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.130
it's there to be used.

263
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:34.320
I might worry about the page jank except
for when we saw, I mean we can do another

264
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.370
here and just make sure that
it's final turn paint flashing.

265
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.580
And we don't see any problems here.

266
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.440
So if the page jank is happening but
it's happening down lower,

267
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.530
it's really not something that I
would worry about all that much.

268
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.040
We saw a green flash for For
a second when the model came up.

269
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.420
But this doesn't seem bad to me.

270
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.420
So if it's like, if the page is
loading fine which we saw and

271
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.430
there's a bunch of junkies
stuff going on down low.

272
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.750
Do you really need to worry about it?

273
00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.800
I mean the only way somebody would
see it is if they hit the page and

274
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.660
scroll immediately,

275
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.610
they would see the video coming junky,
but I think it's less of a concern.

276
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.950
Just because it's out of the view port.

277
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.410
Cool, I don't know, it seems good.

278
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.110
I guess if it were me,
I would beg to cut some of

279
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.270
the bad stuff to see if we
could get any wins there and

280
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.690
then I'd investigate that memory leak but
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Many marketing is

281
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:22.340
so effective.

282
00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.300
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, I know,
you're going I'm just saying,

283
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.070
if it were me those are the things I would
do, does anybody want to take a look at

284
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:27.780
the other one
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,

285
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.630
there's
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: No yes I told questions.

286
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Is there
a way to get like a Y.

287
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:39.710
axis on this memory graph so we can see
how much memory it's actually taking on?

288
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.590
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So you can see how much
is taken up by hovering over the line.

289
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.980
So you can see like how many nodes or
how big the JS [INAUDIBLE] is in bytes.

290
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.480
But I don't think you
can change the UI but

291
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.530
you can you can see this is like,
whatever, 37,

292
00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:00.280
33 million bytes and I'm bad at math, but
you can see you can see the numbers there.
