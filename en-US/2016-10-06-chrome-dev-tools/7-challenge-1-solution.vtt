[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.635
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We're gonna go
over the challenge results.

3
00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:08.950
But first, there are a couple of different
things that I just kind of wanted to

4
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.846
address to everybody that got pointed out.

5
00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:13.320
Some of the finickiness that
I was mentioning earlier.

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.610
One thing a couple people were
having problems with is that they

7
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.460
would make the changes.

8
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.570
And the changes would actually persist
to disk if you opened you text editor.

9
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.490
But on a refresh, it wasn't showing.

10
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.700
So if you had that,
I'm assuming it's just a caching issue.

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.079
So what you can try is, and
this is skipping ahead just a bit,

12
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.012
cuz we are gonna cover this later.

13
00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:39.170
But over here on the network tab,
You can click Disable cache.

14
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.550
And so this is really handy.

15
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.380
We will cover this,

16
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.070
but basically it's saying never
cache when the DevTools are open.

17
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.261
So the DevTools are closed,
you'll still get your normal experience.

18
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:50.729
But you won't cache when the DevTools
are open, which is usually what you want.

19
00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.190
If you're doing performance analysis,
you don't want to bunch of stuff cached.

20
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.010
This can also, I think,
be accessed from the the three dots, and

21
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.120
then Settings, over here.

22
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.182
Well, maybe not.

23
00:01:03.182 --> 00:01:05.870
All right,
get it from the Network tab over here.

24
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.890
So that was one thing.

25
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.489
You can also, if it's not working,
you can Ctrl+C the note app, and

26
00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:12.810
then just start it again.

27
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.390
I don't think stuff should be caching
that much, but it definitely was for

28
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.370
some people.

29
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.972
Another thing that was pointed out,
and I'm not sure why this is.

30
00:01:18.972 --> 00:01:22.150
Is that when you're in the Sources tab,

31
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.980
like adding a new selector
isn't persisting to disk.

32
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.900
So if you wanted to like add one for
li's, or for h1, something like that,

33
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.199
that's not gonna save.

34
00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:32.674
I'm not sure why that doesn't work.

35
00:01:32.674 --> 00:01:34.090
It feels like it should.

36
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.834
But that is why I made a bunch
of empty selectors here.

37
00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:41.895
I don't know if people caught that,
but I made an empty list selector and

38
00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:44.371
then up here I made
empty header selectors.

39
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:48.210
Just to make the demo
a little bit more endurable.

40
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.546
The last one, or maybe, actually,
there are a couple more.

41
00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:54.924
[LAUGH] The Event Listener,
one you can totally just see.

42
00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:58.220
Some people went the network route and
saw what JavaScript was coming down,

43
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.950
which is great.

44
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.360
You can also just go to this
Event Listeners tab, over here.

45
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270
And see what is listening on scroll.

46
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.516
So you could see like,
the editing.js is listening on scroll.

47
00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:10.370
And then click, and
it'll open it in the sources.

48
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.547
So I was kind of what I was hoping with.

49
00:02:13.547 --> 00:02:16.800
And then you had something I
can't remember what was broken.

50
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.867
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It was the computer

51
00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.745
disappeared [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah,

52
00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:22.500
you had two things.

53
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.503
One, finding that color
changes weren't persisting,

54
00:02:25.503 --> 00:02:28.262
in the sense that if you change the color,
it stays.

55
00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:31.556
But if you change the color format,
it's not persisting.

56
00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:35.170
Feels like it should do that,
but that doesn't seem to stay.

57
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.650
And then the second one,
which is really weird,

58
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.080
is this Computed styles
tab which I mentioned.

59
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.564
He was noticing that if you
pin it to the side over here,

60
00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:47.490
computed styles is just gone.

61
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.360
Even though there's plenty of room for
it to be there, like here.

62
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.937
So that's really strange to me.

63
00:02:53.937 --> 00:02:54.909
I'm not sure why that is.

64
00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.284
So if anybody's having trouble
finding computed styles.

65
00:02:57.284 --> 00:03:00.590
I guess it needs to either
be docked to the bottom or

66
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.360
popped out in order to get access to that.

67
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.130
Cool, so that being said,
we can go through and

68
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.095
do the exercise together a little bit.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I got a couple more

69
00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:12.880
questions really quick.

70
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.462
Right after we broke,
John C asked a question.

71
00:03:17.462 --> 00:03:22.183
If we nav a plain HTML file, will changes
to text nodes or additional removal of

72
00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:25.593
attributes be persisted to disk as well?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: They will not.

73
00:03:25.593 --> 00:03:28.924
So this is a CSS- and
JavaScript-only zone.

74
00:03:28.924 --> 00:03:34.320
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

75
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.899
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay, cool, yeah, let me

76
00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:36.286
know.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Another question,

77
00:03:36.286 --> 00:03:38.059
what's a HSL?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah,

78
00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.974
it's like-

79
00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:39.524
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Hue saturation.
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]

80
00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:42.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Something designers

81
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.747
sometimes prefer.
Yeah, and

82
00:03:46.747 --> 00:03:51.177
then I'm never sure what
the differences are, but yeah.

83
00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:54.700
Okay, so, cool,
to kind of go through these quickly.

84
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.700
So I select the body, go to Styles,
and then I can go ahead down here.

85
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.419
And just change the background and
I tab complete to EEE.

86
00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.756
List items having no bullet points,
so I put a class on,

87
00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:09.611
if we dive in a little bit here.

88
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:18.676
Let me make that even bigger.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Well, I guess I can't.

89
00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:21.328
This is one case where I won't
be able to make it bigger.

90
00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:25.007
Man, I'm really, really freezing here.

91
00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:26.402
Okay, there we go.

92
00:04:26.402 --> 00:04:28.998
So if we dive in a little bit, here,
you can see it's got a class of list.

93
00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:32.082
Which is one of those empty
selectors I gave you.

94
00:04:32.082 --> 00:04:33.152
This is, by the way,

95
00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:37.080
what I was referring to when I said I went
a week without using any other editor.

96
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.720
This is one of the big pain points.

97
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.488
This is like, I can't add a new
selector and have it persist.

98
00:04:41.488 --> 00:04:43.762
I need some way to do that.

99
00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:49.980
So then you could do list-style,
none here, h1 should be 50 pixels.

100
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.131
You click on any h1, again,
all of these could be done multiple ways.

101
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:57.980
I kind of prefer this approach in
the elements, and Style's open.

102
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.340
You could just as easily have
gone to Sources, open up the CSS,

103
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.290
and author the changes that way.

104
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.840
So you could do like, font-size, 50 px.

105
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.819
I have like a little, yeah.

106
00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.071
Creating a new div,
that's one that's a little bit tricky.

107
00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:15.371
So you have a couple of different options.

108
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:18.730
One is that whole edit as HTML
thing that I was showing earlier.

109
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.685
So you can like right-click, maybe,
on the parent one, edit as HTML,

110
00:05:23.685 --> 00:05:27.420
and then you've got this
very condensed code.

111
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.689
So if we kinda maybe
give it some space there,

112
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.300
you could just make a new,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: My

113
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.041
goodness.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: div with an ID of box, or

114
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:43.228
whatever, and
then just click outside of it to save.

115
00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:47.147
It makes this little blue box, here.

116
00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:49.606
Find the scroll listener,
that one I just covered.

117
00:05:49.606 --> 00:05:53.441
But you can go to Event Listeners,
scroll, and find it there, and

118
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:55.320
then click through to the file.

119
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.359
Convert the body background to HSL.

120
00:05:57.359 --> 00:06:00.136
So you could do this
a couple of different ways.

121
00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:05.009
But click on the body, and then you can
either Shift+click on it until it changes.

122
00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.478
Or you could click on it to open
this up and change it into HSLA.

123
00:06:08.478 --> 00:06:12.270
And then, yes, some other changing things.

124
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.668
Just kinda wanted to
get people comfortable.

125
00:06:13.668 --> 00:06:16.389
So it's, no.

126
00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.862
[LAUGH] This is funny.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's already set.

127
00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:19.873
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: My bad on that one.

128
00:06:19.873 --> 00:06:25.790
[LAUGH] I build this site, and it was ten
columns wide for those who use Bootstrap.

129
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.421
And then I think it's
was yesterday afternoon,

130
00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:30.600
I was like, well, kind of looks better
at eight, but I forgot to change this.

131
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.204
So here's a freebie, but, yeah,
you could if you wanted to.

132
00:06:33.204 --> 00:06:35.291
You can go ahead and
change the classes like this.

133
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:38.957
You could have it be like,
ten columns offset by one.

134
00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:42.718
And then when you hit Enter,
you'll notice that it gets bigger.

135
00:06:42.718 --> 00:06:44.750
So you can do that.

136
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.970
How long the page takes to load on a 2G
connection, I'm really sorry, you guys.

137
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.332
There are a couple of
these I didn't cover.

138
00:06:49.332 --> 00:06:52.869
We're gonna get into this
right after this workshop.

139
00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:55.051
And then force the link
to show its hover states.

140
00:06:55.051 --> 00:06:58.820
So you could, a bunch different ways to do
this, but you could use this little tool.

141
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.117
Then you could grab the link, then you
could go to hover, and click hover on it.

142
00:07:03.117 --> 00:07:04.350
At least, that's one way to do it.

143
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.240
And then put me in the list, again.

144
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.520
Multiple different ways you could do it.

145
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.920
One cool little trick,
which I hadn't shown, yet.

146
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.950
But I really like is these
are actually drag and droppable,

147
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.019
which is much easier than edit as HTMLs.

148
00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:21.500
So you can long-click on one,
like hold it there, and then, yeah.

149
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.291
You'll start getting these blue
lines where you can drag it and

150
00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:26.520
drop it somewhere.

151
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.853
Alternatively, you could just add
edit as HTML, and copy/paste it, or

152
00:07:29.853 --> 00:07:30.892
something like that.

153
00:07:30.892 --> 00:07:34.480
Cool, sorry about the 2G connection one.

154
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.070
So hopefully that got you a little
bit comfortable messing around with

155
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.670
those things.
