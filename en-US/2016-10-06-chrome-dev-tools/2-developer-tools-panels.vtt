[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.169
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: Let's do a quick
walk-through of all the panels,

3
00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:08.640
get to know what they're good for,
things like that.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.902
And you can feel free to
ask any questions, but

5
00:00:10.902 --> 00:00:14.441
do know that we are gonna do a deep dive
into each one of the panels as we go.

6
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:18.340
So I'm gonna go ahead and
open up the developer tools on my project.

7
00:00:23.817 --> 00:00:29.020
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: Which is here and
I'm wanna keep them as large as I can.

8
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.499
There might be times just because there's
a lot of competing information, so there

9
00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.833
may be times I have to make them a little
bit smaller just to show the whole screen.

10
00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.700
But we'll go ahead and
start with the elements panel.

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.644
So this is what we talked
about at the beginning.

12
00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:42.143
I should actually cover For

13
00:00:42.143 --> 00:00:46.120
those that I have never used them
before the way to open the dev tools.

14
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.209
You have a couple of choices.

15
00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:50.240
You can right click anywhere on
the document and click inspect and

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.870
that will open them up.

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.521
There's also a handy keyboard shortcuts.

18
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:57.557
Like I always use a Command+Optioned+J
to open them up in the console and

19
00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:01.210
there's like Command+Option+I
open them up in the elements.

20
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.917
And that's I think it's ctrl+shift+J and
I for Linux and Windows users.

21
00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:07.610
That's how I get it open.

22
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.139
The elements panels,
the first one we gonna talk about and

23
00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:12.520
this is basically what we
discussed at the beginning.

24
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.500
So this is like an interpreted Dom and
it's really cool.

25
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.509
You can do a ton of stuff
that will cover later.

26
00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.460
You can kind of drill into
all the markup on your site.

27
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.479
You can see comments classes.

28
00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.790
You can change stuff by
double clicking into it.

29
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.137
And so that's all the markup and
HTML on the left.

30
00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:34.410
And then on the right is all the CSS that
applies, and again, really interactive.

31
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.935
You can change the actual selector,
you can change properties,

32
00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:42.304
you can add new properties, and we're
gonna do a bunch of stuff with that later.

33
00:01:42.304 --> 00:01:45.942
There's also a lot of other things
here which are really handy.

34
00:01:45.942 --> 00:01:49.515
We're gonna cover computed styles in
depth, but you can see all the event

35
00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:52.292
listeners on your current page
which can be really nice.

36
00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:55.357
So you can see like what's
listening on click and

37
00:01:55.357 --> 00:01:59.843
you can see that bootstrap.js says
I don't know I'm a slow counter but

38
00:01:59.843 --> 00:02:03.915
maybe 12 different click listeners and
you can look at those.

39
00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:06.672
We'll cover dom break points later, but

40
00:02:06.672 --> 00:02:10.310
you can do some pretty cool
debugging stuff from here.

41
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.020
And then same with like properties.

42
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.454
You can take a look at like all
the different, pseudo elements,

43
00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:16.951
all the different ,regular
elements ,nodes things like that.

44
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.630
So that's the elements page.

45
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.189
Probably the most or

46
00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.061
second most common used panel to
sketch your HTML and your CSS.

47
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.330
The next one is the network panel.

48
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.854
There's kind of a lot going on here and
we will talk a ton about it.

49
00:02:30.854 --> 00:02:35.581
But basically, if you do a page
refresh with the network panel open,

50
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:39.903
you get this really handy waterfall
which is essentially every

51
00:02:39.903 --> 00:02:43.430
single HTTP request that
is made as the page loads.

52
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.725
So you can see if we kind of
make this a little bit bigger,

53
00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:50.245
you can see that the very first
thing to load was a document.

54
00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:51.660
So this is our HTML.

55
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.830
And then it calls out to a stylesheet.

56
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.640
So you can kind of get this waterfall
visual of like how the page is

57
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.317
downloaded and then parsed, right.

58
00:02:58.317 --> 00:03:01.670
So it hits the CSS first,
cuz that's at the top in the head, and

59
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.070
then as we kind of scroll down later,
it hits the JavaScript.

60
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.380
So there's a lot here.

61
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.318
Basically, it's just kind of giving you
this visual representation of how your

62
00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:17.107
page loads and from there, you can sort
it in a bunch of different ways like just

63
00:03:17.107 --> 00:03:20.471
see the JavaScript,
just see the CSS stuff like that.

64
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.462
Cool, the next one is the sources panel.

65
00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:28.180
This is where we gonna get started
with learning how to use dev tools

66
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.159
as your IDE or your editor.

67
00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.910
It actually looks a lot like an editor.

68
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.297
So you have your file tree over here and
then you have your actual file pane and

69
00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:38.990
you can do things like
command P to open a file.

70
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.960
So I can open like style.css.

71
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.298
And then just we expect in a text editor.

72
00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:49.700
You have all the abilities to edit and
here.

73
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.766
There's also this right panel which we're
gonna talk about in the debugging section.

74
00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.680
This isn't used for authoring code.

75
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.524
This is actually used for step through
debugging and things like that,

76
00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:01.972
so we will get to that but
in the next section.

77
00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:03.380
The next one is the timeline.

78
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.167
The timeline, is probably gonna be the one
that we spend the most time on because it

79
00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:09.561
is the one with more features.

80
00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:12.833
Essentially, just to give you a quick
view of it right now, you can start

81
00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:16.730
a recording, you can do what ever you
want, scroll around and click on stuff.

82
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.077
Then you can hit on stop and
it gives you just a tone of information.

83
00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:26.315
So, basically it allows you to capture
all the network request, do a JAVAscript

84
00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:32.450
profile, gets screenshots of how your site
loads, capture memory, and screen repaint.

85
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.656
So basically as the years have gone on,
more and

86
00:04:34.656 --> 00:04:37.426
more features have made their
way into the timeline panel.

87
00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:40.410
And it's become in my opinion
the most powerful of the panels,

88
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.832
because it actually has,
network has its own tab,

89
00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:46.660
but you can get your network
requests right here in timeline.

90
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.079
Profiles lets you do memory stuff, but

91
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.844
you can get memory stuff
right here in timeline.

92
00:04:49.844 --> 00:04:53.094
So I think we'll probably spend
the most time looking at all

93
00:04:53.094 --> 00:04:54.918
this complicated information.

94
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.244
Profiles are cool.

95
00:04:57.244 --> 00:04:59.970
They let you do f one off.

96
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.670
You can record the JavaScript CPU, and
what we're gonna do with that is we're

97
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.272
gonna be able to look at and find like
what are most expensive functions are?

98
00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:09.610
Where a web app is spending the most time.

99
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.195
You can get this bottom-up
view of all of your code.

100
00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:13.594
Same with memory.

101
00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:16.143
It allows you to take these
heap snapshots which is all

102
00:05:16.143 --> 00:05:19.044
of the stuff the browser has in memory for
your current page.

103
00:05:19.044 --> 00:05:21.530
And it actually lets you compare them,
too.

104
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.975
So if you're looking at memory leaks,
which we'll do later,

105
00:05:24.975 --> 00:05:28.173
you can take a heap snapshot and
then you can do the action.

106
00:05:28.173 --> 00:05:32.290
Send a tweet or
click on somebody's Facebook profile.

107
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.019
Whatever you think is
causing your memory leak,

108
00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:36.348
then you can take another heap
snapshot and you can compare them.

109
00:05:36.348 --> 00:05:37.648
Weâ€™ll do that.

110
00:05:37.648 --> 00:05:38.435
And then yeah,

111
00:05:38.435 --> 00:05:41.778
you can do these cool things with
like look at all the allocation.

112
00:05:41.778 --> 00:05:46.372
And allocation is just like memory
allocated and what it's allocated for.,

113
00:05:46.372 --> 00:05:50.825
So in programming, every time you make
a variable or add an event listener in

114
00:05:50.825 --> 00:05:55.000
JavaScript, all these different
things take some amount of memory.

115
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.330
So we'll be able to look at specifically
what our web app is using and

116
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.240
debug from there, whether it should
be freeing that memory up or not.

117
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.070
Console, probably the second or
first most popular tab.

118
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.610
It gives you an interactive
JavaScript REPL.

119
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.930
REPL is read, evaluate, print, loop.

120
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.181
So you can just type JavaScript code in,
console.log, hello.

121
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.640
And it will evaluate it and
spit it back out for you.

122
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.253
So you can see the hello here.

123
00:06:22.253 --> 00:06:24.246
You can do a lot of stuff in here.

124
00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:27.320
Interacting with elements
from the page is pretty cool.

125
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.221
You can do,
yeah I guess we'll cover it in a bit but

126
00:06:33.221 --> 00:06:36.695
you can do a lot more than
just execute JavaScript code.

127
00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:39.452
But this is also where if
you put any console log or

128
00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:42.545
console error console warn
in your code and you run it,

129
00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:45.860
this is the tab you'll go to
to see what's going on there.

130
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.999
Audits are great.

131
00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:50.620
This is like a much more high level view.

132
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.797
So we took a quick glimpse at some of
the really technical tabs like network and

133
00:06:54.797 --> 00:06:58.348
timeline where you're seeing all
these graphs and statistics.

134
00:06:58.348 --> 00:07:02.325
Audit is like a much more top level
you run an audit on your site and

135
00:07:02.325 --> 00:07:07.114
it gives you some intelligent advice like
it'll say your images are too big or

136
00:07:07.114 --> 00:07:10.003
you have too many CSS files,
stuff like that.

137
00:07:10.003 --> 00:07:13.235
So I find this is a really nice place to
start because you're not really diving

138
00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:14.140
into the thick of it.

139
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.068
You're just kind of looking at some
easy low hanging fruit that you can fix.

140
00:07:18.068 --> 00:07:21.780
And then the last two
are actually both new.

141
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.966
For those that have used the dev tools,
up until last week,

142
00:07:24.966 --> 00:07:28.745
you are probably familiar with
the resources panel which is now gone.

143
00:07:28.745 --> 00:07:31.715
It's still in Chrome stable,
but it's gone in Chrome Canary.

144
00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:34.795
And it's been replaced with
this application panel.

145
00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:37.086
Application's pretty cool.

146
00:07:37.086 --> 00:07:42.009
What resources did for those that
didn't know is it allowed you to view

147
00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:46.024
all of the basically allocated
storage on your website.

148
00:07:46.024 --> 00:07:50.969
Cookies, session data, anybody that's
using a cool, I don't know if you've used

149
00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:55.480
index db before but it's like an in
browser database that you can use.

150
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.290
So resources used to be like
the place to go if you wanted to see

151
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.130
like if your session was
being set correctly or

152
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.680
how much data was being kept in your
cookies or something like that.

153
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.485
All that's still here in applications.

154
00:08:07.485 --> 00:08:11.800
So you can look through and
see if you have any data in here.

155
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.485
But now it also has support for

156
00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:17.869
two different things which are we're
not really gonna covered in depth about

157
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:21.799
service workers which allow you to
build apps that can work offline.

158
00:08:21.799 --> 00:08:26.016
And app manifests which is this
idea coming from Google which

159
00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:30.480
allows you to have this little
metadata for your application.

160
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.326
And if you have one of
those on Android devices,

161
00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:37.326
you can save web pages as though
they're apps to your home screen.

162
00:08:37.326 --> 00:08:41.010
So it's kind of this way
that things are moving.

163
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.561
So all that's f been added
to this new application tab,

164
00:08:43.561 --> 00:08:47.103
which I'm very happy about because
researches was my least favorite panel.

165
00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:49.210
That wasn't super useful before.

166
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.466
And then the last one is also
new is a security panel.

167
00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.800
And so this is just really
going to tell you two things.

168
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.291
Do you have an SSL certificate,
which I don't on this local server, and

169
00:08:59.291 --> 00:09:01.132
it's gonna tell you that you should.

170
00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:06.216
And then also for those familiar with
security, just because you have an HTTPS

171
00:09:06.216 --> 00:09:10.773
for your site, it doesn't mean every
asset on the site is over HTTPS.

172
00:09:10.773 --> 00:09:14.549
So think for example,
if you have a website on HP's and

173
00:09:14.549 --> 00:09:19.569
you're pulling some JavaScript from a CDN,
that's just H-T-T-P.

174
00:09:19.569 --> 00:09:23.730
Or you're including a video and
I frame would be really dangerous.

175
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.020
So this gonna tell you,

176
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.470
does your site have it which you could
just look up here and see if you have it.

177
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.380
But it's also gonna look
at all the assets and

178
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.790
make sure that every single one of
those assets is a cell enabled.

179
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.470
So yeah, so
that's the really high level overview.

180
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.138
We are gonna definitely talk a lot
about each one of those tabs.

181
00:09:40.138 --> 00:09:43.478
I just wanted to give you a feel for
what they do.

182
00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:47.520
Another cool thing in Canary,
I'm not sure if it's in Stable yet.

183
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.664
But you can actually drag these
tabs around now and they persist.

184
00:09:51.664 --> 00:09:55.187
So you can set them in whatever
order you would like them to be in.

185
00:09:55.187 --> 00:09:58.142
And this is particularly annoying for

186
00:09:58.142 --> 00:10:01.842
me because Console was
always really far away.

187
00:10:01.842 --> 00:10:05.409
And I remember at Twitter, all of
our automated tests would run in and

188
00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:07.330
I'm gonna show you this real quick.

189
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.537
This little three buttons up here
allows you to pin them differently.

190
00:10:10.537 --> 00:10:13.138
So you can pin,
the dev tools come pinned to the bottom.

191
00:10:13.138 --> 00:10:15.322
You can pin them to the side like this or

192
00:10:15.322 --> 00:10:18.542
you can pop them out into your
own full screen like this.

193
00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:21.694
Use your own discretion and you know
whatever you need screen space wise.

194
00:10:21.694 --> 00:10:25.089
On Twitter, our test would run like
this and Console was too far off that

195
00:10:25.089 --> 00:10:28.441
I couldn't click on it so I couldn't
see any of my Console log errors.

196
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:31.601
So I love that you can drag these
around now cuz if you need Console,

197
00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:35.230
just drag it to the very beginning and
you'll have it there.

198
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.586
So yeah,
there's some other stuff we'll cover.

199
00:10:38.586 --> 00:10:40.880
You can take a look at
the keyboard shortcuts.

200
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.340
There's all sorts of cool settings.

201
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.783
We're gonna get into experiments later
which allows you to actually try out

202
00:10:45.783 --> 00:10:49.602
the stuff that they're actively developing
which is where we may see some crashes,

203
00:10:49.602 --> 00:10:50.960
but it'll be fun.

204
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.983
And then I think the last
thing I wanted to talk

205
00:10:53.983 --> 00:10:57.095
about in this overview
is actually over here.

206
00:10:57.095 --> 00:11:01.640
Let me close this little settings
here which is device simulation.

207
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.137
This is one thing that's gonna look
dramatically different on Chrome Stable

208
00:11:05.137 --> 00:11:06.115
from Chrome Canary.

209
00:11:06.115 --> 00:11:10.176
But basically, this allows you
to go into this emulation mode.

210
00:11:10.176 --> 00:11:14.442
Let me go ahead and I'm gonna, one thing I
do a lot is I'll pop the dev tools out so

211
00:11:14.442 --> 00:11:15.728
they're full screen.

212
00:11:15.728 --> 00:11:20.530
And then I use Cmd+~ to
toggle just to Chrome.

213
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.968
So the DevTools are open but
they're hidden right now.

214
00:11:23.968 --> 00:11:27.867
So basically, this allows you
to simulate different devices.

215
00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:31.625
Itâ€™s really good for testing how
your Apple look, on a mobile device.

216
00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:35.505
Itâ€™s not perfect, so
I always wanna put that caveat out there.

217
00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:38.194
If you care about mobile users,
which you certainly should,

218
00:11:38.194 --> 00:11:40.220
you really need to be
testing on real devices.

219
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.002
That being said,
this gets you pretty far away.

220
00:11:44.002 --> 00:11:46.973
So you can pick a device like an iPhone 6.

221
00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:50.480
You can pick how wide
you'd like to view it.

222
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.261
So 100% of an iPhone 6 would be this.

223
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:55.840
And then it's cool,
you can interact with it a lot.

224
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.467
One thing that's important to point
out is that this is not just changing

225
00:11:59.467 --> 00:12:00.248
the view port.

226
00:12:00.248 --> 00:12:03.890
Itâ€™s actually changing the headers
that your site throws.

227
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:09.288
So for example, if I were to go to I think
like twitter.com throwing this iPhone 6,

228
00:12:09.288 --> 00:12:14.168
it's actually gonna, far as I can
see redirect to mobile.twitter.com.

229
00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:17.150
So it's not the same as dragging
your browser really small,

230
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.770
which changes the view port.

231
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.382
This is actually throwing the same
headers that iPhone 6 will throw.

232
00:12:22.382 --> 00:12:25.112
So you can get apretty close experience.

233
00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:28.205
With that being said I mean,
this is just emulation.

234
00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:31.201
Itâ€™s not actually using a device.

235
00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:32.962
Cool so yeah, I use that a lot.

236
00:12:32.962 --> 00:12:36.537
You can change it from panorama
mode back and forth and

237
00:12:36.537 --> 00:12:41.073
then you can like also even do things
like a responsive design mode.

238
00:12:41.073 --> 00:12:43.060
This is there on just a web header.

239
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.060
But from here,
you can drag your site around and

240
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.072
see how it performs at
different breakpoints.

241
00:12:51.072 --> 00:12:56.174
So I'm gonna click this again to stop
device emulation and then we go ahead.

242
00:12:56.174 --> 00:12:57.880
I'm gonna pin these back
to the bottom here.
