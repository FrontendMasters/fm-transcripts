[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.441
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Now
the scariest of the panels but

3
00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:07.140
we're gonna get through it together.

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.088
And it's gonna be awesome.

5
00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:10.354
The timeline panel.

6
00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:14.112
So the Timeline panel,
I think I have a Lord of the Rings ring,

7
00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:17.023
is like becoming the one
panel to rule them all.

8
00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:19.683
As it were,
has got way too much stuff on it but

9
00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:22.216
it's really really useful information.

10
00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:26.274
So imma pop this back into full screen,
so we can see it all and

11
00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:29.308
basically you can control
what it captures.

12
00:00:29.308 --> 00:00:32.195
We're gonna to start off
by capturing everything and

13
00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:35.310
then we gonna kind of
narrow it down from there.

14
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.150
So it can do network just
like the network tab.

15
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.870
A JavaScript profile, they can do those
screenshots as we load just like we saw

16
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.644
before they can copy, capture all
the memory and all the screen paints.

17
00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:50.964
And I'm gonna go ahead imma hit refresh
on here which will start the recording.

18
00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:54.633
With the timeline, it's actually
true with almost all the panels,

19
00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:58.759
when you're on the panel a refresh will
trigger it to start it's recording.

20
00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:03.604
You can also using command you're clicking
on it, you can manually start and stop or

21
00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:05.995
recording and what that's important for

22
00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:09.899
is a refresh is gonna be profiling
your page load your initial load.

23
00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.106
But sometimes you wanna profile how your
app works like somewhere in the flow

24
00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:17.320
after the page loads to
a single page application.

25
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.967
And you're worried about like
the checkout screen feeling slow.

26
00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:22.023
You don't need to start from page load,

27
00:01:22.023 --> 00:01:25.721
you can just hit record check out hit
record stop and profile it that way.

28
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:28.579
But for now, we're just going to be
profiling the whole page load because this

29
00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:29.516
is a pretty simple site.

30
00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:35.170
Okay, so [COUGH]
go to timeline, I don't know how I got off

31
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.140
here but multiple my gosh,
I have multiple death tool windows open.

32
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.400
Okay, there we go back to has just one.

33
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.899
Okay, so this is the screen and
there's a ton of stuff going on, so

34
00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.163
let's start off with what we can eliminate
and make it smaller just for a minute.

35
00:01:53.163 --> 00:01:58.289
Okay, so [COUGH] the first thing that we
can probably eliminate is the screenshots,

36
00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.893
we already saw these down here
on the network conditions.

37
00:02:01.893 --> 00:02:06.128
And I know that I'm not worried
about how the paint performs.

38
00:02:06.128 --> 00:02:10.499
What you would wanna watch out for here is
like I said before if maybe unimportant

39
00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:14.414
stuff like an image was loading before
important stuff like a tagline or

40
00:02:14.414 --> 00:02:15.670
some communication.

41
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.300
Screenshots are really useful for that,
but since I can see that my whole page

42
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.460
loads right away in the first screenshot,
I don't need those anymore.

43
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.830
So I'm gonna deselect to
kinda tidy up a little bit.

44
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.140
The next thing then
we'll look at is memory.

45
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.270
We're gonna get in the memory
in the next section but

46
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.180
the thing you wanna watch out for
a memory is like the jigsaw pattern.

47
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.404
So it's like memory going up is totally
fine cuz you need memory to do basically

48
00:02:39.404 --> 00:02:43.884
everything, but what you wanna look for is
every once in a while garbage collection

49
00:02:43.884 --> 00:02:46.254
kicks in and
the memory should go back down.

50
00:02:46.254 --> 00:02:48.892
Preferably back down
to a pretty low point,

51
00:02:48.892 --> 00:02:52.330
if you see your memory like jigsawing so
up into the left.

52
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.642
That's the bad sign because that means
the flat is the garbage collection which

53
00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:57.810
should go back down.

54
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.664
So we'll see it soon but the pattern
that you always wanna watch out for

55
00:03:01.664 --> 00:03:05.839
is like the up and to the left memory
provides, so we can see and hear is very,

56
00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:06.971
very flat, right?

57
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:08.171
Like the page loads and

58
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:12.721
it probably allocate some memory a garbage
collection kicks in and it doesn't go back

59
00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:16.960
down to zero because we have stuff in
memory still but it stays really flat.

60
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.091
Whereas, if you are seeing like [SOUND]
that kind of pattern, you'd have a memory

61
00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:25.179
leak, and that's thing you wanna
diagnose there, that's our next section.

62
00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.099
So we can see there's not
a memory leak on this page, so

63
00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.856
I'm gonna go ahead and
not look at that right now.

64
00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:35.500
I did wanna point out that their color
coordinated by the type of what the memory

65
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.990
is being used for, which is really
gonna be helpful on our next section.

66
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.860
Whether it's like DOM nodes or elements or
JavaScript or event listeners all like us,

67
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.790
so it's gonna hide memory.

68
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.385
Okay, so now,
we're just down to three things.

69
00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:50.540
We're down to the summary down here.

70
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.974
We're down to the networks,
which is basically the waterfall

71
00:03:53.974 --> 00:03:58.360
that we saw before, and
then we're down to the screen paint area.

72
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.810
So the network is really useful like
if you have a website that slow and

73
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.600
you're looking at the timeline and you're
seeing that like let's say, you're seeing.

74
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.463
So these little red blips here are when
when Chrome suspects what's called

75
00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:19.171
page jank which we're gonna get into
in a bit which is like a jankness like

76
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:20.731
not silky smooth page.

77
00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:26.075
So if you're seeing a lot of page jank and
you're not seeing anything here, so these

78
00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:32.310
are again color coordinated like loading
JavaScript we'll get into that a second.

79
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.960
So if you're not seeing any stuff here,
but you're seeing jank up here,

80
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.430
it's probably a good idea to
look into the network resources.

81
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.826
Like, for example,
you have one huge image.

82
00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:44.854
You might see no work being done, so
none of these little pyramids but

83
00:04:44.854 --> 00:04:47.880
a whole lot of pages like
the images loading in.

84
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.220
But for this one, the areas that we
do see a little bit of page jank,

85
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.030
we also see a lot of work going on, so
networking is probably not our issue.

86
00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.668
The controls are a little bit weird on
the timeline too so if you scroll down it,

87
00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:04.483
zooms in and you can kind of see
these two pictures here zooming in.

88
00:05:04.483 --> 00:05:08.583
And you can zoom in an area and
if you scroll side to side,

89
00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:12.781
if you have a trackpad it moves
it through time the X axis.

90
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:16.113
But then when you get to something
like here and you wanna scroll down,

91
00:05:16.113 --> 00:05:18.216
if you try to scroll down it won't, right?

92
00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:22.036
It will just zoom back out and
in when you try to zoom down and up, so

93
00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:25.663
just remember the timeline kind
of takes over the scrolling.

94
00:05:25.663 --> 00:05:29.234
And if you want normal scrolling,
you have to hold Shift, and

95
00:05:29.234 --> 00:05:33.230
if you hold Shift you'll be able to
scroll up and down, like normal.

96
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.745
So again, the Network tab is
useful in a sense because it can

97
00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:40.558
show us things that take a long time.

98
00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:44.931
And the really only thing that's taking a
long time is these icon fonts to load and

99
00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:48.810
those icon fonts are just what I'm
using for these little things here.

100
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.043
So if we wanted an immediate
awesome performance win and

101
00:05:52.043 --> 00:05:56.735
we're okay with not having those icons we
could just get rid of this whole thing.

102
00:05:56.735 --> 00:05:59.125
This is like the Bootstrap cliff icons,

103
00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:02.638
we could also very easily trim
the CSS down to just the five or

104
00:06:02.638 --> 00:06:06.734
six that I'm using as opposed to
like 32 that come with Bootstrap.

105
00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:09.868
But there's nothing really like
what you'd wanna watch out for

106
00:06:09.868 --> 00:06:13.466
on the Network tab is like some really
wide stuff especially these are okay

107
00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:15.225
cuz they load at the end you can see.

108
00:06:15.225 --> 00:06:18.861
But if it was like something that was like
blocking in the middle like the document

109
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:21.814
comes down and then this huge image
where no work is getting done.

110
00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:24.681
And then JavaScript like that's the kind
of stuff you wanna watch out for

111
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:27.175
on the Network tab and
we'll see some examples of that in a bit.

112
00:06:27.175 --> 00:06:29.770
But I'm not concerned with this,
does that kinda makes sense?

113
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.380
Cuz I'm not seeing any red
flags with this Network tab, so

114
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.320
I'm wanna go ahead and hide it for now.

115
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.640
Okay, so now we're just left
with still a lot of stuff.

116
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.000
So as far as the colors for

117
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.580
all the rest of the panels they're
dictated by this key here.

118
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.394
So loading is blue, scripting is yellow,
rendering is purple,

119
00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:54.791
painting is green, and
then everything else.

120
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:59.592
And other and idle are just like GPU or
CPU, it has like stuff to do, right?

121
00:06:59.592 --> 00:07:01.988
There's like actual native
code that it's running,

122
00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:04.340
there's actually like
browser cleanup happening.

123
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.770
So that's like not your app code, so you
kind of get an idea just from looking like

124
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.690
okay, like I'm seeing a lot of purple and
yellow that's what's going on here.

125
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.240
So there's like a a big rendering block
at the beginning which makes sense.

126
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.430
You got to run to the page and then
there's like this big scripting block that

127
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.880
basically continues for
most of the rest of the time.

128
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.400
So you can just like,
by knowing the colors,

129
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.120
you can start to just get an idea of like,
well, is my app doing?

130
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.116
Is it like a ton of loading,
a ton of JavaScript, a ton of memory,

131
00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.218
all that kind of stuff.

132
00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:34.329
And this summary is just like
a nice little pie chart of like,

133
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.770
it looks like I spent most
of my time scripting.

134
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.958
Okay, so I know there's a lot here.

135
00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:45.669
Let's start kinda taking a look up here,
so that this, even though it's just one

136
00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:50.263
column, there's actually three sections
which you can see on the right side.

137
00:07:50.263 --> 00:07:53.101
So there's again a little
mini Network tab,

138
00:07:53.101 --> 00:07:55.800
which you can see a little mini waterfall.

139
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.267
Let me make this bigger.

140
00:07:57.267 --> 00:07:59.867
You can see there's a little
mini waterfall over here but

141
00:07:59.867 --> 00:08:03.018
we've kind of looked we've kind of
done the network thing already.

142
00:08:03.018 --> 00:08:06.930
Then there's CPU usage which is what the
summary is like what we're spending our

143
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:07.571
time doing.

144
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:11.715
So we can see that rendering JavaScript
are taking a lot of the time and

145
00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:15.373
then there's the third section
which is frames per second.

146
00:08:15.373 --> 00:08:21.740
So I think I've got in here,
I'm gonna move forward just for a second.

147
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.530
Okay, so frames per second is
a really crucial concept and

148
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:26.600
it's a little bit confusing.

149
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.300
So a lot of talks will speak about 60
frames per second as being silky smooth.

150
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.100
Video games should be
60 frames per second.

151
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.780
Website should scroll at
60 frames per second.

152
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.600
So I think before we do too much, it's
important or say where that comes from.

153
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.900
So basic idea is that most screens
refresh 60 times in a second.

154
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.510
And so if you think about like
you're you've got your website and

155
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:54.180
your screen is refreshing 60 times so
whatever 60 times in a second.

156
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.340
You need to have something,
a frame ready to give it.

157
00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.980
The browser needs to be able to give
the screen a frame every one of those

158
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.580
times a second.

159
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.072
So basically,
you have a little less time than that so

160
00:09:08.072 --> 00:09:13.998
60 frames in a second means that you need
to have a frame every 16 milliseconds.

161
00:09:13.998 --> 00:09:16.325
And this isn't something that
you control necessarily.

162
00:09:16.325 --> 00:09:19.717
It's something that you can
overwhelm the browser, and

163
00:09:19.717 --> 00:09:21.986
it will start failing to be able to do.

164
00:09:21.986 --> 00:09:25.654
Does that make sense like you don't
actually control when you give a frame to

165
00:09:25.654 --> 00:09:28.918
the browser, but if you ask it to
do too many things it might fumble,

166
00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:31.010
it might not be able to
deliver a new frame.

167
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.690
The tricky thing is you don't
really get the full 16 milliseconds

168
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.289
because the browser has a bunch
of just stuff that it has

169
00:09:38.289 --> 00:09:41.811
to do like just what browsers are
complicated and there is work to be done.

170
00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:45.981
So really like your work needs to be
completed within 10 milliseconds for

171
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:48.107
each frame that you need to run there.

172
00:09:48.107 --> 00:09:51.798
And when you don't have a frame ready is
when you start, if you've ever seen that

173
00:09:51.798 --> 00:09:55.600
an animation on a website and
it's like really, really choppy.

174
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.350
It's because it's not going fast enough,

175
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.680
it doesn't have a new frame to show
the browser every ten milliseconds or so.

176
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.550
The individual numbers
aren't very important.

177
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:10.110
What's important is that back on this
view over here as the green goes up

178
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:15.390
that's when we're getting into the kind
of the dangerous territory, right?

179
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.870
Like the higher that the this
like the screen goes

180
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.940
the like the less frames per
second we're able to give.

181
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.930
So it's kind of like you know high
is low high is bad basically.

182
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.180
So this looks okay, because the thing
is rendering is unavoidable, right?

183
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.703
If you have a whole website to paint and
there's a bunch of content and

184
00:10:34.703 --> 00:10:38.060
pictures and stuff like that,
there's a lot of rendering work.

185
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.300
There's a lot of painting
work that needs to be done.

186
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.695
But what you wanna watch out for
Is just unnecessary paints and

187
00:10:43.695 --> 00:10:47.283
we're gonna get to some examples
of that but like so for example,

188
00:10:47.283 --> 00:10:51.152
seeing a big bump of green as the page
loads is always gonna be the case.

189
00:10:51.152 --> 00:10:55.062
You always need that but
if you're running like a timeline and

190
00:10:55.062 --> 00:10:57.090
you saw a big bump a green here and

191
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.919
then you saw like huge spikes in green
like all throughout like afterwards.

192
00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:05.735
That might be something to worry about,
why are we repainting?

193
00:11:05.735 --> 00:11:06.462
Sorry, so

194
00:11:06.462 --> 00:11:09.950
we're gonna dive into this stuff a lot
because I know it's really complicated,

195
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:15.020
there's a lot going on but my whole point
is just like starting to understand.

196
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.380
Just being able to eyeball
these sections and

197
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.780
seeing like what information
it's giving you.

198
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.001
So like a dark red means
that it suspects page jank.

199
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:26.915
It suspects a frame was too slow.

200
00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:31.273
And then the green over here will spike
as you're doing a lot of painting as like

201
00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.531
the frames per second is getting lower.

202
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:37.655
Then this next section is just like this
like pyramid a thing of like what is

203
00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:38.529
the CPU doing?

204
00:11:38.529 --> 00:11:39.562
Is it doing a lot of rendering?

205
00:11:39.562 --> 00:11:42.662
Is it doing a lot of JavaScript work?

206
00:11:42.662 --> 00:11:46.327
Then this is a little Network tab just
the same kind of waterfall that we've

207
00:11:46.327 --> 00:11:47.031
been seeing.

208
00:11:47.031 --> 00:11:51.073
And then this is like a pie chart which
just shows you all that information kind

209
00:11:51.073 --> 00:11:53.259
of broken up into what
you spent time doing
