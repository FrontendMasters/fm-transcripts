[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There is one more on here.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: B-U-C-H.

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.164
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: B-U-C-H.

5
00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:08.992
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: B-U-C-H.

6
00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:09.851
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Might be easier if you

7
00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:12.082
look at the-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I can read it

8
00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:18.883
but.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That one.

9
00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:21.342
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That one, all right,

10
00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:23.968
it is still not loaded.

11
00:00:23.968 --> 00:00:28.260
[LAUGH] It is still not loaded.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You have the two

12
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.140
G enabled.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Did I tell you I did that

13
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.914
on Twitter?

14
00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:36.717
I told you I did that on Twitter,
do I have it?

15
00:00:36.717 --> 00:00:40.080
I do, boy, boy, boy, boy.

16
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.030
I seriously, I had this like gyrotech and
I was like it is unreasonable that blah

17
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.510
blah blah blah blah.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

18
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.110
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I can't get that on mine.

19
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: On the highest source of-

20
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.810
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

21
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.860
I didn't have it on 2G I had it on 4G.

22
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.820
So the throttling was
just like a bit worse.

23
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.764
Okay, cool, so
this site's got some cool stuff going

24
00:00:57.764 --> 00:01:02.574
on.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay, so

25
00:01:02.574 --> 00:01:06.670
that was like some serious jenki
happening just I can see just visually.

26
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.040
I think it might be a slider loading but
you'll notice when I load it, it's pink.

27
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.544
It that's what it is it's these cards.

28
00:01:13.544 --> 00:01:18.960
But they should probably be display
hidden until they're placed correctly.

29
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.130
Unless it's intended which it might be,
I'm not sure.

30
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.110
So we can start with an all,
or actually got these here.

31
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.001
So you can see this frame.

32
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:30.739
It might be intended, but

33
00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:34.773
what's unintentional is that
there's a big jenk, right?

34
00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:39.204
So it's like when the cards
get pushed away you can see

35
00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:44.170
everything moves up,
even this text up here is moving.

36
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.660
So that's gonna cause
a really big visual jenk.

37
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.680
So I would work on that.

38
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.260
There's like a million tricks to,
like I said,

39
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.850
you could just,
actually there's like three.

40
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.250
It's like three different
experiences kind of, Yeah, okay so

41
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.562
it's like the page is white, that's fine.

42
00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:01.052
And then a bunch of stuff comes in, good.

43
00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:02.552
There's text to read, all that stuff.

44
00:02:02.552 --> 00:02:04.103
To me and as not a designer,

45
00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:07.345
this is distracting I'm not
sure if it's intentional.

46
00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:11.350
And then boom and it moves,
so that's jarring.

47
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.060
And then boom it moves again.

48
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.170
So all the stuff that we
actually render originally,

49
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.530
I don't know where it goes it goes away.

50
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.695
So you don't even get to experience it.

51
00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:25.790
So, yeah,
that's definitely a big page jenk.

52
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.354
And then let's see after that.

53
00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:32.574
After that we're all good, but,
yeah, this page here with the hand

54
00:02:32.574 --> 00:02:37.340
in the books is like is nothing
like the page that loads here.

55
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.791
Cool, so that's definitely something,
could run an audit.

56
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.095
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I see so these just get,

57
00:02:53.095 --> 00:02:54.844
all this just gets pushed down.

58
00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:58.200
Okay, I see what's going on, so
this kind of experience is coming in.

59
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.626
So again like, Mark was just mentioning
this, but something a lot of people do is,

60
00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:05.280
so if an image is like one
of your focal pieces, but

61
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.341
you know images are slow,
they take a while to download.

62
00:03:08.341 --> 00:03:10.856
First of all speed the image up
as much as possible, optimize it,

63
00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:12.567
[INAUDIBLE] as they
compress all that stuff.

64
00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:16.011
But, second of all reserve
that space on the screen.

65
00:03:16.011 --> 00:03:19.586
You don't want to go from nothing
to a 2000 pixel tall image.

66
00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:22.730
What you'd much rather do is like
put a div even if it's just blank,

67
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.444
that's 2000 pixels tall and fill it in
with the image as the image comes in.

68
00:03:26.444 --> 00:03:29.940
Right, because you don't want
the screen moving around like that.

69
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.630
So you can have any, even that you would
on the image, that's like a height, right?

70
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.521
And so if you put a hight on
the image in a width on the image,

71
00:03:37.521 --> 00:03:40.243
it reserves that space before
the image even comes in.

72
00:03:40.243 --> 00:03:42.494
So that would be like a big win here,

73
00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:45.602
is whatever image this is
just put a height on it.

74
00:03:45.602 --> 00:03:49.320
Similar stuff [INAUDIBLE],
these get pretty good because they're like

75
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.930
the same kind of hints over and
over again.

76
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.797
A good amount of CSS rules.

77
00:03:52.797 --> 00:03:55.400
Although this looks like there's a lot
of stuff going on with this page.

78
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.100
So I wouldn't be surprised
if it moves around.

79
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.090
Here's a big one that's not performances.

80
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.452
Never, you never want this
vertical overflow here.

81
00:04:07.452 --> 00:04:09.330
You just want the whole
page to be view able.

82
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.780
So I'm wondering, yeah,
you just kind of have this.

83
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.170
So yeah, basically what you would want,
this is a little tricky.

84
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.095
It's okay to have a wide site that's
not responsive, right, like this is.

85
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:25.823
But there's some definite design bugs
here where, I mean you can just see,

86
00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:28.630
the picture is responsive,
but the site itself isn't.

87
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.330
And then when it's full screen, at least
for me, I have this horizontal scroll,

88
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.972
and it's even cutting off
a little bit of this menu here.

89
00:04:38.972 --> 00:04:44.273
There's actually a cool,
I don't know if I'll be able to find it,

90
00:04:44.273 --> 00:04:48.188
there's like this code
snippet that I just love.

91
00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:52.370
That's, yeah, finding and
fixing unintended body overflow.

92
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.646
And it's just this little JavaScript
snippet that iterate through each element

93
00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:58.341
in the DOM and sees if any of them
are wider than the document width so

94
00:04:58.341 --> 00:05:00.580
you can see where your troublemakers are.

95
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.660
So you can go into the console here and
just run this little CSS tricks thing and

96
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.080
it'll be like here are your troublemakers.

97
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.680
These are all wider than my view port,,
these are wider than the document.

98
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.600
Cool, so that one's good.

99
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.930
Yeah everything else looks pretty good.

100
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.850
You know the g zip,
the compression all that kind of stuff.

101
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.220
And then and then I would dig in.

102
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.224
Am I still on the right
guy here I think for,

103
00:05:22.224 --> 00:05:25.749
I've audited about four pages at this
point, I'm a little bit confused.

104
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:31.605
But I'll do a timeline recording here,
stop that.

105
00:05:31.605 --> 00:05:33.890
Okay, so yeah this is good.

106
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.710
We don't have a memory leak at all.

107
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.680
Yeah, it's like healthy memory,
the app loads.

108
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.223
It does something.
I'm assuming some of this JS heap

109
00:05:43.223 --> 00:05:47.285
allocation is some fancy effects or
stuff sliding or whatever.

110
00:05:47.285 --> 00:05:49.700
But anyway, and then it stays like really,
really consistent.

111
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.050
So that's great.

112
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.466
So yeah, near the design work, claim
that space right away with the image.

113
00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:59.546
And then fix the horizontal overflow I
think those like the three big ones I'll

114
00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:03.000
do.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: One question related to

115
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.240
fonts back from when you were talking
about it earlier and you might wanna click

116
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.020
the link at some point in the chat, but
the question is, does the new font display

117
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.550
for font face help with swapping fonts?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, I think it does.

118
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.960
I'm a little bit rusty on all the stuff
that you can do to optimize web fonts.

119
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.190
I don't wanna speak on it too much.

120
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.225
I do think, yeah, it's a better API then,

121
00:06:25.225 --> 00:06:30.380
cuz the way that you load a lot of
them with Google fonts or whatever,

122
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.490
it's an actual CSS file in the head,
so blocks render.

123
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.570
Unfortunately I can't
really speak to that.

124
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.180
I do think I've heard it's
supposed to be an improvement, but

125
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.050
I do know in general what you just wanna
avoid is having the text not render until-

126
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.335
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Google fonts now

127
00:06:47.335 --> 00:06:50.560
has an async option which is what-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And so again,

128
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.755
these are all trade-offs though, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

129
00:06:52.755 --> 00:06:53.428
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Because if you

130
00:06:53.428 --> 00:06:56.800
have your font on async it's gonna
be very jarring to the user, right?

131
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.834
It's gonna load an aerial and
then it's gonna,

132
00:06:59.834 --> 00:07:03.103
all the whole page is gonna
move in to your cool font.

133
00:07:03.103 --> 00:07:07.273
Again you can get into
the messier solutions or you can,

134
00:07:07.273 --> 00:07:11.280
whatever fine it is for
the nav bar, lit that jitter.

135
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.842
So they can at least see it right away,
the rest of it may be you

136
00:07:13.842 --> 00:07:16.579
block until [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The ideal solution is

137
00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:20.120
to build your own character set, yeah.

138
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.270
With only the characters
you're using on the page.

139
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.192
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That's true yeah.

140
00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:24.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But, no, you can do it.

141
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.190
You guys are laughing but
you can actually do that.

142
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.320
You can make your own font with only
the characters that you using in

143
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.440
the navigation.

144
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.743
You know which letters you're using-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I did it.

145
00:07:34.743 --> 00:07:37.276
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You can build a tiny font.

146
00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:38.341
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah that's a lot work-

147
00:07:38.341 --> 00:07:40.239
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And load that, it is but.

148
00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:41.472
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, the only thing is,

149
00:07:41.472 --> 00:07:44.230
make sure your fall backs
are as good as possible, right.

150
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:49.061
So, don't do my crazy font or
Sans Serif whatever you have.

151
00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:52.260
Always find what's
the closest web safe font.

152
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.596
And the best fallback that you can
specify, so it gets the closest one.

153
00:07:55.596 --> 00:07:57.247
That helps a lot too.

154
00:07:57.247 --> 00:08:00.914
Cuz I'll see them go from like a sans
serif to a serif that's going to be

155
00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:02.590
a really jarring experience.

156
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.878
Whereas you could find pretty close
web safe one and fall back to that.

157
00:08:06.878 --> 00:08:07.962
Yeah
