[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.451 --> 00:00:10.808
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There is, someone
wants to look at www.skillsilo.com.

3
00:00:10.808 --> 00:00:13.855
&gt;&gt; Jon: Skillsilo.

4
00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:15.040
Is that how you spell those things?

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.891
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That looks like it.

6
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.563
&gt;&gt; Jon: Sweet.

7
00:00:18.563 --> 00:00:20.419
Learn a language 1-on-1 awesome.

8
00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.793
Okay.

9
00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:26.665
So again probably just I kind of do
the same [LAUGH] workflow a lot basically,

10
00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:30.130
I'll just do an initial page audit,
run it on a refresh.

11
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.500
Kind of watch the the repaints a little
bit, although the repaints look good to

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.950
me, again what you're what you're
wanting to watch out for is,

13
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.950
are you repainting areas unnecessarily,
and I don't see that happening.

14
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.850
So we'll go back here.

15
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.980
Seeing a lot of the same stuff this
actually looks remarkably similar.

16
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.840
We've got eight different
JavaScript files coming down so

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.170
that's mere more than can be handled.

18
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.650
Gzip would be good.

19
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.670
So whether you're using Igenex or
Apache enabling Gzip would be great.

20
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.850
These are the kinda same
warnings that we saw.

21
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.210
There's very few unused CSS rules so
that's good.

22
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.560
You do have, you have inline
scripts that are in the head.

23
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.360
Like I said before,
that's sometimes necessary,

24
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.710
like if you're doing stuff
with web components,

25
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.650
if you're doing stuff with Modernizr,
you need that stuff to be in the head.

26
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.230
If you're not doing those things,
put your scripts in the body, so

27
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.800
we can investigate that further.

28
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.650
We can do a network.

29
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.730
Some colors got some interesting colors.

30
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.870
All right, so we'll take first a look at

31
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.840
the refresh, yeah it seems good okay, so

32
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.170
we start immediately,
let me double-click on this, come on.

33
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.870
So we start with this text
which I think is pretty good.

34
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.390
It takes, okay, so here's a problem right,
like it takes a pretty substantial

35
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.960
amount of time,
before the navigation comes in.

36
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.160
And so what's happening here is
we've got this huge image, right?

37
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.490
And the image is placed above,
is place above the,

38
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.080
what I would say some of the important
parts of the navigation, so until this

39
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.710
image is done loading, which is, we'll
take a look at how big it is in a second.

40
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.649
You're not able to click on How it Works,
Courses, Pricing.

41
00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.856
Other than that, it looks really good cuz
I like that you see the text right away,

42
00:02:23.856 --> 00:02:25.094
the button right away is good.

43
00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:30.050
But I would try to get that
navigation mark up coming in before.

44
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.940
Other than that, that stuff looks good.

45
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.760
Might take a look by size just
to try to find that image here.

46
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.885
So like home page second maybe

47
00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:48.040
secondary cover, take a preview.

48
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.444
I don't think that's the one right?

49
00:02:49.444 --> 00:02:54.801
No six and other one,
I'm gonna close this if I can.

50
00:02:59.252 --> 00:03:01.452
&gt;&gt; Jon: It looks like size wise.

51
00:03:03.818 --> 00:03:07.350
&gt;&gt; Jon: Come on,
my computers going real slow.

52
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.480
This is pretty big These
images are all pretty big.

53
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.300
Yeah, losses compression would
probably help a lot here.

54
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.940
I don't have the images, but for
me I'd run them through ImageOptim.

55
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.060
It's just kind of a lot of stuff.

56
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.900
So you can see over here, like,
we've got like, I don't know, two and

57
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.240
a half mg coming down.

58
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.600
That's pretty substantial.

59
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.980
I've definitely seen worse.

60
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.650
But I would check out those images,
both, how big are they in the sense of,

61
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.490
if we click on into the preview
that could actually be shrunken and

62
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.600
then definitely if it can be
lossly compressed I would do that.

63
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.030
Let's take a look at the preview, yeah.

64
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.022
So this is pictures 6000 pixels wide, and

65
00:03:46.022 --> 00:03:49.990
nobody's screen is gonna
be 6000 pixels wide.

66
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.220
So even if you're doing
background cover which you are,

67
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.280
I think I can't member what the current,
there's people, there's blog posts on

68
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.200
what's a good width for a full screen,
website these days or whatever.

69
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.750
But I imagine you could get it
down to 1500 to 2000 pixels,

70
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.580
which would be a ton of savings there, and
then losslessly compress those images.

71
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.430
So yeah.
So move the navigation,

72
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.740
losslessly compress those images, and
shrink them down in size if you can.

73
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.230
Heading over to Timeline.

74
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.269
Do a, I guess a memory capture
while the page is loaded,

75
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.780
I'll scroll around a little bit.

76
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.291
Again, then stop it.

77
00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:32.128
&gt;&gt; Jon: Here we do have some growth.

78
00:04:32.128 --> 00:04:37.180
It's not a ton of memory, like total but
we do have some stuff leaking.

79
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.000
So I would look into the JS
heap it looks like we're

80
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.690
allocating something that's
not getting garbage collected.

81
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.720
We also have quite a bit
of rendering going on.

82
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.030
I'm not totally sure
where that's coming from.

83
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.220
You know what this is?

84
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.500
I think I'm.

85
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.880
Something that I see very
often is when you have these

86
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.050
big images that are blocking some
kind of render, you see this big

87
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.700
gap here where not a lot of work is
getting done, but an image is coming in.

88
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.190
I am I thinking that that's
what's causing it, basically.

89
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.990
Either some JavaScript, I'm not sure how
this image is actually getting loaded.

90
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.555
But in some way like this image is kind
of being problematic only in the sense

91
00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:21.482
that it's getting a high priority and
coming in before other stuff that we need,

92
00:05:21.482 --> 00:05:23.962
letting the refresh timeline load now.

93
00:05:23.962 --> 00:05:27.240
The only reason I want to dig into
the memory ones is because they just take

94
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.895
forever and I'll just be like okay we got
arrays, where the arrays coming from by

95
00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:34.840
both front and masters and the site like
are definitely leaking JS heep memory.

96
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.827
It would be worth clicking through and

97
00:05:37.827 --> 00:05:41.478
figuring out where that
stuff is coming from.

98
00:05:41.478 --> 00:05:46.932
Chrome Canary is freezing on me here,
let me just close out of it.

99
00:05:46.932 --> 00:05:49.082
No, I lost the last page.

100
00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:50.499
Yeah, question?

101
00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:55.045
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Would you on a typical site,
would you do several audits, and

102
00:05:55.045 --> 00:05:59.370
use the device toolbar to do
it in a mobile setting and?

103
00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.910
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah.

104
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.950
Yes I definitely.

105
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.759
Yeah I definitely would.

106
00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.674
I mean, I think the audits are great
especially if you use Page Speed Insights,

107
00:06:06.674 --> 00:06:09.780
it does a desktop and a mobile on it for
you, which is very nice.

108
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.440
It's kind of nice because so

109
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.290
if you can experience performance
problems with no emulation.

110
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.510
That's that's another big
performance problems right so

111
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.900
it's like if you experience
them on your laptop.

112
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.900
They're definitely gonna be there on a
lower device, that being said when you get

113
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.990
your performance you're really happy with
it on your laptop at that point I think

114
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.843
it's worth doing a CPU and
device simulation see kind of how things,

115
00:06:36.843 --> 00:06:39.120
how to experience things
at that at that stage.

116
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.130
So yeah that the pictures
are probably the biggest thing here.

117
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.900
I would say like not only are they
too high up in the mark up.

118
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.810
So they're blocking things but

119
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.880
they're really really big and
you could compress them by a good amount.

120
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.540
Well, cool.

121
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.040
We could do memory staff if we want but

122
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.770
again this could be me up here
fiddling for like 15 minutes.

123
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.660
Do you wanna do any more,
do you wanna call it?

124
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I have a question.

125
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.170
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: One of the recommendations I

126
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.336
found on the site I did was parallel
downloads across host names?

127
00:07:10.336 --> 00:07:12.830
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah, so It's yeah, so

128
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.260
it's it's not five requests
that it can handle at a time.

129
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.679
It's five requests per domain
that it can handle at a time.

130
00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:25.721
So what you'll often see is people
even just do the subdomains.

131
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:29.600
So you'll see www.1.google.com or
something like that right.

132
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.990
So you have a couple choices.

133
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.900
You can host him yourself like all your
static assets with multiple subdomains or

134
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.620
multiple domains or whatever.

135
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.428
If you need to do more cuz if
you can consolidate them that's

136
00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:44.190
probably the easiest win.

137
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.485
The other thing that you can do is if you
can do is if you use any sort of CDN,

138
00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:52.722
now you've got your host name for
some stuff in the CDN for other stuff.

139
00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.540
So yeah, it's five per host not five per-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So

140
00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.680
why are the browsers limiting it to,
by subdomain if they couldn't they

141
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.821
just lift that limit and it would-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,

142
00:08:02.821 --> 00:08:04.879
I don't know why that is.

143
00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.915
It's just like something that I
really dealt with as a reality.

144
00:08:06.915 --> 00:08:08.659
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It seems
like a silly workaround.

145
00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:09.935
&gt;&gt; Jon: It does, yeah, it does.

146
00:08:09.935 --> 00:08:13.826
Especially, it seems to me they could
have something to do with like maybe

147
00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:16.966
worrying about overloading
the servers with a request, so

148
00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:21.676
it's like you've got multiple hosts names
it can assume multiple servers even though

149
00:08:21.676 --> 00:08:23.408
they might all be on one server.

150
00:08:23.408 --> 00:08:28.100
So I wonder if it's just not wanting to
flood the host with unlimited requests and

151
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.820
parallel.

152
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.700
I'm not sure though,
actually I'll look into that.
