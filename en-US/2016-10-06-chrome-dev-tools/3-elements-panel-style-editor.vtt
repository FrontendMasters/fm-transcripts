[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.728 --> 00:00:05.896
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Now they've taken that
high level overview we're gonna start with

3
00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:06.562
our first section.

4
00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:10.260
I've kinda broken these
into three main categories.

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.130
So we're gonna do editing,
how to create and edit files.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.302
Then after that will do debugging,
how to take an app and start debugging it.

7
00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:21.777
And then after that we're gonna spend
a good amount of time on profiling which

8
00:00:21.777 --> 00:00:24.680
includes all the memories,
CPU all that stuff.

9
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.180
So the first one is editing and we're
gonna be sticking in the elements panel

10
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.410
and the sources panel,
those are the two for editing.

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.604
So cool, so we kinda started talking a
little bit about the elements panel here.

12
00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:39.031
We've got this representation of the DOM,

13
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:44.409
how you can see all the different
things you can click through stuff.

14
00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.630
And then by default it's on
the styles tab over here.

15
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.850
So there's a couple of things going on
that are I think worth pointing out.

16
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.260
One is at any time you can double
click into things to edit them.

17
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.009
But if at any time, and we're gonna
do this and some of the exercises,

18
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.261
you need to do a bigger edit
than double clicking allows.

19
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:05.713
Like for example, you can edit
the classes but how would you add an ID,

20
00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:09.390
there's no place to double
click to add an ID.

21
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.445
That's actually not true cuz you can do
a little trick like you can add like ID

22
00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:15.723
equals food, something like that and
it'll be smart enough to figure that out.

23
00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:20.279
But just going forward, you can also right
click on anything and click edit as HTML

24
00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:24.591
and it actually gives you this really
nice, I mean it's not pretty printed.

25
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:28.331
But it gives you like full access to
everything that that element includes

26
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:29.732
forward to change around.

27
00:01:29.732 --> 00:01:34.570
So that one's pretty handy,
let me get out of here.

28
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.080
On the right side you'll see
all of these different things.

29
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.544
There's a couple of cool things you can
do here that are worth pointing out,

30
00:01:43.544 --> 00:01:45.728
one of them is adding new selectors.

31
00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:50.530
So if you're building a site on here, you
can click this plus for a new style rule.

32
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.020
And then you can go ahead and change the
actual selector, so you could select HTML.

33
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.470
And then you could do background blue or
something like that.

34
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.090
I'm not sure why that's not working,
body background blue.

35
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.720
So that looks terrible,
but you can actually

36
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.010
do more than just editing the current
selectors, you can add new ones.

37
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.237
You can simulate effects
like hovering over here.

38
00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:15.150
So this is another thing that looks
dramatically different from Chrome Stable.

39
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.240
Chrome Stable has like
a little thumb tack logo.

40
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.410
Whereas in Canary,
you've got this hovering tool.

41
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.340
So you can simulate active,
focus, hover, and visited state,

42
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.190
which is really helpful.

43
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.630
I've often seen people trying to
work on some design things, so

44
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.550
they're actually hovering with their mouse
and then they go and they change the CSS,

45
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.710
something like that.

46
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.750
So what you can do using this neat tool,

47
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.840
so this kind of allows you to interact
with the website a lot easier.

48
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.420
So instead of finding
the element you want and

49
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.265
doing an inspect on it,
you can go ahead and click this.

50
00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.485
And then you can start
browsing the page and

51
00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:52.005
you can see that it highlights
which element you will go into.

52
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.095
So when you click an element in this mode,

53
00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:57.715
it brings you right there in
the DevTools which is pretty useful.

54
00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:01.995
So this is like you click here and you
find the element that you want to edit and

55
00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:06.740
you click on it and it pops open
that element in the elements tab.

56
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.205
So then you could add like a hover
class to it which unfortunately I

57
00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:14.052
don't have a very big hover effect,
so it's not really able to be seen.

58
00:03:14.052 --> 00:03:18.720
But you can add those classes to
anything with with this over here.

59
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.260
Another thing that's really cool,
this happened to me a lot at Twitter.

60
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.840
Because Twitter, you have this timeline
that's infinitely long basically.

61
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.754
And sometimes I'd find an element in
here that was like the problematic one

62
00:03:31.754 --> 00:03:33.790
that I wanted to be looking at.

63
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.370
But I have no idea where it
is in the document, right?

64
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.890
So let's let's kinda set this example up,
like a little bit of a contrived one.

65
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.160
But let's say that I find this thumbnail
here, which is for the timing tab.

66
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.090
But let's say that I'm
scrolled up here and

67
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.950
let's say that the distance is
actually huge between those two.

68
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.262
So if I hover over this element here,
the only kind of assist that I get, and

69
00:03:58.262 --> 00:04:00.737
you can see up here this
tool tip will show.

70
00:04:00.737 --> 00:04:03.753
And tool tip will just give me
an arrow like the element's down or

71
00:04:03.753 --> 00:04:06.569
the element's up or the element's,
that's all it shows you.

72
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.650
So instead of kind of like scrolling and
then checking if it's still down.

73
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.842
They have this really neat thing that
they have where you can right click

74
00:04:13.842 --> 00:04:15.817
on any element and
you can scroll into view.

75
00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:20.371
And it actually moves your view port
around on the page to be centered around

76
00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:21.320
that element.

77
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.660
So this is really great like single
page apps or anything that's,

78
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.229
you might be lost a little bit
trying to find where something is.

79
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.500
Another thing that's cool,
I use this all the time for

80
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.840
debugging, is you can use the H
key to hide and show elements.

81
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.440
So whatever you're focused on you can
just hit H to make it go away and

82
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.650
then H again to show it again.

83
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.390
That's nice for doing design work.

84
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.720
You can get some of the clutter out
of the way something like that.

85
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.470
Computed styles are great, so this app
that I've made is really simple, right?

86
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.254
There's only one style sheet, and
there's not a lot of selectors.

87
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.882
But again you can imagine working on
a big application, like Facebook or

88
00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:02.690
something like that and
you start scrolling over here.

89
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.030
There's probably gonna be like
hundreds of competing selectors.

90
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.620
And sometimes you really just need to
figure out where is this border coming

91
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.152
from or
why is my text blue something like that.

92
00:05:12.152 --> 00:05:15.667
So what you can do is you can go into
these computed styles over here.

93
00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:20.040
And what this panel is it's basically,
after all is said and done,

94
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.104
all the rules are worked out all
of the what trumps what is done,

95
00:05:24.104 --> 00:05:26.820
what styles are applied to this element.

96
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.150
And the first thing it gives you
is this kind of visualization of

97
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.696
the document object model.

98
00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:36.660
So you see how wide and how tall
the element is, how much padding is on it,

99
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.560
how much border is on it and
if any how much margin is on it.

100
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.370
And these are actually the way
that the DOM works right?

101
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.190
So it goes from like
padding out to margin.

102
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.170
And then the second thing it
gives which is really helpful is

103
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.710
just the selectors that
are actively being applied.

104
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.070
So you could see if there was a border and
you're trying to figure out where it was

105
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.060
coming from you could click right here and
see exactly where that's coming from.

106
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.880
So again not super useful here,
but really really useful on a big

107
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.050
production app where you have
a ton of different selectors.
