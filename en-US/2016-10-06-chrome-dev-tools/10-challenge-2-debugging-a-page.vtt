2
00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:07.040
&gt;&gt; Jon: So the next exercise here
might be a little bit tricksy.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.946
I guess the hint that I would give is,

4
00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:13.252
remember if you're not comfortable with
the code, you can always set a break point

5
00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:16.841
via the elements panel where you
see hay what's changing this area?

6
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.885
So basically, I have this thing where
I wanna like enter my username.

7
00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:23.080
And I'd like to get a list
of all my repositories.

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.840
But instead I'm seeing,
we're having a problem.

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.520
So there's a couple of
things that are wrong here.

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.880
I thought it would just
be a good chance to find

11
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.000
what JavaScript file is being called, add
a breakpoint there, see what's going on.

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.290
And watch some things,

13
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.170
like if you're doing an Ajax request
is it in the success function or not?

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.400
If so what's in that you know data
like all that kind of stuff and

15
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.410
just kind of get comfortable
stepping through all that.

16
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.740
So I guess we'll take another,
fifteen minutes, something like that.

17
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.640
Question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah one

18
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.860
quick question before we break.

19
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.100
From Richie, is the only way
to Blackbox a script to select

20
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.210
the file in the source and
then right click and

21
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.700
select Blackbox script?
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'm not

22
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.630
sure if you can Blackbox them.

23
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.390
We can check it out.

24
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.040
Yes, it looks like that is
the only way to Blackbox it.

25
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.970
I don't seem to be able to do
it from the sources panel.

26
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.115
But it's cool, so
basically the only real use for

27
00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:28.780
Blackboxing is to get it out of the color
traces and a never step and do it again.

28
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.550
So basically, if you're ever working out
anything and you step into some file you

29
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.700
don't want to be in, it will be
there in the in the call stack so

30
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.660
you can right click and Blackbox it, but
I think that is the only way to do it.
