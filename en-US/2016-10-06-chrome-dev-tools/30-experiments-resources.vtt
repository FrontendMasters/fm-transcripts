[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:07.280
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: [COUGH] One last things I
just wanted to talk about are experiments.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.060
And it's kind of a weird relationship
some of the stuff that's in Canary

4
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.530
are experiments in stable.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.190
But then Canary, as we saw with the CPU
throttler has its own experiments.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.710
So it's kind of, the experiments
are basically they just give you like

7
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.070
a warning this might crash your browser.

8
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.270
There's no certainty that
it's gonna keep working.

9
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.860
So the first thing that you'll want
to do is you'll want to go to,

10
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.670
I think it's chrome://flags.

11
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.240
And this gives you this huge list here.

12
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.320
There's a lot of stuff in here.

13
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.370
I wouldn't recommend just clicking a lot
of stuff in here but if you search to

14
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.060
a file find for devtools, you will
find this Developer Tools experiments.

15
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.180
This is the I think the only
one that I have enabled.

16
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.715
So you go to chrome://flags search for
Developer Tools or devtools and

17
00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:54.140
enable that.

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.410
After doing so
you have to restart your browser.

19
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.180
So once you restart your browser from
now on, when you go to these three dots

20
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.090
here and Settings you'll have a new
panel over here which is Experiments.

21
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.380
There's some cool stuff here basically
a lot of it just kind of covers

22
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.800
settings for
the stuff that we've covered today.

23
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.020
So if you wanna have like folder excludes
for your work spaces as you're adding them

24
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.090
don't have the whole get directory, don't
have the whole load modules directory.

25
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.380
You have a list of all
your black box scripts.

26
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.430
You can have things black boxed globally
if you wanted to never show me jQuery.

27
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.035
That's jQuery's fine.

28
00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:31.390
By experiments is the one we just added.

29
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.960
And they have a bunch of
really cool stuff on here.

30
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.910
And this also helps you get a really
good idea of what's coming next,

31
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.640
what's going to make its way into stable.

32
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.790
So for those that were asking before, this
is where you can turn on CPU throttling

33
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.590
and it'll show up in your timeline view.

34
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.550
Accessibility inspection is really great.

35
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.940
I do a lot of work and a lot of teaching
around accessibility and it's really nice.

36
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.350
They've come up with some program
magic ways it goes into the audit.

37
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.080
It's a new type of audit
that you can do and

38
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.980
it'll tell you things,
your color contrast isn't good enough for.

39
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.500
People that are visually impaired,
where the buttons aren't big enough or

40
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.630
there's not a labels all sorts
of really good stuff like that.

41
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.800
It's like probably the place that I
would recommend starting with for

42
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.610
accessibility is turn that on and
run an accessibility audit.

43
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.390
And there's some other stuff
that I haven't messed with yet.

44
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.210
There's this whole layers thing.

45
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.010
For a long time, all those cool material
colors were an experiment now they're made

46
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.390
their way into stable.

47
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.060
I was messing with the new
SASS stuff a little bit.

48
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.570
Request blocking is just one where you
can, I guess this would be kind of useful.

49
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.720
You can take a domain, YouTube and
you can block all requests to it.

50
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.440
I guess to kind of,

51
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.560
either to see what your page if it's
down or to see what your performance is

52
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.600
without all of those requests as opposed
to like commenting them out in the code.

53
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.770
So, I could just request block YouTube and
reload that slow page and

54
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.470
see how fast it was with no
YouTube requests going through.

55
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.900
So yeah.
So those are really cool.

56
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.400
They're fun.

57
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.710
Again, there's a big
warning up at the top here.

58
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.400
They require restarts and they might.

59
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.190
They might be dangerous, cool.

60
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.970
And then I guess moving on from here.

61
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.999
There's a lot of stuff.

62
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.480
I think we took a good pass in
the sense that we touched everything

63
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.470
we went through the panels but
there's a lot a lot more cool stuff.

64
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.520
I use Twitter a lot to stand top of the
things a ChroneDevTools and Firefox and

65
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.180
Edge, all have an account on Twitter and

66
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.590
they are really good about announcing
all the cool stuff that they're doing.

67
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.090
And the team seem to work really nicely
together with Firefox just launched this,

68
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.280
they share that content as far as
the Google Chrome people that is money.

69
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.570
If you're not following them already
they're really good follows they step

70
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.070
today and all the cool stuff coming up.

71
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.832
If you're interested in more
the rendering and page jank stuff,

72
00:03:43.832 --> 00:03:48.260
there's this website jankfree.org,
it's just a collection of blog posts and

73
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.820
videos and talks on web animations in
60 frames per second, all that stuff.

74
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.730
And then the official devtool's docs.

75
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.360
They're good,

76
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.700
they're a little bit outdated like
the warning I had at the beginning.

77
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.350
If you're checking the docs, we had
a couple issues earlier where the doc

78
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.650
said one thing and
they've changed it since then but

79
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.760
as far as like the overarching
concepts haven't changed at all.

80
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.080
And then, there's this cool free Audacity
course to browse rendering optimization,

81
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.490
it cover some really cool stuff
again with like page jank and

82
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.060
critical rendering path all
that kind of stuff, cool.

83
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.970
That is it.

84
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.860
This is me.

85
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.040
Also feel free to either follow me or just
bother me, if you have any questions or

86
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.430
feedback or anything like that.
