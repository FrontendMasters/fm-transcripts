2
00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:08.518
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Another thing that's
really neat is being able to set these

3
00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:11.501
breakpoints on the actual document.

4
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:16.263
So basically what you can do, I'm trying
to think of a good example of this is if

5
00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:20.470
you are working on an application that,
I’m trying to think of one.

6
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:31.835
I guess, let me go to somebody's website.

7
00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:35.300
Let me think for example,
if we go to Twitter and

8
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.208
I'm trying to find anything
that's like changing.

9
00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:41.688
But basically what you can do is,
all right here we go.

10
00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:46.035
So we've got this video and if you click
play on the video, it starts playing.

11
00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:50.399
And so let's say this is really handy when
you're on a brand new code base and you

12
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.910
don't necessarily know how the code works
but you know where the bug is visually.

13
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.639
What you're allowed to do is you
can open up the developer tools.

14
00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:01.820
Let me scroll down just a little bit.

15
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.920
You can find the parent element.

16
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.212
So like in this case, it looks like,
I don't know, we've got this Tweet, right.

17
00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:13.489
And then you can right-click on it, and
you've got this break on menu here.

18
00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:18.812
And so it allows you to basically find the
code that does one of these three things,

19
00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:22.518
removes that note if it ever gets removed,
changes any of

20
00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:26.840
the attributes like if you've got
a class changing on something or

21
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.113
modifies anything in it's subtrees or
anything underneath it.

22
00:01:31.113 --> 00:01:32.114
So this is really great.

23
00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:34.295
I’ve had a lot of times you've
got like an image slide or

24
00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:37.415
something like that there's a bug in it
and you're pretty new to the code base.

25
00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:39.428
You’re not sure where
that bug is coming from.

26
00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:42.210
So you can right click
on the container and

27
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.468
you can say get break on sub-tree
modifications when that image changes out.

28
00:01:47.468 --> 00:01:50.710
And what it will do is intellectually
I'm not totally sure if this will work.

29
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.414
Let's let's give it a try.

30
00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:57.969
Maybe on attribute removal.

31
00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.400
I wonder if it's getting play.

32
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.151
Well, I'm gonna come back to the example.

33
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:05.651
But basically what it'll do is it'll pop
you into the sources tab at the line of

34
00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:07.518
JavaScript that's changing that.

35
00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:08.049
Here we go.

36
00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.451
Okay Something changed.

37
00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:11.290
Give it a second.

38
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.399
So basically I think it’s just cuz Twitter
is a really big app is why it's going

39
00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:15.161
a little bit slow.

40
00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:19.655
So basically, you set that break on and
then you let whatever change happen and

41
00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:23.059
it'll pop you into the sources
tab at the exact line that's

42
00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.919
causing whatever the changes.

43
00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.831
And so then what you can do here,
and we'll get into sources more in

44
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:31.122
a little bit, is you can hit Prettyprint
and it'll keep that line number.

45
00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:33.011
Again this is probably
going to take a while,

46
00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:34.662
because it's a huge JavaScript file.

47
00:02:34.662 --> 00:02:35.260
Here we go.

48
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.918
So you can see I don't know,
something's being removed here.

49
00:02:38.918 --> 00:02:41.940
But this is a really cool way to
kind of go from the outside in.

50
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.900
So if you're not familiar
with the code base but

51
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.949
you are familiar with where the bug is
visually, you can set one of those.

52
00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.741
They're called Dom breakpoints and
you can get the change.

53
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:50.660
Does that make sense?

54
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.500
I know,
it was a little bit of a sloppy example.

55
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.075
Okay cool.

56
00:02:56.813 --> 00:03:01.299
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All right, the next thing
which is pretty neat is color formats.

57
00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.730
So, depending on the project
that you're working on,

58
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.020
you might be doing your code
your colors in hex codes.

59
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.529
You might be doing them HSLA, you might
be doing them an RGB anything like that.

60
00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.781
And converting between them can
get kind of annoying sometimes.

61
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:18.838
So what it allows you to
do with the dev tools,

62
00:03:18.838 --> 00:03:21.825
let's go find something that's colored.

63
00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:25.235
I'll find this navigation bar here and

64
00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:30.299
I'll see that it's got this
background of these blues and

65
00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.648
let's say that I need RGB or
something like that.

66
00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:38.080
You can shift click on any color value,
and

67
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.719
it'll transform it between it's HSL,
it's RGB and it's hex code.

68
00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:44.915
That's pretty handy.

69
00:03:46.664 --> 00:03:49.980
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, along with the
color, there's a lot of really cool stuff.

70
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.896
So, you can click on this
little box preview here and

71
00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:56.657
you get a bunch of different things.

72
00:03:56.657 --> 00:03:57.888
There's kind of a lot happening here.

73
00:03:57.888 --> 00:04:00.703
One is a color picker,
which is really nice.

74
00:04:00.703 --> 00:04:02.448
So you could change
the color of something.

75
00:04:02.448 --> 00:04:06.394
So if I go and I find this gradient,
and then I go to the color picker,

76
00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:08.629
I can like move into reds or whatever.

77
00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.716
So this is like an easy way to kind of
visually design right on your site.

78
00:04:12.716 --> 00:04:14.327
Again, here, allows you.

79
00:04:14.327 --> 00:04:17.254
This is like another UI for
changing the format between.

80
00:04:17.254 --> 00:04:18.940
And then this is kind of the big one.

81
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.353
This is new in Canary,
these color palettes.

82
00:04:22.353 --> 00:04:25.623
So what it gives you are basically
three different options.

83
00:04:25.623 --> 00:04:29.404
You can upload a custom color palette,
which can be really, or build one here,

84
00:04:29.404 --> 00:04:33.350
which can be really handy if you have
your brand identity, your colors.

85
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.840
You can let Google parse the page and

86
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.600
give you what it thinks your
color palette should be.

87
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.941
So this is the colors that I
was able to find on the page.

88
00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:43.951
Or if you have no color
palette skills like I do,

89
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:48.109
you can use Google's open source
material design color scheme.

90
00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:51.161
This is basically how it is on my sites
because I don't know how to pick great

91
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:52.429
colors but it's pretty cool.

92
00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:56.488
So it gives you access to all of their for
those that aren't familiar, they released

93
00:04:56.488 --> 00:05:00.168
like this big U-I kit a few years ago
including this material color scheme.

94
00:05:00.168 --> 00:05:03.669
So you can kind of like do all
your designing right in here.

95
00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.592
Also worth noting on these
which is pretty cool,

96
00:05:06.592 --> 00:05:11.367
they have if you hold a long click on any
of them they have like all these different

97
00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:14.455
shades that are all included
in their color panel.

98
00:05:14.455 --> 00:05:17.280
So it's stuff on colors.

99
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.097
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could you,

100
00:05:18.097 --> 00:05:23.511
there's a question on the when you click
on an element it has the dollars zero.

101
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:26.101
I don't know if you can demonstrate that?

102
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:27.217
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,
so that's really great.

103
00:05:27.217 --> 00:05:32.668
So basically, and we'll get into this for
sure when we cover the console tab, but

104
00:05:32.668 --> 00:05:38.198
basically Chrome has added these really
cool ways to interact between elements and

105
00:05:38.198 --> 00:05:38.921
console.

106
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:42.317
So you can imagine, like sometimes
you're looking at, I don't know,

107
00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:44.099
like you're looking at an element and

108
00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.400
you want to kind of take it into
the console and play with it basically.

109
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.826
And so what they allow you to do is, they
allow you to use these like very jQuery

110
00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:53.010
like selectors right
that's like dollar sign.

111
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.488
And so what it allows you to do, okay so

112
00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:59.283
we'll click on an element
like nav class nav bar.

113
00:05:59.283 --> 00:06:03.736
And then I'll go into the console and
then I'll type dollar sign zero and

114
00:06:03.736 --> 00:06:06.512
I'll hit Enter and
you see nav class nav bar.

115
00:06:06.512 --> 00:06:08.269
So you can bring it into
the console that way.

116
00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:12.295
And what's even cooler is they allow
you to keep a history of four the last

117
00:06:12.295 --> 00:06:13.419
clicked elements.

118
00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.667
So from nav navbar,
I'll click on container-fluid and

119
00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.503
I'll go back into the console.

120
00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:24.074
So now $0 is container-fluid,
but now $1 is nav class navbar.

121
00:06:24.074 --> 00:06:28.120
And you get four of them,
five of them, zero through four.

122
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.658
You get five of them, sorry.

123
00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:34.441
Yeah so that's like a pretty cool
thing just for taking elements in.

124
00:06:34.441 --> 00:06:37.142
And it gives you like,
you take the element and

125
00:06:37.142 --> 00:06:40.961
it gives you the entire subtree
that you can click through there.

126
00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:44.624
That adequately answer the question.

127
00:06:44.624 --> 00:06:47.648
It also will see some other
stuff from time to time but

128
00:06:47.648 --> 00:06:52.401
basically these comments, you'll see I'm
a lot when we go into the sources tab.

129
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:57.395
They're just like Google experimenting
with UI's to try to help you with stuff

130
00:06:57.395 --> 00:06:59.270
you can do with it basically.

131
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.433
So in the sources tab,

132
00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:04.613
we'll start seeing comments that are like
what global variables are declared.

133
00:07:04.613 --> 00:07:08.260
You'll see a little comment that's like
remember foo is set to bar right now,

134
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.153
things like that.

135
00:07:09.153 --> 00:07:11.321
So those are these comments over here.

136
00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:13.070
CSS specificity.

137
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.451
This isn't really Dev Tools related but
I just wanted to bring it out.

138
00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:19.666
So I usually get questions on items
that are crossed out over here in

139
00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:20.729
the styles tab.

140
00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:25.597
So for those that aren't familiar with CSS
specificity, basically it's like the what

141
00:07:25.597 --> 00:07:28.571
the CSS rendering engine
uses to resolve conflicts.

142
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:33.170
So if you have like a body,
all text should be colored blue.

143
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.107
But then you have like anchor tags texture
be colored yellow, something like that.

144
00:07:37.107 --> 00:07:39.879
How does it resolve should be blue,
should be yellow?

145
00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:44.172
And more importantly, if you have like
an element that has a class and an ID and

146
00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.896
those conflict,
how do you solve that dispute?

147
00:07:46.896 --> 00:07:49.642
So the crossed out means
it lost the dispute and

148
00:07:49.642 --> 00:07:53.458
it is not an applied style which
is where it can get really messy.

149
00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:57.459
Because I give you using a CSS framework
like I am with bootstrap it's gonna have

150
00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:01.402
all of its selectors that it's applying
that I'm going to override slowly but

151
00:08:01.402 --> 00:08:02.972
surely as I customize my site.

152
00:08:02.972 --> 00:08:05.306
So you'll see a bunch of crossed
out stuff all over the place.

153
00:08:05.306 --> 00:08:08.832
That’s where the computed styles comes in
really handy cuz you only see the ones

154
00:08:08.832 --> 00:08:10.158
that are actually applying.

155
00:08:10.158 --> 00:08:12.697
And just a quick if anybody didn't know,

156
00:08:12.697 --> 00:08:16.192
this is like the order that
things go in for specificity.

157
00:08:16.192 --> 00:08:20.221
So if you ever dealing with something
crossed out you don't want it, the least

158
00:08:20.221 --> 00:08:24.327
specific thing you can do is specify an
element like anchors or buttons or divs.

159
00:08:24.327 --> 00:08:26.328
And then you can go into class selectors.

160
00:08:26.328 --> 00:08:30.369
Those are trumped by ID selectors and
then all the way to direct inline styles.

161
00:08:30.369 --> 00:08:34.113
So if you have like divs
