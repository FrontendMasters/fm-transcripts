[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:07.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Back on the in
the console door the animations tab?

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.460
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: Yeah.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How do you get animations
to start recording or listening?

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.305
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: So if you have,
so basically, let me get my canary.

6
00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:19.825
Yeah, basically this is a new one too.

7
00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:23.915
It should be just by default when
you go to it starting a record,

8
00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:28.725
but it's not recording necessarily it's
listening for animation events to fire.

9
00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.115
So if you go to that.

10
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.710
And then if you need to refresh your page,
if the animation fires at the unload, but

11
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.220
either way, just going to the tab
starts the listener for it.

12
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then from the previous
section on the profiles panel,

13
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.049
is it possible to exclude source
patterns from the profiles panel?

14
00:00:50.252 --> 00:00:52.630
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: Not that I
know of like black boxing.

15
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.870
No, I don't think it is.

16
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.260
Yeah, I don't think it is.

17
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.900
The file find is what I always use just
searching for, searching for that so.

18
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.705
Cool.

19
00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:06.560
So, we did koalas.

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.849
Okay the last thing, this is one of my
least favorite APIs in the whole world

21
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.910
is the will change AP- to CSS and

22
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.790
I think it should be renamed so
we'll change question mark.

23
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.110
That's because you don't actually control
anything it's like asking the browser to

24
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.260
maybe consider passing something some work
to the GPU that's basically what it does.

25
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.910
So you're like hey, I have a fixed
position thing, like that ad that we saw.

26
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.290
Hey browser, this is fixed position and
it's gonna animate or

27
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.220
it's gonna render a lot.

28
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.180
I'd love it if you would consider
tossing this work to the GPU for me.

29
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.760
And that's what you,
you throw that request over the wall and

30
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.180
hope that something happens.

31
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.320
Also, if you do too many of them

32
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.430
it just kind of chews on its own which
ones it obeys and which ones it doesn't.

33
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.451
But there's no set rule,
it's all about if the browsers busier not

34
00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:06.928
how much GPU you have allocated, but
when it works it's kind of magical.

35
00:02:06.928 --> 00:02:11.137
So yes, we've got this paint flashing
thing and like what we did before, right,

36
00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:14.736
was just getting rid of stuff which
obviously is not again not viable,

37
00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:17.000
although sometimes I wish it was.

38
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.690
So we can do this thing where we
like grab the problem areas that

39
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.785
are junking cuz they're taking up
too much CPU and we can say will

40
00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:34.950
change transform and voila,
the GPU happens to handle it.

41
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.920
No more paint thrashing there.

42
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.040
So we can do the same thing.

43
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.530
We can go to the add, if we're lucky and
we grab the whole container

44
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.100
that's got the position fixed and
again we say we'll change, transform

45
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.180
and boom, no more green,
no more jank, no more rendering.

46
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.230
I wish it was that easy all the time.

47
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.860
It's not.

48
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.575
Sometimes you're going to use it and it's
not going to dole out the work correctly.

49
00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:04.854
But sometimes it's awesome.

50
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Having the same
issue where it's not repainting

51
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.580
like your page is working fine.

52
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.150
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: You're not
seeing any paint flashing.

53
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Same thing, yeah.

54
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.240
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: The slack
will repaint occasionally, but

55
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.701
the actual page will not.

56
00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:21.398
Gotcha.
I just did a fresh get pole and

57
00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:23.546
it's got the animation wrapper and
everything.

58
00:03:23.546 --> 00:03:24.073
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Gotcha.

59
00:03:24.073 --> 00:03:29.370
Yeah I'm so, this one's definitely
a little bit more your mileage may vary.

60
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.800
I'm wondering if your, if it's being
tossed to the GPU automatically for you.

61
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.580
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: I'm not sure.

62
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.970
Yeah, cuz, I don't know.

63
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.405
At least on my computer the fixed position
stuff is it's gonna be busy painting

64
00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:44.210
the whole time.

65
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.830
But yeah,
I can try to take a look at it afterwards.

66
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.770
It might just be,
a lot of these are with a will change API.

67
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.320
It does that work for
you sometimes which is where we saw

68
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.440
with the FPS meter up we saw
that the GPU is doing some work.

69
00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.560
So I'm wondering if yours
is being handled that way.

70
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.472
I'm not sure.

71
00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:05.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is there an easy way to
see what's being rendered by the GPU?

72
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.020
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [CROSSTALK]

73
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.611
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: What's that?

74
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.748
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: Back in the timeline
view where we were at before, when you run

75
00:04:15.748 --> 00:04:20.790
the recording here of the JS Profile,
it'll show you in multiple columns.

76
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.340
The busiest one is gonna
be the main thread,

77
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.360
but you can click in,
let me just do a quick recording.

78
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.615
So once the recording's done,
come on, there's like no work.

79
00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:36.430
[LAUGH] Sorry, we'll refresh.

80
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.470
Once the recording's done, you can see
what's being handled on the main thread,

81
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.020
which should be almost everything, then
you can see what's being handed by the GPU

82
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.340
and click into specific functionality.

83
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.740
Again, it's going to be harder, easier
with JavaScript than it is with Paints

84
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.620
because they don't have this one to one
correlation with a piece of script.

85
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So you won't be able to
say it's this element on the page?

86
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.130
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: So
basically not in all cases.

87
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.420
So if we kind of come up here and
minimize this main, and

88
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.200
then I can scroll down to GPU and then I
can kind of start expanding this stuff.

89
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.460
So you can kind of click in here and
then you'll have to go to summary.

90
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.870
It's not gonna be that one remission.

91
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.590
I do know that in one of the experiments
that we'll talk about of the very end,

92
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.090
they have a whole paint
tool coming out which

93
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.950
basically fills that void where you're
able to look at a block of paint and it'll

94
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.800
actually be able to help you visualize
in what area it is that's changing.

95
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.390
It's just doesn't have like a one to one
mapping with a piece of code necessarily

96
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.070
like a lot of different
things can trigger a paint.

97
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.260
So yeah, I would definitely
recommend I guess the take a take

98
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.060
away from there is like enable that
paint flashing on your sights and

99
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.380
see if you're getting
avoidable paint flashing.
