&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, so exercise time.

2
00:00:01.898 --> 00:00:06.494
You are going to take this pen,
here, and this pen is hard-coded.

3
00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:09.226
It has your upcoming destinations.

4
00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:11.187
It has a little SVG here.

5
00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:15.810
It has this h2, and it has some text.

6
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.101
And it's all just hard-coded here.

7
00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:23.338
But in your view instance, you have
all of these locations in an array,

8
00:00:23.338 --> 00:00:26.499
Paris, and an image, and a description.

9
00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:31.890
And what I want you to do
is actually turn this into

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.766
a component using what's in the instance.

11
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:40.797
So rather than writing it out and
hard-coding it, we're gonna make it so

12
00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:45.358
that we can replace that data, and we can
use whatever data is in our instance here.

13
00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:51.701
So it's very similar to the shop demo we
saw earlier, going from this, to this.
