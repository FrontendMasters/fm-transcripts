WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.920
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So,
let's do a little demo walk through.

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.730
Remember, we already had this shop
counter with components and stuff.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.120
So what I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna set up the whole thing for you.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.890
So, I'm gonna go,
I'm in my intro-to-vue thing here.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.230
So I'm gonna say and
I've already run the global

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.760
installation for creating the Vue CLI.

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.244
So I'll say, vue initwebpack-simple,

8
00:00:31.244 --> 00:00:37.955
and then I'll call this
setup-example Workshop.

9
00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:40.720
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And
then it's going to run.

10
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.890
It will ask me if I want that name.

11
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.940
Yes, it will be a Vue project.

12
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.150
I'm the author no.

13
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:55.170
And then I can cd into setup example
workshop and I'm gonna run yarn.

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.200
Now we're gonna wait for yarn to install.

15
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.010
[LAUGH] And it will link dependencies.

16
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.110
Yarn is pretty quick, so
we won't be waiting for too long.

17
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.670
And then it's done.

18
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.550
So now I can run npm run dev.

19
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.380
And the first thing that you're gonna
see is that it creates this local

20
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.490
development for me to work with and
it has a few things in it already.

21
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.770
So it already kind of sets up this
environment, so let's go look at it.

22
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.940
I'm gonna open a new tab, and
open it in a text editor.

23
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.890
So you can see in here what we
have are a few different things.

24
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.470
We said that we were using Webpack,
so we have a Webpack config.

25
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.275
We have an index.html file.

26
00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:42.130
That index.html file is just same normal
index.html that you're usually used to.

27
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.710
And we have this div id app that we've
been using div id app this entire time.

28
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.160
So that should be pretty similar to
something that you're used to as well.

29
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.170
And if we open up the source directory,
we'll see a few files.

30
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.701
We'll see this main.js.

31
00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:01.900
And the main.js brings in Vue and
it brings in app.

32
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.640
From app.Vue which is this file here.

33
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.540
It's importing both of those files.

34
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.430
It's creating a new instance.

35
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.590
Making that relationship
of el to that app.

36
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.400
And then it's going to render.

37
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.340
And then app is really the place
where I start to use vue.

38
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.620
I'm not gonna write a bunch of
vue code in this file at all,

39
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.310
I'm usually gonna keep that pretty clean,
because I'm gonna do other things in it.

40
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.030
I'm gonna create global
things in that file, and

41
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.390
everything else goes into Vue files for
this application.

42
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.740
So here you see all of
the things that are in this Vue.

43
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.510
So we actually have
everything in this Vue file.

44
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.880
We have a template with the div id app.

45
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.280
We have an image source and
that goes into the Assets directory.

46
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.210
That's a relative path to the Assets
directory with that logo.

47
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.550
And you have a bunch of tags here,

48
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.650
we have that export default
that I talked about before.

49
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.940
We have our data and which is here and
we have a bunch of styles that are here.

50
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.720
So if I wanted to bring this Backpack
Shop Counter that you're now masterful at

51
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.450
being able to create.

52
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.450
I could go into this gear where I
have this link tag for the head.

53
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.550
And I'm going to go over
to my index.html file,

54
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.070
and I'm going to put that
also in the head over here.

55
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.380
That's the only time I'm really going
to touch this file is when I need to

56
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.883
add something to the head or
add something to the metatags.

57
00:03:28.883 --> 00:03:34.330
I think this needs to be, it's okay.

58
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.680
So, then we go into our App.vue, and
our App.vue is really this, right?

59
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.080
It's our &lt;div id="app"&gt;, and it's what
has all of these units inside of it.

60
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.906
So, what we're gonna do is we're
gonna bring over this &lt;div id="app"&gt;,

61
00:03:48.906 --> 00:03:53.300
and we're gonna replace this
&lt;div id="app"&gt; with this.

62
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.326
And now we have all of these
brought over into our Vue CLI.

63
00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:02.920
We're also going to go
grab all of the manifest.

64
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.920
We don't have to say el = "App".

65
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.960
This is already, because we're
working within that same template,

66
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.820
vue is going to say I assume you
want that template from there.

67
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.680
So we no longer have to do
vue.component or establish that

68
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.450
there's a relationship there, it already
knows that we're using that template,

69
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.270
whatever is in that file, so
I'm going to go grab all of the data here.

70
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.370
and I'm gonna replace the data here

71
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.930
and that will be cool.

72
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.600
Right now my app is probably erroring
because I don't have the child in it yet,

73
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.370
and I'm already calling the child so,
let's just keep going for now.

74
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.300
I'm gonna add the CSS that we have here.

75
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.060
I'm gonna compile the CSS,
because I didn't use S and

76
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.260
I'm going to have this in here.

77
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.080
You might have noticed that I
have it scoped on the other one.

78
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.850
This is a style tag,
this is just a regular style tag.

79
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.270
So that style tag will concatenate and
build styles for you know,

80
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.440
this will be a global style tag for
the entire application.

81
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.180
I can also import other
style sheets if I want to.

82
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.510
I can add a view CSS loader and

83
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.260
that's like I would, you know, yarn,
add, NPM install view CSS loader and

84
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.890
then I can add import files
into these CSS things as well.

85
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.730
So, cool so, so far we've got our App and
we've got our Main but

86
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.210
we don't have our childs component yet and
when we build up this child's component

87
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.570
the thing that I wanted to do is, I want
it to put in the component's directory.

88
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.470
This App is kind of a special one, this
app is like basic like our the thing that

89
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.030
storing a lot of stuff that's kinda
like our view instance was before.

90
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.130
So I'm gonna create a new file.

91
00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:01.580
I'm gonna use a snippet to create that
template and stuff, as you saw before.

92
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.010
Then I'm going to go into my source file,
and

93
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.510
here I'm gonna create a new
directory that I call components.

94
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.845
I'm gonna create this and I'm gonna call
this childs I have to spell it right,

95
00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:17.580
child.vue.

96
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.068
And now in the component
structure I have the child.vue.

97
00:06:22.068 --> 00:06:25.950
I am going ahead and
grab everything that is inside this child

98
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.080
and bring that over to
where my template is.

99
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.600
Cool, and
then I've got a bunch of things in here,

100
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.930
but I don't need to
bring the template over.

101
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.700
Remember since we said
this is a .vue file,

102
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.020
it's already going to assume
I wanna use the template.

103
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.100
I no longer have to establish
relationships all over the place in there

104
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.310
in two different places and what have you.

105
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.640
So I can just export defaults and

106
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.510
add the data that I need which is here and
that is good.

107
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.070
So the next thing,

108
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.020
the last thing that we have to do here is
actually import this child in to the app

109
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.560
because that app is gonna bring
that child in it's gonna use it.

110
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.950
So I have a SnipIT for
that as well I'm gonna say vimport and

111
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:23.340
this is gonna be a Child,
from components childs.vue and

112
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.400
that SnipITs directory or
that SnipITs repo is in the,

113
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.010
like the link to it is in your repo,
you don't have to use it or

114
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.700
anything but I find it kind of
helpful to keep moving them.

115
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.188
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you have to put that
above the export default you had before?

116
00:07:43.188 --> 00:07:46.881
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah, I'm gonna actually
merge these two, so, yeah, sorry, sorry,

117
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:47.669
sorry, yeah.

118
00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:48.430
You're right, I got it.

119
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.300
Put this here.

120
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.310
I was going to merge those but
I put that in the wrong place.

121
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.890
So, this is the import and
then the export goes here

122
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.890
I don't need [LAUGH] I
don't like putting in.

123
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:07.000
So I've got this and
I've got my components, app new, and

124
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.950
now we can save this and
let's go check it out.

125
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.650
I've made an error somewhere.

126
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.360
Let's go see.

127
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're doing extra-
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah.

128
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.383
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's closing bracket.

129
00:08:33.157 --> 00:08:33.980
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: What else?

130
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.960
New is not defined.

131
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.290
I used new again.

132
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.847
Sorry, I should say child here.

133
00:08:42.235 --> 00:08:44.300
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And there we go.

134
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.030
So now we have all of our
components brought over and we have

135
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.560
each individual component and it still
works the way that the other one did.

136
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.530
And the nice thing about this, again,
is I'm using all of these things

137
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.960
in one file and, even if I wanted
to take out all of this CSS.

138
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.050
I could remove the style
tags if I wanted to.

139
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.300
I don't even need the script tags or
anything.

140
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.650
All of these different
pieces are optional.

141
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.120
Like if I had in this child.vue, I don't
have much going on in the style tag.

142
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.010
I could totally delete that, that's fine.

143
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.600
So, you can use what you need and
not use other things.

144
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.150
It's very, very flexible.

145
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.580
I'm no longer having to establish
relationships between things.

146
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.060
If I'm working within that component I'm
literally working within that component.

147
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.190
I can just focus on that component for
that moment.

148
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.090
And that keeps everything nice and clean.

149
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.290
And eventually you're gonna have
a component's directory with a lot of

150
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:40.960
different components.

151
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.780
You might even nest those
into other directories or

152
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.500
organize it however you want to.

153
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.700
But it's fairly simple to set up,
it didn't take that long for

154
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.690
us to move that over and
have a nice build process.

155
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.589
Now for when we're ready, we're not
gonna go through all of deployment or

156
00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:03.333
anything, but when we are eventually
ready to build for deployment, we

157
00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:08.430
would write npm run build and I want you
to watch this area here as I write that.

158
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.310
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Did you
see that dist folder appear?

159
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:23.485
So remember in that index.html file, we
have a script source is disk build.js and

160
00:10:23.485 --> 00:10:26.645
that is what it's going to end up
using when we actually deploy the app.

161
00:10:26.645 --> 00:10:31.535
So what it did was it minified and
concatenated and brought everything down

162
00:10:31.535 --> 00:10:36.315
to be like really, really tight and
performant so we're making one

163
00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:40.595
http request instead of many across
our site so that's really really nice.

164
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.330
All right so you'll start off with
an app file in your source directory and

165
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.950
a Hello.vue in your components directory
that's really nice, because you can see

166
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:55.430
how you'd set up these files and
how imports and exports will work.

167
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.350
Yeah Mark?

168
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just Jacobs asking for

169
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.939
a little bit of clarity
around the render H, h app?

170
00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:04.030
Each app?

171
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.350
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This is how
Vue is actually rendering

172
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.290
everything into the page.

173
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.290
So there's a little bit of,

174
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.650
this is basically like an arrow
function that's allowing us to,

175
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.110
if you wanted to write functional
components and have them render out.

176
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.370
This is actually the type of mark
up that you'd be using to create

177
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.930
functional components.

178
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:30.350
So it's basically saying to render
all of those things to this HTML and

179
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.920
that's what's establishing a relationship
between that build process.

180
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.300
It's a little bit.

181
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.050
Of magic in that type of render.

182
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.970
So I don't know all of the details
behind what is going on in the render.

183
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.390
But that is basically
what's going on there.

184
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.230
So it's passing the app into that H.

185
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.340
And H is pretty standard for
creating those render components.
