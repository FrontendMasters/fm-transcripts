00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.057
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, so we've got
our method and we've got our computed.

2
00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:05.802
Let's take a look at
our solution over here.

3
00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:10.195
So, what you should have had we
already have our selected posts and

4
00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:12.319
things are already filled out.

5
00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:18.027
Then, in our methods we have ad post.

6
00:00:18.027 --> 00:00:22.570
We're establishing a relationship
in this new object between author,

7
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.492
title and label with this.newAuthor,
this.newTitle, this.newLabel.

8
00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:29.185
You can c an call them
whatever you want to.

9
00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:32.025
Those are things that I like to call them.

10
00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:35.245
We have this top post
which was an empty string.

11
00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:41.345
We have this stop post which was,
sorry, an array, that top array.

12
00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:46.870
And we're pushing this new object that
we created with all of that information

13
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.270
onto that.

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.810
And then emptying out all of those things,
so we're giving them empty strings again.

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.800
And so
that's how we are submitting that post.

16
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.859
If we go look at the post in the HTML,
we have form @submit.prevent.

17
00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.907
Remember I mentioned that we're not
submitting on that button click.

18
00:01:04.907 --> 00:01:07.347
We're submitting on the form itself and

19
00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:12.093
we're preventing it from refreshing
the page with that .prevent modifier.

20
00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:13.512
And we have addPost here,

21
00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:17.133
you could've called that whatever
you want in the methods there.

22
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:21.695
So moving on to the computed value,
we have computed filteredByLabel.

23
00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:25.564
It's very similar to the other filter
that we created, where we have

24
00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:30.315
that regex that's making sure that that
capitalization isn't gonna be a problem.

25
00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:34.042
And then we're returning this.posts,
remember,

26
00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:37.950
that establishes a relationship
with this posts here.

27
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.536
So we have this this.post.filter and then,

28
00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:43.570
we're matching to
the filter that we created.

29
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.210
Then, if we go over to the computed, over

30
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.680
into the HTML, we have this select,
and we have vmodel selected.

31
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.838
So that stays pretty much the same,
and we have a disabled value.

32
00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:05.368
But then what changes here is
instead of going postThroughPost,

33
00:02:05.368 --> 00:02:08.586
we're going postFilteredByLabel or

34
00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:12.416
whatever you decided to
call it in that area.

35
00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:16.680
So that is the same name as
that filteredByLabel, and

36
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.728
it's filteredByLabel here as well.
