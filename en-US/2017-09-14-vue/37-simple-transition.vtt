00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.610
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Simple transition.

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.950
Let's look at NUXT again,

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.090
because I mentioned that we
have the ending part of this.

4
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.220
We've kind of done a bunch of
things in our animation so far.

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.700
We've look at the transition component,
we've look at transitioning,

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.310
just from one value to another.

7
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.390
We've actually made a ball balance and
made a ball roll out.

8
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.710
We've looked at hooking
things up with interaction.

9
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.270
We've looked at class and style bindings.

10
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.890
And now finally, we're gonna do
some page transitions with NUXT.

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.890
NUXT makes it really easy to do that,
because we already have our view

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.770
components, and that's really how we're
routing everything to begin with.

13
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.560
But aside from that, you might think, okay
well, I'm using NUXT and I'm using these

14
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.220
view things, I'm just gonna start wrapping
things in those transition components.

15
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.590
You actually don't have to.

16
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.720
Because NUXT is going to assume you
might wanna do something like that,

17
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.850
so it offers hooks for you right away.

18
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.980
So if we have this like

19
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.460
This is actually what that
nuxt.config looks like right away.

20
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.260
We have customize,
the progress bar color, and

21
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.150
we can change that loading thing
that goes across, that color.

22
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.360
And I'm gonna change it to loading: false,
because I'm not gonna use it,

23
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.660
I'm gonna do something else.

24
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.820
Then, again, we have these you know,
hooks that we can plug into.

25
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.390
It's usually V enter, V enter 2,
V enter active, all of these things.

26
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.410
But Nuxt, right out of the gate,
without us doing anything or

27
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.340
saying anything is going to
give us this thing called Page.

28
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.370
So, we have page interactive,
page leave active, page enter 2,

29
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.270
page, you know, so basically, it's that
transition component Prepended with page,

30
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.850
and so you can immediately start
animating and transitioning the pages.

31
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.840
So I'm gonna plug in a bunch of
animation in those, if I want to,

32
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.340
and then I can have it come from a certain
direction and go to a certain direction,

33
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.010
I think this is probably too much
movement For like an actual page.

34
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.610
You're sliding pages around is
not what you probably want.

35
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.080
But I'm showing bigger emotion here so
that you kind of get the picture.

36
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.780
Cuz if I did something subtle,
it wouldn't really get the point across.

37
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.520
So that's great.

38
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.790
That's so easy.

39
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.620
It's like literary the easiest thing.

40
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.900
You don't even have to do anything in any
of The thing's just somewhere in your CSS,

41
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.560
plug into page enter and page leave to.
