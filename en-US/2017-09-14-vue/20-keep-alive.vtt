00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.256
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay,
let's use Keep-Alive.

2
00:00:02.256 --> 00:00:05.400
Keep-Alive is super, super exciting too.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.030
Because what we can do is we can wrap a
component in Keep-Alive and make sure that

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.240
it retains whatever state it was in as
were switching out those components.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.220
So if we wanted to switch between
different types of components or

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.810
different structures.

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.960
So we saw before that black and

8
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.510
white ,those two components that
we were switching dynamically.

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.010
We can actually use a keep alive and
retain whatever state it was in.

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.790
I'll show you how I would work with that.

11
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.242
If I have something like Frontend Masters

12
00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:44.020
here and I have a different font here, and

13
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.950
we've got a flourish and a phone,
and we reduce the image opacity.

14
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.870
Then we can switch over to a white label
I can say something else like you know,

15
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.390
Tacos are good.

16
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.850
And we can change the font,
we can change the thing behind it.

17
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.840
And if I switch between the black
label and the white label then its

18
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.540
retained the state of that you know
component that we have selected.

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.170
And you can actually see how
the slots are working a bit to here

20
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.530
because we got all of the same inner.

21
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.650
That we're,
that are gonna stay the same in each

22
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.900
thing because we're putting
it in with a slot, but

23
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.400
we're able to kind of switch those out and
retain whatever it was in before.
