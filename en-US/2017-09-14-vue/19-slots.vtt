00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.663
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay,
slots are super exciting.

2
00:00:02.663 --> 00:00:06.887
I think slots are a really, really cool
way to replace content per a thing and

3
00:00:06.887 --> 00:00:08.942
you don't have to pass things down.

4
00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.525
You don't have to use props
to change things with slots,

5
00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:14.924
so they're really really flexible.

6
00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:19.490
So if we have something like our child
area here, and we have this slot.

7
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.880
And then we have this "p" tag.

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.930
It's a very veritable slot machine,
haha, with the terrible dad joke.

9
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.477
We can have this slot
inside of that component.

10
00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:34.980
And then inside the component itself,
we actually have a tag.

11
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.820
This is slot number one.

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.550
And then we have this is slot number two.

13
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.760
I can put in more info too.

14
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.590
So if we look at these things,

15
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.540
these are actually what's gonna
be inserted into our slots.

16
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.760
So we can use slots to populate content.

17
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.290
We have, this is slot number 1,
I am a veritable slot machine, hahaha,

18
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.390
and this is slot number 2
I can put more info into.

19
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.840
So if we look back at this,

20
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.330
we can see we didn't have to pass
things down from child to parent.

21
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.300
We're actually just using
the markup itself to pass things

22
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.960
into the slot as we need.

23
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.500
We can put as much information as we
want inside of one of these slots.

24
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.160
So, we can also have defaults.

25
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.220
I love defaults.

26
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.743
We can have something like,

27
00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.667
I am some default text placed
right inside of our slot.

28
00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:21.532
So that will just stay there and

29
00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:25.700
be the content of that slot until we
decide that we want to replace it.

30
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.054
So you can also have more than one.

31
00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.837
So, let's say you needed a bunch
of different slots for things.

32
00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:32.897
Then you can start naming them.

33
00:01:32.897 --> 00:01:36.901
And I would actually suggest that if
you're ever going to use more than one,

34
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:38.539
you should start naming them.

35
00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.281
What would end up happening, if you had
multiple slots and one of them had a name,

36
00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:43.437
and one of them didn't,

37
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.701
is that anything that was left over
would go into the slot with no name.

38
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:50.641
But it's good to be a little bit
more precise about those things.

39
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:54.230
If you're gonna use more than one slot,
I would say definitely name them.

40
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.557
So here we would do something
like h1 slot is headerinfo.

41
00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:01.570
I will populate the headerinfo slot.

42
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.700
So if we have this slot named header, and

43
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.210
this other slot, then basically anything
else will go into that extra space.

44
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.500
So we have that h1 slot header.

45
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.210
And I will go in the unnamed slot,
and that will output to this.

46
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.675
So we have main, this is the main title,
and p, I will go into the unnamed slot.

47
00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:25.065
So if we want to look at a slots example,
we could look at this wine label maker.

48
00:02:25.065 --> 00:02:28.693
We have,
we can make whatever kind of wine we want.

49
00:02:28.693 --> 00:02:32.871
So we can say Frontend Masters wine here.

50
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:35.671
And I need an S at the end of that.

51
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:39.715
And I'm going to change the font and
I'm going to give it a flourish.

52
00:02:39.715 --> 00:02:42.839
And maybe give it like wood grain or
cards and

53
00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:47.749
then change the image opacity and
change the label placement, etc.

54
00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:52.054
But I can go in between this
black label and this white label,

55
00:02:52.054 --> 00:02:56.531
because what's happening here
is everything inside of here,

56
00:02:56.531 --> 00:03:00.594
this is one big SVG,
everything inside of here is a slot.

57
00:03:00.594 --> 00:03:05.738
So we're replacing all of the content
that's inside of there in the slot.

58
00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:11.591
And we can change out all of the styles
based on that different change.

59
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:18.288
So, if we go look at the code, we have
this component that's called black,

60
00:03:18.288 --> 00:03:22.173
appBlack and it's got a template of black.

61
00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:26.996
And then we've got this div class
of black with a slot inside of it.

62
00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:32.272
And that slot can populate whatever
content we need or want in that place.

63
00:03:32.272 --> 00:03:37.011
When we start working with build tools,
we won't have to do even wrap

64
00:03:37.011 --> 00:03:40.768
that div with a class around
it in order to style it, and

65
00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:45.210
I'll show you why when we work
with those scoped styles.

66
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.776
But, basically we have this
component is selected,

67
00:03:48.776 --> 00:03:54.242
remember we talked about that special is,
and we can say, selected is appBlack,

68
00:03:54.242 --> 00:03:59.631
selected is appWhite based on what people
are clicking, and we're changing out

69
00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:04.654
the label color as well so, let's go
back to the demo itself and open it up.

70
00:04:07.672 --> 00:04:11.663
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And in here,
we've got our components, appblack and

71
00:04:11.663 --> 00:04:16.191
the template is black,
over here we've got this container.

72
00:04:16.191 --> 00:04:22.396
We've got component is selected, and
all of this stuff that's inside of it and

73
00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:26.852
these templates or
these components are really simple.

74
00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:29.391
It's just got appblack, appwhite, and

75
00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:32.592
I can change out the styles
based on what's inside.

76
00:04:32.592 --> 00:04:35.173
So I'm using these components and

77
00:04:35.173 --> 00:04:38.912
switching them out based
on what I've selected.

78
00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:44.262
So you can see how you can dynamically
change all of the content or

79
00:04:44.262 --> 00:04:48.735
change all of the styling
really really easily here.

80
00:04:48.735 --> 00:04:52.408
And that's based off of, you know,
clicking between those two values,

81
00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:53.363
like you saw here.

82
00:04:53.363 --> 00:04:58.527
So if we go back,
here we got the component is selected and

83
00:04:58.527 --> 00:05:05.748
in the button we're saying selected,
is appBlack, or selected is appWhite.

84
00:05:05.748 --> 00:05:10.120
So I'm changing those two components out,
but I'm not changing anything that's

85
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.441
inside of it, cuz that's all
gonna be inserted with the slot.
