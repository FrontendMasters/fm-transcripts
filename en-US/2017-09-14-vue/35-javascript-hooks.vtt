00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.826
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Let's say you're like
me and you like working with JavaScript.

2
00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:10.615
I was just mentioning to someone earlier
I love JavaScript for animation.

3
00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:13.378
JavaScript is really really powerful for
animation.

4
00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:16.167
So what if we wanna use one
of these transition hooks but

5
00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:18.606
we wanna use it with
JavaScript instead of CSS.

6
00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:22.202
We're allowed to because we
can use JavaScript ticks.

7
00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:26.551
So here are all the hooks available to us,
we don't have to use all of these.

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:29.782
It's just like the life cycle hooks,
we don't have to plug in any of them.

9
00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:32.789
We can plug into ones that we want or not.

10
00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:38.193
So these transition hooks are beforeEnter,
enter, afterEnter,

11
00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:43.515
enterCancelled before leave leave
after leave leave cancelled.

12
00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:48.959
It's important to rate
the binding CSS false.

13
00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:53.163
So that's you're letting view know, okay,
we're not gonna be using CSS for this.

14
00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:56.789
If you see anything CSS around
that has to do with these namings,

15
00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.558
ignore them we're using
JavaScript right now.

16
00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:03.228
So that's to avoid any kind of like
race conditions or collisions.

17
00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:06.448
Basically make sure that you're not
naming things the same thing anyway.

18
00:01:06.448 --> 00:01:09.196
But it's possible you're
on a giant code base and

19
00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:12.218
you don't know that there's
a collision happening.

20
00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:17.035
So these are the hooks,
of course we've got that vion or at,

21
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:20.345
and you can name these whatever you want.

22
00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:24.247
I just was naming them things
that made sense to me.

23
00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:28.768
So the most basic example here,
we've got that transition component,

24
00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:31.597
we've got an enter, and we've got a leave.

25
00:01:31.597 --> 00:01:34.338
Those are gonna be the hooks that
we're going to use in order to

26
00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:35.399
create our animation.

27
00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.963
And we're gonna say CSS false,
and we put the element there.

28
00:01:38.963 --> 00:01:41.628
So that's the most basic example.

29
00:01:41.628 --> 00:01:46.294
So we can plug into and inside our
methods because they're basically now

30
00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:48.523
methods that we're going to use.

31
00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:53.256
We're gonna say enter el,
we have access to that element.

32
00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:56.378
So that is always gonna come through,
and then we've got done, as well.

33
00:01:56.378 --> 00:01:58.131
So we've got a let it know when it's done.

34
00:01:58.131 --> 00:02:00.298
Part of the reason we
have to do this is so

35
00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:02.941
that those transition modes can work,
right.

36
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:06.257
We've got those transition modes that
are firing after the other thing is done.

37
00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:08.823
We need to let it know that
the other thing is done.

38
00:02:08.823 --> 00:02:14.286
So we have leaveEl and we've got el and
done and we're passing those in.

39
00:02:14.286 --> 00:02:19.649
So any time we need to use like most
animation libraries need are referenced to

40
00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:25.527
work off of, that where you're gonna use
that el in order to create that reference.

41
00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.030
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So now you actually
know fully how this was done.

42
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.945
First, you knew how
the input part was done,

43
00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:35.335
now you know how all of this was done.

44
00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:40.653
I'm writing in here, it's like hi,

45
00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:46.975
we already had lunch, so no more tacos.

46
00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:51.959
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And I'm gonna write it,
and you probably have guessed that

47
00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.751
I didn't have it into the dom
until I pressed the button.

48
00:02:56.751 --> 00:03:04.147
And then we can use that hook to have it
cascade in and bounce into the location.

49
00:03:04.147 --> 00:03:08.149
The other thing I'm doing is I'm
using a library called GreenSock,

50
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:09.744
which let's me save from.

51
00:03:09.744 --> 00:03:14.663
It's gonna take it from a bunch values and
then bring it to wherever it needs to be.

52
00:03:14.663 --> 00:03:17.812
So I don't need to specifically say
go over here, and go over here, and

53
00:03:17.812 --> 00:03:20.028
go over here,
that wouldn't make a lot of sense.

54
00:03:20.028 --> 00:03:27.907
I'm saying go from all of these different
locations and come to this area.

55
00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:31.742
So this a lot of code, don't worry
we're gonna zoom in to some of it and

56
00:03:31.742 --> 00:03:34.747
then we're gonna look at it
a little bit more closely.

57
00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:38.331
In this before enter,
remember we had a before enter hook,

58
00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:42.433
there might be some values that you
need to apply to your animation.

59
00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:48.453
And in this case, for those letters,
I wanted them to do lots of weird things.

60
00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:52.173
I wanted them to transform in space,
preserve 3D, and

61
00:03:52.173 --> 00:03:56.461
bounce around in this like,
I didn't want them just bouncing.

62
00:03:56.461 --> 00:04:01.597
I wanted them bouncing and spinning and
doing all sorts of crazy things.

63
00:04:01.597 --> 00:04:06.271
So the things that I had to do was using
this thing in green called TweenMax.set,

64
00:04:06.271 --> 00:04:10.262
which basically applies a bunch of
characteristics to the animation

65
00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:11.933
right before it gets going.

66
00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:16.361
I could also do this in CSS, I wouldn't
necessarily need to use it before,

67
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:18.417
enter hook, if I didn't want to.

68
00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:22.364
But sometimes I do it this way because
these properties don't actually do

69
00:04:22.364 --> 00:04:24.282
anything until I start animating.

70
00:04:24.282 --> 00:04:27.973
So it's possible that if I'm sharing
the code base with someone else and

71
00:04:27.973 --> 00:04:31.070
they come along and they're like,
what's all this stuff.

72
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.305
And then they delete these
these properties, and

73
00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:37.628
they're like still looks the same,
we're good.

74
00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:42.863
That's totally possible or me, later
like a year later is like what is that,

75
00:04:42.863 --> 00:04:46.085
I don't know and
removes it and then I'm like,

76
00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:50.133
the ammunition break that's weird,
why did that happen?

77
00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:54.193
So sometimes, keeping them together makes
a lot of sense because you're actually

78
00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.925
saying like,
these are the things I need just for this.

79
00:04:56.925 --> 00:05:00.264
The other thing that's really nice
about it is if I need to adjust it,

80
00:05:00.264 --> 00:05:03.907
I'm not going back and forth from the CSS
to the JavaScript and back again.

81
00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:07.199
I'm just staying directly
with the JavaScript code and

82
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.307
I'm making my small changes here.

83
00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:12.908
I think I started off with
like 600 perspective, and

84
00:05:12.908 --> 00:05:16.290
I was able to slowly adjust
until I got what I wanted.

85
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.175
So then, in the enter, and
then el, I'm passing in that el.,

86
00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:25.975
and I'm doing a for loop, and
I'm splitting the words apart.

87
00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:30.299
And I'm able to say on
the z: access do some

88
00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:34.633
Math.random and use this bouncing ease.

89
00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:39.717
And I'm plotting this along a timeline
that I have created that has labels.

90
00:05:39.717 --> 00:05:42.616
But we're not gonna delve
too far into this library,

91
00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:45.266
that's like very library
specific code there.

92
00:05:45.266 --> 00:05:47.877
So I'm able to create a timeline and

93
00:05:47.877 --> 00:05:52.411
do a lot of calculations on there
that I need for my animation.

94
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:56.884
And we're hanging everything
off of that enter.

95
00:05:56.884 --> 00:06:00.513
So everything kinda plugs into that enter.

96
00:06:00.513 --> 00:06:03.516
So we mentioned this before,
we kinda went over that before.

97
00:06:03.516 --> 00:06:08.464
The other thing that's worth
mentioning is I had done a bunch.

98
00:06:08.464 --> 00:06:12.105
Here are some of the variables that
I was creating to use my animation.

99
00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:17.791
But the most important variable of
all is I'm creating a timeline,

100
00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:21.394
and I'm passing in this onComplete done.

101
00:06:21.394 --> 00:06:24.679
So I've mentioned before that
we need to pass in the el, and

102
00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:26.004
we need to pass in done.

103
00:06:26.004 --> 00:06:31.328
We need to let the animation know when
it's done executing to call done.

104
00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:35.655
But some animation libraries need you
to pass that into a timeline, I think,

105
00:06:35.655 --> 00:06:37.466
anime has something like this.

106
00:06:37.466 --> 00:06:41.111
GreenSock has something like this,
mo.js has something like this.

107
00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:45.591
So in some instances, just writing done
in there is not gonna work because it

108
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:47.771
doesn't execute the code that way.

109
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:50.903
It's going to grab everything
that's on that time line, and

110
00:06:50.903 --> 00:06:54.227
we need to pass it in the way that's
kinda native to that library.

111
00:06:54.227 --> 00:06:57.830
So if you're working with
an external JavaScript library,

112
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.994
a lot of the more sophisticated ones
will offer you some sort of hook for

113
00:07:01.994 --> 00:07:05.829
when it's completed snd that's
where you should put the done.
