&gt;&gt; Sarah: Let's go over the solution
really quickly just in case people got

2
00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:07.892
stuck or weren't so into it,
and wanted to see something.

3
00:00:07.892 --> 00:00:13.637
So if we look at the view instance,
we've got that num1,

4
00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:18.346
0, num2 is 0 and
the name is an empty string.

5
00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:20.582
So let's look at the numbers first.

6
00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:25.142
In the inputs we just had span
tags before were going to use

7
00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:27.242
input V model dot number.

8
00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:30.931
Remember we talked about those modifiers
that we can use to make sure that it is

9
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.740
a number input.

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.652
We're also going to use, I mentioned
semantic mark up, were also gonna use type

11
00:00:36.652 --> 00:00:41.144
number which is just normal each team
out to make sure that it's a number.

12
00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:43.272
Then we have a normal span.

13
00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:46.690
So that's going to be,
this is gonna connect to num1,

14
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.132
which is currently 0,
num2, which is currently 0.

15
00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:56.116
And then we're going to output in our
moustache templates num1 plus num2,

16
00:00:56.116 --> 00:01:00.642
very expensive calculations
we're running here [LAUGH].

17
00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:04.825
And then we have a select, and
on that select, we have a V model and

18
00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:08.190
that attaches to that empty string,
that's name.

19
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.598
And that will allow us to select,

20
00:01:10.598 --> 00:01:14.819
use one of these options that
we get that become selected.

21
00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.704
And then we have a V-if, for the name, so

22
00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:21.920
that's not gonna show up until
we've selected something.

23
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.553
Remember if we have an empty string
it won't be there in the DOM.

24
00:01:25.553 --> 00:01:30.286
And then my favorite kind of tag,
tag, my favorite kind of taco,

25
00:01:30.286 --> 00:01:35.022
I'm thinking HTML and food,
[LAUGH] is my stash template's name and

26
00:01:35.022 --> 00:01:38.700
that will output the thing
that we selected in name.
