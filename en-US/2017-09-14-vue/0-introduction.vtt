00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.540
&gt;&gt; Sarah: Yeah, I wanna take a second to
thank Frontend Masters for having me here.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.170
Like Mark said, I gave a course
here a couple years ago, and

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.200
I've since been doing a lot
of workshops and stuff.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.420
I also saw Mark give
a SVG talk a few years

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.840
before I gave my SVG animation workshop.

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.830
It was super awesome.

7
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.350
Okay, so without further ado,
let's dive into Vue.js.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.040
My name is Sarah Drasner,
this is a photo of me as a child and

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.025
also my relationship with authority.

10
00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:33.310
I'm a consultant,
which does not mean that I'm unemployed.

11
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.470
I work for
companies like Salesforce and IBM and

12
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.750
Microsoft and I feel really grateful
that I get those kinds of opportunities.

13
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.520
If you need to find me on Twitter
to ask questions or anything,

14
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.630
that's my Twitter handle.

15
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.530
So we're all here to learn Vue.js.

16
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.580
Why should we learn Vue.js?

17
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.730
What is all the hype about?

18
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.104
It's kind of blowing up lately and
I think that there are some things that

19
00:00:57.104 --> 00:01:00.608
are really, really cool about this
framework that make it really unique.

20
00:01:00.608 --> 00:01:05.010
And we're gonna kind of dispel
some myths about it as well.

21
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.090
It's very declarative.

22
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.050
I really like that about it.

23
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.920
It's super legible because it's so
declarative.

24
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550
When you are working with it,
as a consultant,

25
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.030
I have to jump into these code bases
that I don't have a lot of context for.

26
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.970
And when I jump in to a Vue project,
I know where things are right away.

27
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.130
I can automatically look at
something like a function, and

28
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.200
know whether it's using methods,
computed value, or a watcher, and

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.020
kind of understand what that might
be doing immediately off the bat.

30
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.310
It's really, really nice to be able
to just jump into a project and

31
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.920
see what you need to see
in order to get working.

32
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.170
It's easy to maintain because it's so
legible.

33
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.140
When you haven't worked on a project for
a little while and

34
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.450
then you come back, you actually
understand where everything might be.

35
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.370
It's nice and self-documenting that way.

36
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.610
It's really powerful.

37
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.750
I think a lot of times when
something is simple and

38
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.800
easy to use, we think that it
doesn't have a lot of horsepower.

39
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.440
That's not true of Vue.

40
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.873
Vue actually is incredibly feature rich,
but it also is simple and

41
00:02:11.873 --> 00:02:16.150
I think that that's a really
dynamic composition.

42
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.740
It's a collection of the best of the best.

43
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.170
You might've just started hearing about it
after you've heard about things like React

44
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.240
and after you've heard
about things like Angular,

45
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.600
because it came after all of those things.

46
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.210
And really what Evan, who's the author
of Vue, did was he took his favorite

47
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.830
parts of all of the frameworks that you
guys have mentioned earlier today and

48
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.960
he kind of took them and
kind of collected them into one place.

49
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.130
Now you'd think something that takes so

50
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.300
many disparate ideas would be
kind of like a mess or something.

51
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.700
But the most amazing part about it is,
he did so in an elegant manner.

52
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.440
You don't feel like it's just a bunch
of jumbly things smashed together.

53
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.620
You actually feel like you just have
this really feature rich ecosystem.

54
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.690
I think that the coolest thing about
the web today is that we are all learning

55
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.590
from each other.

56
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.759
And that when frameworks compete, we kind
of get the best of everything, right?

57
00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.932
Vue borrows from React,
React borrows from Vue, and

58
00:03:14.932 --> 00:03:17.330
then both are better because of that.

59
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.850
So that's really, really nice.

60
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.560
This is one of the biggest
reasons I use Vue.

61
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.410
It gives me what I want when I need it and
then it gets out of my way.

62
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.160
There's a great quote by Kathy Sierra,
she is like a UX expert.

63
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.140
And you might have heard of
the thing don't make me think, but

64
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.900
she says don't make me think
about the wrong thing.

65
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.210
I think that that's a really good phrase
for how I feel when I'm using Vue.

66
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.480
I feel like all of the stuff that I need
obstructed away from me that feels like

67
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.681
I've already done it a million times,

68
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:51.901
why should I have to keep reinventing
the wheel here, is obstructed away.

69
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:56.597
And everything that I need and if I
need to dip down into some of the custom

70
00:03:56.597 --> 00:04:00.410
properties, custom directives,
I can do so.

71
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.300
That's really, really great.

72
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.080
So it's a way to be really productive.

73
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.690
I feel very, very productive in Vue.

74
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.870
I feel like I'm almost constantly
in that great flow state that makes

75
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.260
being a developer so exciting.

76
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.485
Goodness gracious, it's freaking fun.

77
00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:16.778
[LAUGH] I love web development.

78
00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:20.580
I think Vue actually gives me
this resurgence of excitement

79
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.220
of working on the web again and
that is just immeasurable.

80
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.840
I put this in here because I think,
a lot of times,

81
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.020
when we're building out sites, we end up
doing the same things over and over again.

82
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.270
And you even can see a developer over
there implementing the same thing you did

83
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.825
last week.

84
00:04:36.825 --> 00:04:40.230
Vue basically looks at
all of those things,

85
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.630
those kind of common use cases and
keeps you from yak shaving.

86
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.740
It keeps you from having to
reimplement the stuff that

87
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.780
you're probably going to
be doing again and again.

88
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.210
We're not going to talk
about mobile today,

89
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.310
that's not why the iPhone
is on the screen.

90
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.840
The reason the iPhone is
on the screen is because

91
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.160
I get the same feeling using
Vue as I do the iPhone.

92
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.310
The iPhone is a sophisticated
piece of machinery and

93
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.860
I know some of the best engineers
in the world work on it.

94
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.840
But when use it, I don't feel
like I'm being talked down to.

95
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.300
I don't feel like it's getting
in my way of using it.

96
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.180
I feel like I have a lot of strength and
power in that device.

97
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.720
And I still can navigate it very easily,
so

98
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.032
that's a kind of metaphor
that I'm using here.

99
00:05:21.032 --> 00:05:25.860
We're gonna do a quick comparison of
frameworks because people might want some

100
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.130
of that but I'm also gonna link off to
a page that has a ton of resources for

101
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.830
that if you're more
interested in that material.

102
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.970
It has a virtual DOM,

103
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.660
just like React, if you're used
to those kind of core premises.

104
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.160
That's the same kind of idea.

105
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.980
It has reactive components.

106
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.270
Reactivity, we're gonna dive
into in one of the sections and

107
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.650
I'm gonna talk about what
it means to be reactive.

108
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.340
You might have heard this kind of
buzzword in programming lately,

109
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.030
in RXJX, Angular is reactive as well.

110
00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:02.090
But Angular is an MVC view, uses the View
layer only, kind of similar to React.

111
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.330
So it has props and
a redux-like store, similar to React.

112
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.860
And the last part of this
workshop today we're going to

113
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.720
dig into Vuex which is like
the redux counterpart in Vue.

114
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.650
It has conditional rendering and
services similar to Angular.

115
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.830
When we're working on the first
section and the directives if you've

116
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.450
come from an Angular background you're
gonna feel very, very, very much at home.

117
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:32.700
It's inspired by Polymer because it kind
of emphasizes simplicity and performance.

118
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.598
So it has a similar development style.

119
00:06:34.598 --> 00:06:39.386
It's called a progressive framework
because we're working with what you

120
00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:43.946
are writing is like html and styles
in JavaScript composed in tandem and

121
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:48.450
eventually were gonna be working
with them in single file templates.

122
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.080
This does not mean that that's
the only way to work with it.

123
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.630
If you're more comfortable with something
like JSX that is totally available

124
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.610
to you in Vue.

125
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.520
Today we're not gonna be discussing
the way that you would work with

126
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.970
it with JSX because it's
kinda like while in Rome,

127
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.310
we're gonna learn the Vue
way of working with stuff.

128
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.685
But that is definitely available to you so
don't feel like If you come from a React

129
00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:13.430
background you have to divorce yourself
from all of the things that you love.

130
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.560
It has slightly better
performance than React and

131
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.340
has no use of polyfills like Polymer.

132
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.940
So it's an isolated,
less opinionated view then Anguler.

133
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.610
We mentioned this before
because it's not an MVC.

134
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.140
It's just the Vue layer only and

135
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.910
if you need more horsepower you kind of
add things that you need, like React does.
