00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.330
&gt;&gt; Sara Drasner: So okay, Nuxt and
routing, why am I excited about Nuxt,

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.840
why do I use so
many trophy emojis when I talk about Nuxt?

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.609
It has automatic code splitting, so

4
00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.868
there's a lot of stuff that you
don't have to configure with Nuxt.

5
00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:16.924
It offers server-side rendering,

6
00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:20.980
which I think someone in the chat
a little while ago was asking about SEO.

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.150
If you're concerned with SEO, yeah,

8
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.849
Google actually did get better
at dynamically rendered content.

9
00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.730
But if you do server-side rendering,

10
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.070
basically everything is
going to be on the page.

11
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.380
And that actually does help with
SEO in some certain circumstances.

12
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.580
So server-side rendering is also
really fast, it's super fast.

13
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.400
So if you run Lighthouse reports.

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.910
I don't know if you guys have
seen this Chrome extension.

15
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.020
It runs performance metrics
using a thing called Lighthouse.

16
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.555
It's gonna check if your thing is a PWA,
which is a specific kind of thing, but

17
00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:55.329
it also has just general
performance metrics.

18
00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.118
View, view CLI and view in it PWA,
there's even a template to create a PWA,

19
00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:05.830
doesn't even have as good of
scores as Nuxt out of the gate.

20
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.275
I ran test the other day and

21
00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:11.358
Nuxt was way higher, partially
because of the server-side rendering.

22
00:01:11.358 --> 00:01:14.430
I think they even have a Hacker News PWA

23
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.277
thing like a repo where
they did a sample thing.

24
00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:23.010
And that got 100, 100, 100,
99 scores across the board.

25
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.740
So really,
really good performance metrics.

26
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.920
It has a powerful routing system,
and you can use asynchronous data.

27
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.013
Great Lighthouse scores out of the gate.

28
00:01:34.013 --> 00:01:36.420
We can do static file serving if we want.

29
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.910
We can use it for ES6 and
ES7 transpolation.

30
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.420
We're not having to give up
things like Webpack or anything.

31
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.811
We're gonna use Webpack right in Nuxt.

32
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:47.167
Nuxt already comes with that.

33
00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:53.140
Nuxt also comes with things like Vuex,
and we have hot reloading in development.

34
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.957
Here's one part that is not exactly,
I mean, it is accurate.

35
00:01:58.957 --> 00:02:03.519
So it's hot reloading in development, but
because we're doing server-side rendering,

36
00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.850
it takes a little longer to load
when you're working with it.

37
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.008
So sometimes for work flow,
I've been making components in Vue CLI and

38
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.068
bringing them back over to
Nuxt if it takes too long.

39
00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:18.740
That is a total personal preference thing,
and I am sure that as it gets old,

40
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.704
it's a newer thing, so as it gets older
that hot reloading will happen faster and

41
00:02:23.704 --> 00:02:24.295
faster.

42
00:02:24.295 --> 00:02:26.425
But just to let you know that,

43
00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:30.355
that's one caveat that I would mention
about Nuxt and working with it.

44
00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:35.115
We can use pre-processors like SASS,
LESS, Stylus, etc.

45
00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:40.185
And the coolest part is that we can
actually write Vue files to create

46
00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:41.445
our pages and our routing.

47
00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:43.325
And I'll show you what I mean by that.
