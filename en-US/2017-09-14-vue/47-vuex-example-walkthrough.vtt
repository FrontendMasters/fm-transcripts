&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: If we're
gonna look at our like, really,

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.520
really simple, real life example,
we're not using all of the things here.

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.100
But we had seen this example
before with this thing.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.018
The way that I'm managing the state for

5
00:00:14.018 --> 00:00:18.803
all of these different components,
is actually through Vuex.

6
00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:22.130
So I've got a bunch of
different components.

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.046
Everything's inside an SVG, even
the components are pieces of that SVG.

8
00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:29.349
I'm just using a group for
each one of them, so

9
00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.707
I'm gonna load different pieces of that
SVG as I need them inside of there.

10
00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:37.180
So we're going to coordinate
some state with Vuex.

11
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.650
You can see that we're not usually
going to just use all of the things.

12
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.830
We're just gonna use the couple
of things that we need.

13
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.020
So we have import Vue from vue,
import Vuex from vuex.

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.234
In here we have showWeather is false,
because showWeather is just toggling

15
00:00:55.234 --> 00:01:00.618
whether or not we're gonna see the weather
component, whatever it might be.

16
00:01:00.618 --> 00:01:05.435
And so, it starts as false, we start
off with the idea of this template, so

17
00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:08.940
each one of them I'm
thinking of as a template.

18
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.880
So the drizzly template
is like one template,

19
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.740
and then like tornado template
would be like another template.

20
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.980
So template, we start at 0, and
then in the mutations, we're toggling

21
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.090
the state is just like showing
the weather and not showing the weather.

22
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.340
Or we're using update template and we're
basically saying, increase it, increase

23
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.900
it, increase it until it gets to a certain
point, and then have it wrap back around.

24
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.900
I didn't show you that part,
but if I went past the tornado,

25
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.119
it'd go back to the drizzles.

26
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.970
So if we're looking at the way that this
is built, we've got that dialogue that

27
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.620
comes in and kinda shakes around as
it's telling you different things, and

28
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.110
that is going to toggle both that dialogue
and also the component, cuz they're both

29
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.880
coming in at the same time, they're just
in different parts of the application.

30
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.670
So we've got that phone button
that we had pushed, and

31
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.640
on click it's vf showing weather,
so we're gonna,

32
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.140
if it's showing weather or
not showing weather.

33
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.050
We've the phone that like, press me, thing
that's gonna go away if that show weather

34
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.790
is in a different case, we're wrapping,
this group, and all these different

35
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.730
components in a transition group,
because even though unmounted,

36
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.790
I had that transition that had
a bunch of things happening and stuff.

37
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.700
They're all fading in,

38
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.280
and then fading out,
they all share that piece of a transition.

39
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.940
So some of the transition logic is just
fading it in and fading it out and

40
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.220
the rest of it is the thing that
we used the life cycle hook for.

41
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.920
So we're just gonna at leave
is leave drop area CSS false,

42
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.150
and then G if, showWeather, which is
what we were toggling in our state.

43
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.118
And then, the template is 1,
template is 2, template is 3,

44
00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:08.790
and then the else for the tornado.

45
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.212
So we're advancing the state
in our store through that

46
00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:18.420
mutation that we're showing
these different templates.

47
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.660
And then we're saying,

48
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.460
if we have these different templates then
show them depending on where we are at.

49
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.400
So we're advancing and
coordinating with Vuex.

50
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.120
So here's some of the template logic.

51
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.900
We have a computed, we have the template,
return this.store.state.template so,

52
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.820
the template is just basically
going to be a computed value.

53
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.690
I only wanted to update when that
template increments and changes, so

54
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.590
that's gonna be a computed value that
I can just used template as I needed

55
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.470
which I did when I said template equals 1,
template equals 2.

56
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.160
Then we also have these methods,
which are toggling that

57
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.180
is this dot store dot state dot commit,
remember commits, commit that mutation,

58
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.990
and then the mounted had all that
animation logic we looked at earlier
