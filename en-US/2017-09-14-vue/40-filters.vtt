00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.960
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: We got through a lot so
far today.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.070
I know we're just like pummeling
you with information, and

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.670
there's just tons and tons of stuff.

4
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.480
That's also partially why I put so
many resources inside the repo and

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.800
make sure that everything is linked up so
that you can refer to it and

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.520
go back to it later if you need to
access any of those materials and

7
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.470
you missed something, or
you just wanna revisit that subject.

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.970
So we're gonna talk now about filters,
mixins, and custom directives.

9
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.580
These are things that are slightly
more wider spread of Vue.

10
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.060
You could actually be a Vue
application developer for

11
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.820
a while without encountering these or
needing them necessarily, but it's

12
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.530
also one of those, you don't reach for
what you don't know kind of situations.

13
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.910
Because they are really useful.

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.170
But each one of them doesn't
take up an entire course, so

15
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.260
we're gonna go three things that
are not related to each other.

16
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.350
They're just three different
things that are nice and

17
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.670
kind of smaller that you should be
aware of when working with Vue.

18
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.600
I think they're really great.

19
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.420
So we'll talk about filters first.

20
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.260
Filters, despite their name,
are not good for

21
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.820
filtering content like we
did with a computed value.

22
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.480
You know, like,

23
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.540
you have an input where you're writing
something, don't use a filter for that.

24
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.650
Use a computed value for that.

25
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.160
Filters, the first thing
to understand about them

26
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.990
is that they don't alter the data, and
they're not a replacement for methods.

27
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.950
Filters don't transform the data,

28
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.690
they just transform the output
that the user sees.

29
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.140
So it's just for making small tweaks
to the way that something looks

30
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.750
in some sort of layout form,
so I'll give you an example.

31
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.570
Well, actually, first, let's talk about
how we're gonna register a new filter.

32
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.210
So if we're going to
globally create a filter so

33
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.650
that we can use it anywhere,
we would say Vue.filter, and

34
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.028
this would be in our main.js file
right before the Vue instance.

35
00:01:57.028 --> 00:02:01.670
We'd say Vue.filter, filterName,
function(value), and return.

36
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.565
I'll go over what we're going to use this,
like, with demos, in just a second.

37
00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:11.725
We can also register them locally on
the component itself just the way that you

38
00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:16.852
do like methods or computed values and
say, filters, passing the filterName, use

39
00:02:16.852 --> 00:02:22.360
the filterName, and then passing a value,
and in return, you have to return it.

40
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.840
So the way that we use it is like this.

41
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.160
Usually, in these mustache templates,
we're just writing data.

42
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.960
We're writing whatever that is.

43
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.040
We'd create a pipe, and
then we'd say the filter.

44
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.160
So an example of that would be
something like text and capitalize.

45
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.000
So capitalize is an example
of when you'd use a filter.

46
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.840
You're not transforming the data,
you're leaving the data how it is, but

47
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.820
you're just making sure that
everything is formatted correctly,

48
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.710
and everything that shows
up is gonna be capitalized.

49
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.730
I made a really simple tip calculator.

50
00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.680
So we have a customer1total, and that's
some value that came from somewhere.

51
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.730
And we have filters here.

52
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.605
We have tip15, so 15%,
we're passing in the value and

53
00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:11.726
returning the value times .15 toFixed(2).

54
00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:19.070
And then, in our HTML, 15 is going
to be customer1total pipe tip15.

55
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.660
So it would look like that.

56
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.326
So if we look at the demo [INAUDIBLE]
here, we've got a tip calculator,

57
00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:28.420
this is outputting that first one.

58
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.583
And then,
we've got a few different filters.

59
00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:35.364
We've got tip15, tip20,
tip25, it's repetitive.

60
00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:38.780
We'd usually probably use a method and
then bring that into the filter or

61
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.170
something like that, but for the purposes
of demo, we just have a bunch of

62
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.840
filters here that we're using again and
again and we've got customer1total.

63
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.830
So we're not actually changing
anything about that customer total.

64
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.650
We're just changing it a little bit so
that we can output it so

65
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.860
that the user can see
a different view of that.

66
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.040
So it's a little, you know, that's kind
of similar to computed values, but

67
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.860
computed values do something
totally different.

68
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.030
This is just presentational.

69
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.982
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could you use this for
formatting dates and stuff like that?

70
00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.384
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah, absolutely,
that's a perfect example.

71
00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:16.441
Formatting dates, we're gonna do
an exercise later where you make first,

72
00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:21.510
second, third, fourth, you create the,
you know, based on the number.

73
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.853
So we can also chain filters.

74
00:04:24.853 --> 00:04:28.814
So if we have something like this,
this data, we're gonna say,

75
00:04:28.814 --> 00:04:33.278
it's going to say the data, and
then it's gonna be filter A and filter B,

76
00:04:33.278 --> 00:04:38.640
then the first one will be applied first,
and the second one will be applied after.

77
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.770
So that kind of is important when
you get into something like this,

78
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.030
where we've got the original number,
plus5 is 7, times2 is 4, and

79
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.140
then plus5 then times2 is 14,
but times2 plus5 is 9.

80
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.459
So the order of operations
there kind of matters.

81
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.879
You can pass arguments as well,
if you need to.

82
00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:07.001
So we are always gonna pass the value in
because we're gonna change that value,

83
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:11.437
so what will end up happening is,
we'll say filters, filterName,

84
00:05:11.437 --> 00:05:13.824
the value, arg1, and then arg2.

85
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.382
Filter sounds like it would be good.

86
00:05:17.382 --> 00:05:20.030
Like I said before, it would be
good to filter a lot of data, but

87
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.870
filters are re-run on every single update,
so it's better to use computed

88
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.180
properties for logic where you're
filtering down a certain amount of things.

89
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.240
The only thing that's filtering about
filters is the name, [LAUGH] so

90
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.910
don't get confused there.

91
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.340
All right, that's all about filters.

92
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.870
That's it.

93
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.652
That's all we've got.

94
00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:43.190
So if you were just gonna create
a localization site, for instance, and

95
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.450
you needed to change
currency across the site,

96
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.250
you might need to do some calculations
to change that number, and

97
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.640
then also make euro or [INAUDIBLE] prepend
dollar sign, or something like that.

98
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.020
Filters would be really good for that.
