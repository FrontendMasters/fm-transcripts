00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.310
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So if we're planning,

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.670
we might want to see what elements
are similar between pages.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.310
That's a lot of times I'll do
these really dumb quick doodles,

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.020
just to plot things out.

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.626
You don't have to make beautiful
storyboards or anything,

6
00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:18.490
this actually saves me a lot of time.

7
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.372
I draw out the page really quickly,
I say okay,

8
00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:24.050
well that nav is pretty
similar to this nav.

9
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.765
Maybe I just wanna make this one thing
transition in a similar way to that

10
00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:29.718
other thing.

11
00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:32.789
And you can kind of see
what things are kind of

12
00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.455
related between pages very quickly.

13
00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:40.610
The things that need to stay constant
can live outside of the pages.

14
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.358
And then in layouts/default.vue,

15
00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:48.580
I've got all of the navigation elements.

16
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.314
We saw this setup earlier, this is
just review for how Next is set up.

17
00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:57.132
And we can get fancier and do something
like that demo that you saw earlier,

18
00:00:57.132 --> 00:01:00.290
where we've got a lot of things happening.

19
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.297
But one thing you might
notice with this demo is,

20
00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:10.380
actually let's go to the actual demo,
I think it's called next-type.

21
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.094
That now.sh means that I'm
deploying on that ZEIT Now

22
00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:16.360
thing that I mentioned earlier.

23
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.269
I'm not paying for it, you end up
getting that URL that says .now.sh,

24
00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:24.260
it's actually a really great deployment.

25
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.300
If you hit this NEXT UP,

26
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.570
you can see that these mountains or
whatever they are in the background,

27
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.490
and it's a little bit clearer to
see on your own machine probably.

28
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.424
They all have slightly different
transitions, and those words also have

29
00:01:42.424 --> 00:01:47.193
slightly different transitions, they're
not transitioning the same way every time.

30
00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:52.318
Because they looked dumb sharing the same
transition, to be totally honest.

31
00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:57.229
Some of them were longer and having them
fold didn't necessarily work right for

32
00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.897
each one.

33
00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:02.789
So I could plug into different transitions
for each different type of thing.

34
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.039
And all of these kind of circles and

35
00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.454
things that you probably
can't see at the letters,

36
00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:13.580
there's these circles and things,
they all had to come in differently.

37
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.518
So that's really, really useful to have
those different types of page transitions.

38
00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:23.140
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This is a lot of code
that if you're interested in GreenSock,

39
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.672
we could go into, but we're also
really running on low on time, so

40
00:02:25.672 --> 00:02:26.772
I'm not going to go into it.
