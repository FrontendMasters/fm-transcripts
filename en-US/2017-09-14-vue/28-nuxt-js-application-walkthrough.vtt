1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.650
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I'm not going to
go through and refactor something.

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.300
We're gonna look at an existing next
project in the interest of time because

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.900
we're running low on daylight here and
we still have a lot to cover.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.780
So what we would do though,
is you all ready installed

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.860
that's what you would need so
you would say view and next starter,

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.950
my project and
then cd Yarn and npm run dev.

7
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.480
So if we go back to GitHub here,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: In

8
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.736
the intro-to-vue repo you will have this
thing called, we just did set up one,

9
00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:41.219
I just live-coded that for you, but
it also exists inside the repo so

10
00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.730
that if you need to reference it,
it's still there.

11
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.280
And we're gonna look over Setup two.

12
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.390
So, I'm gonna go back
over to my terminal and

13
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.408
I'm gonna quit out of T]this now,
and I'll just clear it.

14
00:00:57.408 --> 00:01:02.530
CD, back one.

15
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.418
Gonna go into setup two and

16
00:01:06.418 --> 00:01:12.598
I'm gonna say NPM run dev.
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And

17
00:01:12.598 --> 00:01:16.183
you can see that it's doing a lot
more stuff it's build it's actually

18
00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:19.790
building all of those things and
we get a different local host server.

19
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.155
Off we go over to here,
we've got that same store and everything.

20
00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:31.795
But in this case, we've got, this is kind
of like the home page and if I click this

21
00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:35.845
cart, I see my cart, and I go back to
the home page, and back to my cart.

22
00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.385
So we've got some few basic things here,

23
00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:41.965
some things that we haven't seen before,
we've got some routing, right?

24
00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:44.535
We're going from one page to another,
this is real routing too,

25
00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:46.515
I'm not just replacing components.

26
00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:51.420
If you look at the that local host and
I go here you'll see \cart.

27
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.010
It's a different page.

28
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.030
You'll also see that I have some links in
here that take us back to the homepage or

29
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.880
take us to a different location.

30
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.179
So let's go and check that out.
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So in our next build

31
00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.100
setup, one thing that you'll notice right
away, is we don't have an index.html file.

32
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.070
That's interesting.

33
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.880
What we have instead is
a nuxt.config.js file.

34
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.840
And that is because we're
server side rendering

35
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.420
we're going to actually allow NUXT
to create our index.html file.

36
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.640
It's gonna build in a different way.

37
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.080
So we still have the normal stuff.

38
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.510
We still have title and
meta tags and links, but

39
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.730
we have to write them slightly
differently for this to work.

40
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.990
There's also like a custom loader
that we're gonna talk about

41
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.820
more in the animation section.

42
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.890
They have like a loader for you.

43
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.200
I'm saying learning false because I don't
want that letter to show up right now,

44
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.660
cuz it's not part of what were doing.

45
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.260
The other thing we have and

46
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.470
this just comes with the next build
we have this pages directory.

47
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.770
And in the pages directory I have a thing
called index and a thing called cad.

48
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.410
So that's interesting.

49
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.110
The index.view file is just a view file.

50
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.780
It's got a template, it's got all of
the normal stuff that we saw earlier and

51
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.650
we were still Supporting
the child component,

52
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.160
we're gonna go into our
component structure,

53
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.860
we still have that child component that
we're importing just like we did before.

54
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.320
But the difference is we took that file
and we put it in our index.view, and so

55
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.110
is gonna know anything in that page's
directory needs to be built out as a page.

56
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.820
So anything, any View file that you put in
that directory will be a separate page and

57
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.490
you'll be able to route to it,
automatically.

58
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.820
And the coolest part, to me, is that
you're still using View everything is,

59
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.720
once you learn that View syntax and how
work with those templates and everything,

60
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.380
it all just works the same way.

61
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.820
You're not doing anything super special or
crazy.

62
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.890
We also have this
component called Main Menu.

63
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.536
In this Main Menu I
have an inline SVG that

64
00:04:02.536 --> 00:04:06.523
I've wrapped in a link called nuxt-link.

65
00:04:06.523 --> 00:04:07.880
In nuxt-link.

66
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.110
That is my header.

67
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.680
That's this thing up here.

68
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.910
So where am I using that?

69
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.990
Let's go find out,

70
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:22.250
in the layouts directory we have
a thing called default dot view,

71
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.620
and that default dot view is a layout that
we're going to allow knucks to use for us.

72
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.610
So in here, whatever is in the pages
directory, whatever we have

73
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.680
inside the pages directory is going to
be inserted Into this next tag here.

74
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.220
So this is a default layout for
every single page.

75
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.030
And so
I can use this main menu as my header.

76
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.550
I could also add a footer.

77
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.920
And it's basically going to understand,
okay,

78
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.860
that is going to stay static
on every single page.

79
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.250
It's always gonna be there
on every single page.

80
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.330
And I'm not gonna do anything crazy here,
I'm going to just render that.

81
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.600
Anything in this next,
will now be the cart of the index file.

82
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.120
Does that make sense to people?

83
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.600
Does that seem pretty clear?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It feels a bit like JSX.

84
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.710
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah, yeah,

85
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.850
I mean a lot of these ideas
are re-circulated and

86
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.240
people borrow from other things that
have worked really well in the past.

87
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.690
Actually React router uses a lot
of like components as routing and

88
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.800
things like that.

89
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.440
I think that's pretty great,
because if you learn things like later

90
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.380
on we're gonna deal with page
transitions which are really cool, and

91
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.310
because we're working with NUXT We can
just write view transitions the way we

92
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.460
write any other animation, and
it's gonna work on these page transitions.

93
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.260
So that's super awesome.

94
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.270
And there's not too much more
to it that we have to explore

95
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.080
in order to get routing working for
our application.

96
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.220
One more thing,
we looked at that nuxt-link,

97
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.400
wait let's go back,
I'm in the wrong thing.

98
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.190
Let's close this out.

99
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.530
We see this nuxt-link, nuxt-link is
basically going to be that routing link,

100
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.440
it's going from page to page.

101
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.260
So that's a special bit of markup.

102
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.140
So we'd say something like,
nuxt-link to and then the directory and

103
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.300
cart, you can see that I've said
nuxt-link exact to, that's because

104
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.220
nuxt will just grab anything in
that directory and point to it.

105
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.476
We have to say that it's exactly
only going to be that index page.

106
00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:36.330
Because /cart would [LAUGH]
fit into that category too, so

107
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.440
we wanna make sure that we're not saying
just anything in that directory is fine

108
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.290
We wanna say exact into that one,
and then we can setup links.

109
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:51.330
We can even do the links in the pages,
like you saw that in the card itself.

110
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.650
We had a nuxt- link exact to.

111
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.830
So if we go back to this,
that just goes back to the home page.

112
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.570
And so,
you can use it inside the pages as well.

113
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.541
It doesn't only have to
be in those headers or

114
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:09.204
anything.
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, so

115
00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:14.383
in the pages we could replace index.vue,
and create this welcome page,

116
00:07:14.383 --> 00:07:20.390
and this next link to product, and create
a product page, and next link to home.

117
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.730
And right out of the gate we would have
this routing setup from one to another.

118
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.160
We did something a little bit more
fancy here but like at the very core,

119
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.250
at the very smallest bit this is all
we need to get routing set up and

120
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.910
it's pretty nice.

121
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.190
So that's that loader
that I was talking about.

122
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.700
I said loader first,

123
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.550
but if you wanted to use a better loader,
you can customize the color and stuff and

124
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.350
it would Zoom across every
time you go from page to page.

125
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.120
And it's pretty awesome,
cuz we're still just using vue files.

126
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.530
If we need to use special style sheets,

127
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.750
we would do something like
this in our head tag as well.

128
00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:00.223
So CSS and go to assets normalize,
or what have you.

129
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.410
Okay.

130
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.740
That is what we just did.

131
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.170
We can go even fancier and we are going
to go even fancier because we could do

132
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.970
something with all of these page
transitions between all of these nuxt

133
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.720
groups and we get all responsive and fun.

134
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.860
We are going to do more about
that in the next section.

135
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:28.660
Here is the repo and
this is the actual site.

136
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.550
You can keep clicking on this.

137
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:36.920
This is routing the application and making
it go from, really what we are doing

138
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:43.220
here we are doing just view files where
we are using transition components.

139
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.580
That you're gonna learn all
about in the next section.

140
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.830
And then you're gonna be able to make
page transitions just like this one.
