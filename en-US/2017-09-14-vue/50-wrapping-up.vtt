00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:04.765
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Further resources, there
are just a ton of new resources out there.

2
00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:07.732
And there are a lot of
really really good ones.

3
00:00:07.732 --> 00:00:11.862
My first favorite, cuz we're talking
about favorites all day long,

4
00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:14.314
the view docs is an incredible resource.

5
00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.170
There's just tons and
tons of information in the view docs.

6
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.080
They are really, really well written,

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.463
they are written like a human being
talking to you which is really nice.

8
00:00:22.463 --> 00:00:25.057
So if you would like further education and

9
00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:29.813
to learn more, they have all sorts of
examples that I didn't go over today.

10
00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:34.616
The vue repo is also really great because
you can kind of keep track of some of

11
00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:37.069
the things that you might care about.

12
00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.622
You can kind of look at some of
the release notes from past releases.

13
00:00:40.622 --> 00:00:43.694
You can see people fighting in
the comment, in the issues,

14
00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:45.791
just like any other repo ever anywhere.

15
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:49.922
We've got the nuxt docs which
are also really well done and

16
00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:52.630
also have examples for people to use.

17
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.605
I think that's actually kind of really,
really helpful especially for

18
00:00:56.605 --> 00:01:00.908
something like routing and server side
rendering is to actually have examples

19
00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:03.463
that you can follow for
particular use cases.

20
00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.297
We got the vuex docs, also really great.

21
00:01:06.297 --> 00:01:11.405
I wrote the css-tricks guide that's
about five articles that goes through

22
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:16.134
vue a lot of the demos are the same,
but some of the information is not.

23
00:01:16.134 --> 00:01:22.813
Awesome vue is a huge repo that's just
full of tons of great vue resources,

24
00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:27.488
it's got podcast,
it's got all of these meta ten.

25
00:01:27.488 --> 00:01:31.889
A lot of the really good few materials
that you're gonna need to know.

26
00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:36.788
I won't even like make a list like
this because this has pretty much

27
00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:41.172
everything you ever need to know
about vue all in one place.

28
00:01:41.172 --> 00:01:44.074
So definitely check, I'm not even at
the bottom of the page by the way.

29
00:01:44.074 --> 00:01:48.266
[LAUGH] There's just tons and
tons of stuff.

30
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.520
There's quite a few Vue newsletters.

31
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.283
There's like four of them or something.

32
00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:56.153
I just linked up one here, but
if you write newsletter, Vue in Twitter,

33
00:01:56.153 --> 00:01:57.808
a bunch of things will come up.

34
00:01:57.808 --> 00:02:00.571
So this is a really good Vue newsletter.

35
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:05.873
The monterail blog, I mentioned that
Damian, the one who put on Vue conf.

36
00:02:05.873 --> 00:02:10.478
Writes a lot about Vue, and so the
Monterail blog actually has just tons of

37
00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:15.304
great articles about Vue, or even just,
how would I create these getters and

38
00:02:15.304 --> 00:02:18.146
setters from scratch
if I wasn't using Vue.

39
00:02:18.146 --> 00:02:19.921
But I wanted to do it like Vue,

40
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:23.475
those kind of mental exercises
that are really fun to read.

41
00:02:23.475 --> 00:02:27.956
There's another thing I think that's
also in this letter called vue tips.

42
00:02:27.956 --> 00:02:32.809
There's also the majesty vue
which is an ebook that you

43
00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.290
can get online that's really great and

44
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.947
has a lot of good exercises for
you to try out as well.

45
00:02:40.947 --> 00:02:46.147
Thank you for coming in here and
lasting the entire day full

46
00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:52.211
of all these material I really
appreciated, thank you for coming.

47
00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:58.767
&gt;&gt; Group: [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Mark

48
00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:03.365
you said you wanna me to
cover like how the view

49
00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:07.226
community kind of and how-
&gt;&gt; Mark: Yeah, just kind of,

50
00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:08.836
I mean there's some question.

51
00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:11.995
It doesn't have to be in
the final videos or the course.

52
00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:12.958
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay.

53
00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.608
&gt;&gt; Mark: Just kind of-
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Just go over the-

54
00:03:14.608 --> 00:03:16.834
&gt;&gt; Mark: Irrespective of the team and

55
00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:17.765
adoption.

56
00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:19.065
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah, totally.

57
00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:22.177
Adoption has kind of gone like this,
especially lately.

58
00:03:22.177 --> 00:03:24.835
You've probably heard some of this.

59
00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:28.419
So recently, it was adopted by Adobe and
then Espresso, and

60
00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.468
a few other kind of big companies.

61
00:03:30.468 --> 00:03:33.104
It's already really well adopted in Asia.

62
00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:38.056
So I don't know if you're familiar with
AliBaba or Weebo, those are like two

63
00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:42.778
of the biggest companies in the world but
we don't really think about them

64
00:03:42.778 --> 00:03:47.523
because we're from the west and
we don't think about the east very much.

65
00:03:47.523 --> 00:03:51.074
So it has really good
adoption in the east.

66
00:03:51.074 --> 00:03:56.771
In the West it's starting to pick up
steam, I think because other frameworks

67
00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:01.605
like Angular is funded by Google and
Facebook is funded by React.

68
00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:04.519
People are looking for
that comparable thing in Vue.

69
00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.790
But Vue is not funded by
a major company in that way.

70
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.830
It has a ton of community support.

71
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.769
Like Laravel and STDLib and
GitLabs and tons and

72
00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.236
tons of people help support Vue.

73
00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:25.798
But it's not backed or
created by a big company.

74
00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:31.255
There are debates on either side of
the issue about what that means.

75
00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:33.184
There are some people who are like,

76
00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:36.699
I'm not gonna do it unless it's
backed by a big company it's a risk.

77
00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.287
There are other who are saying, well you
know if Facebook decides that they need it

78
00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:43.407
for a different direction or
they're going in a different direction,

79
00:04:43.407 --> 00:04:45.399
there's really nothing
you can do about it.

80
00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:49.358
Plus they've got licensing that
basically says that they own you,

81
00:04:49.358 --> 00:04:51.658
if you're using a React application.

82
00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:56.641
I'm exaggerating a bit, but
there's licensing issues

83
00:04:56.641 --> 00:05:00.702
that come along with big
companies owning it.

84
00:05:00.702 --> 00:05:02.026
And they're both right,

85
00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:05.044
both of these sides are things
to take into consideration.

86
00:05:05.044 --> 00:05:10.617
Evan has said that he's not
gonna quit working on it.

87
00:05:10.617 --> 00:05:13.590
It's not just him working on it,
that's the other thing,

88
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.563
is that there's a giant Vue core team.

89
00:05:15.563 --> 00:05:18.063
There's a lot of contributors
from all over the place but

90
00:05:18.063 --> 00:05:19.428
there's also a Vue core team.

91
00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:25.571
So it's not just one guy at his computer
or something like that as well.

92
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.206
So that's a misconception, too.

93
00:05:28.206 --> 00:05:33.237
So I would say community or
adoption among big companies,

94
00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:36.531
it's like we're seeing it trend up.

95
00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:41.758
But this is also, if you compare it to
where React was at this point in its

96
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:47.876
youth or whatever because Vue is still
younger than React, they're comparable.

97
00:05:47.876 --> 00:05:51.219
Those two lines are very much the same.

98
00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.986
I remember even a couple years ago being
at Zillow and we were I don't know,

99
00:05:55.986 --> 00:06:00.603
I don't know if we can adopt React,
it's kind of a risk, everybody uses

100
00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:05.319
Angular looking at Bill with and
there was not enough adoption and stuff.

101
00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.268
And now adaption is pretty ubiquitous for
React.

102
00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:13.437
If that line all of a sudden killed or
something then I would be worried but

103
00:06:13.437 --> 00:06:17.359
I think it's actually just trending and
trending up.

104
00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:24.534
So we'll see, but yeah those are all good
concerns, that's kind of my take on it.
