00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.588
&gt;&gt; Sarah: Cool, so
let's do an exercise really quickly.

2
00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:09.994
Take your component solution or
this pen exactly,

3
00:00:09.994 --> 00:00:14.151
and let me make sure that it's public.

4
00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:22.441
&gt;&gt; Sarah: And set it up with Vue-CLI and
do a real build process.

5
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:25.948
So just refactor this pen
like what I had just done for

6
00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:30.501
you when we were live coding together,
and set this up in Vue-CLI.

7
00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:34.587
If you want to,
you can try to set it up Nuxt instead.

8
00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:38.321
I'm not gonna make you do that
if you don't want to, but

9
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:44.040
if you're extra curious about Nuxt,
you can do something like that in routing.

10
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.193
But for the base exercise,
let's set it up with Vue-CLI,

11
00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:53.150
and I'll give you 15 minutes for that.

12
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.525
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a few questions,

13
00:00:55.525 --> 00:01:00.797
what's the difference between
a Vue PWA template and Nuxt?

14
00:01:00.797 --> 00:01:06.553
&gt;&gt; Sarah: Well, for a Vue PWA template,
they're actually not terribly compatible.

15
00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:09.518
Because like you saw in
that nuxt.config file,

16
00:01:09.518 --> 00:01:13.439
we are actually having to do all
of the server-side rendering.

17
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.955
So that PWA template Is assumptive of
a completely different build process.

18
00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:23.918
So that PWA template is gonna do
a whole bunch of different type of code

19
00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:25.555
splitting and stuff.

20
00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:32.005
So they both have code splitting, but that
nuxt.config versus that index.html file,

21
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:37.000
those are very, very different ways
of setting up the application.

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.448
So both of them are fast, I would say.

23
00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:46.276
And vue init pwa is really nice, but
if you need server-side rendering,

24
00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:51.636
I would go for the Nuxt starter and
work with that instead of the PWA.

25
00:01:51.636 --> 00:01:54.168
They're different build processes,

26
00:01:54.168 --> 00:01:58.931
they're not compatible because of
the way that they're done right now.

27
00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:03.749
I think in the future, Nuxt and the team
that made that progressive web app page

28
00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.164
are gonna work more closely together.

29
00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:11.349
But at this time there is a lot that you
lose going to the PWA that Nuxt has,

30
00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.440
and you'd have to re-setup
all of that configuration.

31
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.967
So it's really not worth,
they're not really the same.

32
00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:23.878
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Then Jacob's saying,
I hear great things about Nuxt,

33
00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:25.490
like what you're saying.

34
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.518
However, at what point
should I try to learn it and

35
00:02:28.518 --> 00:02:31.342
incorporate it in
a project professionally?

36
00:02:31.342 --> 00:02:34.829
&gt;&gt; Sarah: I think we're gonna
kind of address that in the next

37
00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.377
section a little bit.

38
00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:41.626
But I think when you start setting up
an application where you need routing,

39
00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:45.890
you can use Vue Router, and
Vue Router is really great.

40
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.030
I don't use Vue Router, though,
I use Nuxt for my routing.

41
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.557
Because I think that that
server-side rendering in the perf,

42
00:02:54.557 --> 00:02:59.620
it kinda speaks for it, after running
those tests I was really kind of sold.

43
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.537
So I would say when your project
starts developing many pages,

44
00:03:04.537 --> 00:03:08.245
and you really want it to
be as fast as possible,

45
00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:12.630
that's a good time to start
thinking about using Nuxt.

46
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.079
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So when you're showing us
the main menu tag, and right underneath

47
00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.403
there's the nuxt tag Are you saying that
when you transition from page to page,

48
00:03:22.403 --> 00:03:27.884
the only thing that's updated in the DOM
is actually the contents of the nuxt tag,

49
00:03:27.884 --> 00:03:31.168
and the main menu element
actually stays there?

50
00:03:31.168 --> 00:03:33.176
&gt;&gt; Sarah: No, no, no, it's actual routing.

51
00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:38.020
As far as I'm concerned, it is actually
routing from page to page, but

52
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.059
it just keeps it consistent.

53
00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:45.516
And also because it's sever-side rendered,
it's really, really fast for

54
00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:50.656
it to understand that file because
you've already brought it in before.

55
00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:55.426
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So as I understand it,
Nuxt does client-side routing too.

56
00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:58.693
So when you go to a new page, it doesn't
download, doesn't hit the server for

57
00:03:58.693 --> 00:03:59.297
everything.

58
00:03:59.297 --> 00:04:03.098
It just hits the server for
some stuff and does a partial DOM update,

59
00:04:03.098 --> 00:04:04.187
is that-
&gt;&gt; Sarah: Yeah,

60
00:04:04.187 --> 00:04:08.514
I don't know a ton about the internals,
and some stuff is moving because what,

61
00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.366
so I was gonna talk about
this in the animation part.

62
00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:15.291
But Nuxt is incrementing
to a 1.0 version right now,

63
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:18.057
it previously was not quite at 1.0.

64
00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.428
It was waiting for

65
00:04:19.428 --> 00:04:24.920
this Vue release that came out yesterday
in order to be able to release.

66
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.600
So some stuff is updating.

67
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.970
Like there's a bunch of stuff
that's getting fixed and

68
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.287
updating in this new version.

69
00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:38.054
So I think that there's enough moving
parts that what I would do is,

70
00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:43.073
when that 1.0 version lands,
which should be in the next few weeks,

71
00:04:43.073 --> 00:04:45.769
is look at the release notes for that.
