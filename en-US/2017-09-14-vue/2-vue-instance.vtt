00:00:00.297 --> 00:00:00.882
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,

2
00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:04.579
the first thing we're gonna talk about
is directives and data rendering.

3
00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:09.429
If you come from an Angular background, a
lot of this stuff will be review for you.

4
00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.202
And especially if you've worked with some
of the previous frameworks that people

5
00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:17.868
were talking about earlier today,
a lot of this stuff will look

6
00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:21.831
familiar to you because Vue borrows
from a lot of those other areas.

7
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:26.812
But the directives are super powerful and
so we gonna start there and we're also

8
00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:31.885
gonna talk a little bit about Mustache
template and using data in a Vue Instance.

9
00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:36.352
So just in case somebody skipped over
the introduction because I skipped

10
00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:40.377
the introduction sometimes here
is the [LAUGH] GitHub Repo again,

11
00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:43.173
the Vue DevTool and
the Codepen collection.

12
00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:46.862
All right, let's do an intro and
the Vue Instance.

13
00:00:46.862 --> 00:00:51.186
We're gonna do a much longer deep dive
into the Vue Instance a little bit

14
00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:51.842
later on.

15
00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:56.335
But for now, what I'd love for
you to see here is that,

16
00:00:56.335 --> 00:01:01.240
in order to create this pen,
what we have here is div id app.

17
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.878
And then we have mustache templates
that say text, nice to meet Vue.

18
00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:09.643
And then we've got in
our JavaScript tab here,

19
00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:13.501
new Vue and
the element that we're using is app,

20
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:18.134
which establishes a relationship
with this div id = app.

21
00:01:18.134 --> 00:01:21.899
You can call that whatever you want,

22
00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.516
like I could call it like robotface here,
and

23
00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:32.120
then robotface over here,
and that would still work.

24
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.480
All the styling fell off of it,
but you kinda get the picture.

25
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.741
Then, we have this data object.

26
00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:43.557
That data object is what we're using in
the Vue Instance to manage the state of

27
00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:44.752
the application.

28
00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:47.034
So things that we need to adjust,

29
00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:51.848
part of the reactivity system which
we're gonna delve into later on.

30
00:01:51.848 --> 00:01:58.505
But really all you need to know for now is
that this text establishes a relationship

31
00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:03.523
in the HTML outputted through
this mustache template tags and

32
00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:07.596
that string will then be
outputted there as well.

33
00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:11.484
So it establishes a relationship
between this mustache tags and

34
00:02:11.484 --> 00:02:16.023
that hello world and that's really all
you need in order to, To get going.

35
00:02:16.023 --> 00:02:20.794
If you wanted to just use Vue in
an HTML application, you could.

36
00:02:20.794 --> 00:02:24.143
You have a lot of strength when
you use a whole build process.

37
00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:28.368
But for the first part of this, I'm gonna
show you how we're gonna use it in HTML,

38
00:02:28.368 --> 00:02:31.138
CSS, and
JavaScript without doing a build process.

39
00:02:31.138 --> 00:02:36.111
Because sometimes you wanna incrementally
adopt the framework before you like sell

40
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:37.449
yourself on the farm.

41
00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:38.668
And, yes, go ahead.

42
00:02:38.668 --> 00:02:41.973
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just a quick question
where you're assigning the element,

43
00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:44.640
I'm assuming that can be
any CSS type selector?

44
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.971
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yes, it can, absolutely.

45
00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:49.729
I typically use IDs because you
only want one instance of that but

46
00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.685
it can be anything that you like.

47
00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:54.961
So sometimes we incrementally
adopt frameworks,

48
00:02:54.961 --> 00:03:00.380
especially because not many of us are just
starting a website from scratch, right?

49
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.823
So if you need to do that,
you can do that with Vue.

50
00:03:03.823 --> 00:03:06.821
One more thing I wanted to
show you in this example.

51
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:13.081
So if we have this Hello World and
I opened it in the debug window.

52
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:15.996
I can go over to my Vue Inspector, and

53
00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:20.240
then click on this Root, and
see that text over here.

54
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.200
So if I'm looking at it in
the Vue DevTools, what I will see,

55
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.175
instead of seeing all of
the elements like you see over here.

56
00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:32.314
That's like all of that outputted
elements and bill elements for the page.

57
00:03:32.314 --> 00:03:36.297
We have in the Vue DevTools
exactly what's going on, so

58
00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:41.736
that root is that Vue Instance itself and
we see that text in the Hello World.

59
00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:43.955
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This is so cool.
