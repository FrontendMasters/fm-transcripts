&gt;&gt; Sarah: Here is where you would
start from and here is this and

2
00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:11.010
then in the solution we have filters.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.210
I am just using switch statements
to decide whether it goes to first,

4
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.350
second, third and most of them are this
default of [SOUND] [LAUGH] and

5
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.550
that is what gets outputted there,
and that view directive for

6
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.020
the color is super simple, it's view dot
directive color, passing in the EL and

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.850
the binding to change this and
the thing to note here is that

8
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.950
it's going to have to be a string value,
that red or that hex value.
