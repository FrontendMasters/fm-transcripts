&gt;&gt; Sarah: Okay let's go over the exercise.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.780
Did you feel like you could refactor
in to a component fairly easily?

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.310
Was that, pretty, pretty straight forward?

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.230
Yeah, you can actually get going and

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.910
actually abstract it away in to something
that's more manageable pretty easily.

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.690
So if we have our you know text,
ex template here and

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.900
I called mine ID place,
you probably called yours something else.

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.400
And then I wrapped it in a div and

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.000
I have the image sources image and I have
a slot where I'm replacing the content.

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.530
You don't have to do yours that
way if you don't want to and

11
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.250
then I have this description here so
in the component itself

12
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.690
I have props that are coming down from the
parent that are image, and description and

13
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.110
a template of place and
then here I'm using this location.

14
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.670
I just decided to use a slot for

15
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.960
this just to show how we could
even take it a step further.

16
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.310
But it's totally cool if
you have everything for

17
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.230
the place inside of the place, and
then we're passing that information

18
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.390
down from this parent to the child.

19
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.650
And then we're able to have it update in
all of these different components and

20
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.050
then we can reuse those
components as often as we need.

21
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.000
And in this case, of course,
we're using a v4 so

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.310
we're not having to Rewrite every
component every single time.

23
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.470
We're just gonna go in a loop
through all of these locations.
