00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.346
&gt;&gt; Sarah: We do have an exercise, but
I'm not sure if we have time to do it.

2
00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:08.740
You might wanna try it out later because
me just lecturing at you and showing you

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.160
code is probably not going to be the same
thing as actually trying to use it.

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.020
So we, what we have is this
comment form problem in the repo.

5
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.870
So let's go look at that very quickly.

6
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.721
You can maybe do this on your own time.

7
00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:27.221
And we have,

8
00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:51.800
&gt;&gt; Sarah: We have that simple
common form that we had before.

9
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.610
And this isn't like a good use case for

10
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.120
ViewX but
it's good practice if we open it up.

11
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.230
I'm wondering if we just go right
[LAUGH] to the solution for this.

12
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.160
Maybe we look at this really quickly and
then going into the solution.

13
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.137
We don't have a store we
haven't added that yet.

14
00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:17.710
So your task would be to add a store and
we have that individual comment.

15
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.955
And we would basically
wanna change all of the,

16
00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:27.899
adding the comments and
pushing the comments to be, mutations and

17
00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:34.240
have all of these comments actually
live as the state in our store.

18
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.080
So we would do all of this logic of owning
this state, and then pushing the comments.

19
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.960
So owning the state in the store and

20
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.800
then creating a mutation in the store
in order to create these new comments
