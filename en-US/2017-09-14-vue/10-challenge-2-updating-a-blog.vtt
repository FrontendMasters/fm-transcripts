00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.200
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
it's exercise time.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.150
I made a list of these blog posts, and in
these blog posts they each have a label.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.400
So we've got science, and
math, and all sorts of stuff.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.110
I want you to make a little
form that adds a new post.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.720
So the title, the author,
I spelled Mark's name wrong,

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.020
I was trying to control him and
it went horribly wrong.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.140
[LAUGH] And we're gonna add a label
here and then we'll add a new blog post.

8
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.380
And then we wanna filter with
a label all of these blog posts.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.640
So if we go to Math,

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.990
you can actually see that thingy,
Mark Grabinski at the bottom there.

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.410
So you're gonna use a method for
the form, and

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.640
you're going to use a computed
property for filtering.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.220
And here is the code pen
that you're working off of.

14
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.780
I think I have to make,
set this to public as well.

15
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.900
So you might need a refresh before you can
get in but this is your starting point.

16
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.810
You have,
all of the data is already there for

17
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.394
you so you don't have to make
up a bunch of blog posts.

18
00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:09.390
We've got new title, new author,
new label, all as empty strings.

19
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.540
We have a form,
I actually helped you out this time and

20
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.803
put select in options and
all of those input values so

21
00:01:17.803 --> 00:01:21.550
that you're not having to duplicate
the stuff that we already went over.

22
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.629
And then we have this select
v-model selected here, so yeah.
