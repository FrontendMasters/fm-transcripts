1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.960
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So what this course is,
it is an introductory course.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.080
If you are super Vue expert this
course is gonna be way review for you.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.900
We are really starting from the basics.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.200
It assumes no prior
framework experience at all.

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.230
So it's the stuff to get you going.

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.120
We're gonna cover so much ground today.

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.300
We're even gonna cover routing.

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.380
We're gonna cover directives.

9
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.560
We're gonna cover methods,
computed, watchers.

10
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.030
We're gonna dig in a little bit to
what's happening behind the scenes.

11
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.030
Not too far, but

12
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.170
just giving you the breadth of all
of the things available to you.

13
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.610
How to set things up with the CLI,
how to build out components.

14
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.770
So really, as much information
as I can give you in a day,

15
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.860
so that you can get
building things right away.

16
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.510
And if you need to do deep
dives into any specific area,

17
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.480
you can do that on your own.

18
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.610
Also Evan Nu is gonna give
an advanced class in a few months.

19
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.800
So if you're more interested in
continuing your information,

20
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.740
that's coming up as well.

21
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.640
We have a lot of exercises
to help you learn.

22
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.350
I'm gonna do some live coding, but,

23
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.000
mostly, I just have demo
after demo after demo.

24
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.700
And these are all collected for you.

25
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.780
So they're available in the slide decks,

26
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.250
and they're also available
in the CodePen collections.

27
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.190
The reason why I chose to do it that way
is because if you watch these videos and

28
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.280
then later on are trying to work and
be productive.

29
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.850
I want you to be able to go
exactly to that demo that you saw.

30
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.480
And look at the code there instead of
having to go rewatch me talking and

31
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.260
live coding for you.

32
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.840
So I try to keep them in
these small chunks, so

33
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.041
that all those resources are readily
available for you to use.

34
00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:47.350
And because I want you to see
the breadth of that material,

35
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.900
I'll sometimes go over the same
concept in a few different ways.

36
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.610
Because I don't want you to just get
used to that one way of working.

37
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.830
I want you to see how you can
make a comment form with it.

38
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.890
And then make another type of form, and
then make a list that you're rendering, or

39
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.880
make a first class thing.

40
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.310
So, just trying to get as much spread
of knowledge as humanly possible.

41
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.620
So that you get a deeper
understanding of how that's built.

42
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.194
So we're covering basic premises and
a couple of more advanced features.

43
00:02:16.194 --> 00:02:18.884
We're gonna do some more
advanced work with animation.

44
00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:22.290
We're gonna do stuff with
custom directives, and filters.

45
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.230
And mix ins that are a little
bit more advanced, but

46
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.681
just kinda covering the base ground more.

47
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:32.910
What we won't cover, we're not gonna
cover ES6 but we're gonna use it.

48
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.085
And the reason for that is that
ES6 is really a part of a modern

49
00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:39.485
JavaScript development workflow now.

50
00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:42.255
If there are pieces of ES6
that you don't know and

51
00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:45.515
you're uncomfortable with,
I can come around during the breaks,

52
00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:48.375
when you're doing the exercises and
kind of explain more.

53
00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:52.940
But I'm gonna be a little bit assumptive
that you have some ES6 knowledge.

54
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.550
The details are something
that we're not gonna cover.

55
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.940
We're not gonna go super deep into like 1
tiny thing, so that we can spread out and

56
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.770
learn more information.

57
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.960
We're not gonna talk about deployment and
testing today,

58
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.370
because we're gonna talk
about everything else.

59
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.860
So I apologize that we can't get there,
but

60
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.386
we do actually have a full day of work.

61
00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:16.830
And so
we're gonna be kept pretty busy here.

62
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.920
We're not going to cover edge cases for
that reason too.

63
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.650
We're just trying to get the widest
spread, so that you can get productive.

64
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.740
So before we start, the GitHub repo
that you probably already have, but

65
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.110
in case you don't is sdras/intro-to-vue.

66
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.060
In this, you'll see a bunch of different
smaller builds that we have here.

67
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.990
We have the Vue chrome devtools,

68
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.070
if you haven't already installed them,
you should do so now.

69
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.940
You don't have to get these
guys if you don't want to,

70
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.890
the chrome extension or
Vue sublime snippets.

71
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.946
But we are gonna be using CodePen today,
so you should get a free CodePen account.

72
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.960
Here are all of the slides
available to you as well.

73
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.320
They're password protected,
but the password's easy.

74
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.110
So you can always get in there,
and all the same.

75
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.980
I've made a collection of all of
the workshop materials in one place.

76
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.450
So anything that's not housed in this
repo exists in this materials collection.

77
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.430
Here's just a fun animation collection,
just in case you wanna

78
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.780
check out some of the more dazzling
things you can do with Vue.

79
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.320
For VueCLI resources,
we have an example build.

80
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.770
And we also have a more fun
demo that I'll go through.

81
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.240
We also have a set up, and
then we have next resources.

82
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.110
We have a whole bunch of them, and we
have a bunch of Vuex resources, as well.

83
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.220
And so that should get you going.

84
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.690
If you're not familiar with CodePen,
I'm just gonna do a really,

85
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.000
really quick lay of the land here.

86
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.690
I'll go here and go to create pen,
I can save this as private.

87
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.120
If I go into the JavaScript
tab by clicking on this here.

88
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.980
You can see that from this drop-down I
can select Babel as a pre-processor.

89
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.920
I suggest you do that,
you can also use type script or

90
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.670
whatever you feel comfortable with.

91
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.750
This is part of the reason why
I am using CodePen for this,

92
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.080
because before we cover the build
process you can get set up right away.

93
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.203
You can select the Vue
from this drop-down here.

94
00:05:15.203 --> 00:05:20.040
But it's the minified prod version so
it won't give you warnings or dev tools.

95
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.940
So, in most of the Pen,
I've included the CDN version.

96
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.270
That's not the development version,

97
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.230
but I'll show you how you can use
the dev tools anyway if you have those.

98
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.040
But you can also just type,
we're gonna use Axios for

99
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.920
couple of different demos, you can just
type in there and it will auto-fill.

100
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.890
In CSS, I'm using SCSS and
normalizing autoprefixer.

101
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.140
You don't need to do that
if you don't want to.

102
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.580
That's just letting you know.

103
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.810
And this is a fork, so if you need
to work on some of the exercises,

104
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.560
you hit that Fork button and save it.

105
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.740
And then you can work for on your own.

106
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.490
If you don't fork it and save it,
then if you hit that debug window.

107
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.091
You actually won't be
seeing your own work.

108
00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:03.635
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You mentioned Nuxt,

109
00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:07.305
people are asking what that is?

110
00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:09.610
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Nuxt,
I'm gonna go into more detail about Nuxt.

111
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.570
But we have a Vue CLI build, and that
build process will do a bunch of things.

112
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.940
It will concatenate and
build our files for

113
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.970
us with Webpack or Browser 5,
if you would like to use Browser 5.

114
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.000
There's another build process that we can
use available through a thing called Nuxt.

115
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.185
Nuxt offers server-side rendering,
and it's really fast.

116
00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:36.565
So fast it's Lighthouse scores
out of gate are super high,

117
00:06:36.565 --> 00:06:39.685
we're gonna go into detail about
all of these things, though.

118
00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:42.565
So if you don't know what Nuxt is,
that's okay.

119
00:06:42.565 --> 00:06:45.255
We're gonna cover all of
that in one of the sections.

120
00:06:47.035 --> 00:06:50.600
All right, if for some reason or

121
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.230
whatever reason you are using a minified
version or if I've left a minified version

122
00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.210
in one of the Pens, you can just
write vue.config.devtools = true.

123
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.491
And then you probably
have to hard refresh and

124
00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:05.400
then the Vue devtools will start working.

125
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.010
So don't worry if you have
that minified prod version.

126
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.841
You can either go get the development
version or you can use this.

127
00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:22.620
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Cool, all right,
so let's get started learning Vue.

128
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.040
We're gonna have a lot of fun today.
