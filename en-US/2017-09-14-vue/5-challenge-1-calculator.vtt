00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.805
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right.

2
00:00:00.805 --> 00:00:02.648
It's an exercise time.

3
00:00:02.648 --> 00:00:05.993
What I need you to do is
create a calculator and

4
00:00:05.993 --> 00:00:08.816
it's just gonna be simple addition.

5
00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:15.868
We have two number values, three and
eight is 11 and we're adding these.

6
00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:20.969
And then, we also have this
select that will conditionally

7
00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:26.791
render based on your selection,
my favorite kind of taco is blank.

8
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:31.515
So the thing that I'm gonna
give you is this CodePen.

9
00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:34.957
All we have in the CodePen
are these SPAN tags.

10
00:00:34.957 --> 00:00:40.151
And you're gonna attach
directives to these SPAN tags.

11
00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:44.657
And then we have this piece,
I didn't even put that select in there,

12
00:00:44.657 --> 00:00:49.607
because I want you to get use to writing
that select with the V model on it.

13
00:00:49.607 --> 00:00:50.734
I gave you something away.

14
00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:53.295
Well, you probably got that part.

15
00:00:53.295 --> 00:00:58.241
So I'm gonna give you ten minutes for
this, if you feel like you need a little

16
00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:01.660
bit more time,
I can give you a little bit more time.

17
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.898
But just a really quick
directives exercise, kay.
