00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.710
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
we're gonna do a quick exercise and

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.850
then we're gonna keep going.

3
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.687
So, fork this pen,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And I'll make it public.

4
00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:19.271
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This pen has all of
the things kind of rigged up for you.

5
00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:24.361
So you have a transition, and
I'm gonna say bouncein and rollout here,

6
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:29.160
but you can change the name of
these enter and active classes.

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.540
And everything's basically set up,
all you have to do is rate the,

8
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.330
not all you have to do,
I should not say it like that.

9
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.490
But what you should do is
either take these classes or

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.850
name them something else and plug CSS
animations into those two classes,

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.380
one for entrance and one for exit.

12
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.080
Extra points if they're
slightly different.
