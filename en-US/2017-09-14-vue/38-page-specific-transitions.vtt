00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.410
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: We can also
make a page specific hooks.

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.910
So sometimes, we want one page
to transition out a certain way,

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.910
and another one to transition
in a different way.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.166
In that case,
in our export default for that page,

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:16.637
remember how our pages are just view
files in that page's directory,

6
00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:21.812
we would write export default, and then,
we would say transition, whatever.

7
00:00:21.812 --> 00:00:25.452
Another name, and then,
we have that name for the hook, instead.

8
00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:28.492
I could have the page bounced out
like we had the ball bounced out,

9
00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:29.607
we shouldn't do that.

10
00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:33.232
But, [LAUGH] I'm just saying
that that is a possibility,

11
00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:36.869
you could plug into animate.css
stuff if you so desire.

12
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.310
So then, we have fadeOpacity-enter-active,
fadeOpacity-leave-active.

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.120
We can even scope it if we want to.

14
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.230
We don't necessarily need to, because
it's just applying to that page as it is.

15
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.821
So there we go, and then,
this one will fade instead.

16
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:59.702
So the other ones are going like this,
and then,

17
00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:03.652
that one in specific is going to
use a different type of animation.

18
00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:06.659
Page-specific JavaScript hooks,

19
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.930
that's really where the good
stuff is at in my mind.

20
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.078
We have all of that
goodness available to us.

21
00:01:15.078 --> 00:01:20.364
But the way that we're going to plug
into it, is going to be the way

22
00:01:20.364 --> 00:01:25.285
that they have for us,
like exactly on that export default.

23
00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.667
So instead of writing
a transition component,

24
00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:30.950
we're not actually wrapping
things in a transition component.

25
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.475
We're going to say transition, and
then, we're going to say mode, out in.

26
00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:42.499
We're gonna say css false,
we're gonna say beforeLeave, leave,

27
00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:47.879
beforeEnter, enter, and all these
things so we can cancel all of those.

28
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:51.539
And these are all just available
to us on each specific page, or

29
00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.230
in that default layouts.

30
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.360
Remember, we had the default layouts
area where we could designate things?

31
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.980
So if we look at some of the code that it
took to power that max transition page,

32
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.570
we have a beforeEnter, that looks very
similar to our beforeEnter from before.

33
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.750
We have enter, the el, and done.

34
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.590
In this case, I'm using TweenMax, not
timeline, so I can just say done, instead.

35
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.685
And I can have a bunch of different code.

36
00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:22.666
Here, this is ridiculous,
don't ever do this.

37
00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:28.991
I'm just showing you that a lot of
things are possible here, [LAUGH].

38
00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:33.359
It's sometimes fun to make dumb things for
other people [LAUGH].

39
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.820
So I had some single elements in there.

40
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.170
I can plug into single elements, as well.

41
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.160
Probably good to use a refs,
to use refs in this instance.

42
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.220
So you could say this dot
refs on the components.

43
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.970
So if you're used to react, that's a
really quick way of referring to that DOM

44
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.390
element, but some of these libraries allow
you to access that DOM node directly,

45
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.550
and it's a little bit redundant.

46
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.550
So for green sock,
I'm just plugging into that h1.

47
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.709
And I can also plug into Lifecycle Hooks,
like I did before, as well.
