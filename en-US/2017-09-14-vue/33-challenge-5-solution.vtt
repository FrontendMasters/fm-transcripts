&gt;&gt; Sarah: Was not that hard to work with,
right?

2
00:00:02.427 --> 00:00:06.569
Like you just plug those classes in and
it gets ready and it does it for

3
00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.800
you whenever the thing is mounting and
unmounting.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.920
That's like a really common use case,
so I think that that's a pretty

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.950
slick solution that View has come up
with to hook into that kind of activity.

6
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.410
Particularly, because when
something is entering and

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.920
exiting, you kind of want hooks for
those events.

8
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.110
You don't want things to
just show up on the page.

9
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.380
You wanna be able to kind
of have them come in,

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.539
in a little bit more graceful of a way.
