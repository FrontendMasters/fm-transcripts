&gt;&gt; Sarah: This exercise,
if you do wanna do it on your own,

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.490
was basically to make a filter that
says based on whatever number is here,

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.480
you have first, second, third,
fourth, or fifth place.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.110
Because you don't wanna
say you won to place and

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.933
with this like V model number input.

6
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:22.947
And then there was a custom directive that
just changed the color to whatever color

7
00:00:22.947 --> 00:00:23.710
the user said.

8
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.640
So, it would be like V color red,
or V color magenta, and

9
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.550
it could change the color.
