&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, same thing.

2
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.990
We've got a comment form.

3
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.930
It looks exactly the same, but
it does not function the same.

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.740
If we wanted to refactor this,
we'd make the store file.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.740
One of the first things we'd
do is import store from store.

6
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.680
We'd have the store here.

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.190
In the store itself we've moved
these comments to the state.

8
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.280
And then in mutations we have add comment.

9
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.600
We are always gonna pass on the state.

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.760
And then we have comment here.

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.059
So then when we look at the components
themselves, we would go to the app.view.

12
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.500
And in here we have,

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.970
I'm still using that new common as
an empty string in the component.

14
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.050
Because the state doesn't
necessary need to have that.

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.330
It's kind of a temporary unit for us.

16
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.320
So not everything needs
to move into the store.

17
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.450
Some things are not, you know,
worthy of going into the store.

18
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.690
In this case,
this new comment is really just so

19
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.930
that we can push material area out.

20
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.230
So we wouldn't change that.

21
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.525
So in our computed value,
we're gonna say comments is return this

22
00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:11.830
.store.state.comments, so we can access
all of the comments and the state.

23
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.430
And then we have methods.

24
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.752
We have this.store.commit,
addComment, this.newComment, and

25
00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:22.440
then we clear out this.newComment,
which is still in our component.

26
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.160
So the things that are actually from
our store are these comments, and

27
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.150
adding comments is a method,
which is also a mutation on that store
