&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: There are some things
that people have misconceptions about view

2
00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:07.294
in their minds in terms of components.

3
00:00:07.294 --> 00:00:11.786
And one is that you have to use string
templates in order to use components,

4
00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:13.160
that's not true.

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.114
We are gonna talk about string templates
because we're basically going to

6
00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:22.517
go from the easiest to use and
the least useful to the most useful and

7
00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:24.260
kind of hardest to set up.

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.420
But, it's kind of helpful for
understanding.

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.583
Vue uses HTML based template syntax to
bind the view instance to the DOM so

10
00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:37.230
it's really very useful for components.

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.926
Templates are optional,
you can also write render functions,

12
00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:44.790
and there's JSX support so
you can use whatever you like.

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.460
But we'll start with template strings,
only useful for really small.

14
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.990
All use cases, and literally small,
only a little bit of information.

15
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.293
Then we'll go to scripts, and
then to single file templates in the next

16
00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:02.820
section where we set up a build
process that parses those.

17
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.090
So we just can't go into view in that
landscape without kind of looking at

18
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.690
the way that view
typically sets things up.

19
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.440
So we don't actually even need
a component to use a template,

20
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.510
I think that that's worth clarifying.

21
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.010
We could use template directly on
a view instance if we wanted to.

22
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.460
So I can say div ID app and
here's the div here.

23
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.340
And then in my view instance, I establish
a relationship with the element.

24
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.420
And I say template div,
and hello Mr. Magoo.

25
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.610
If I wanna change that to h,
that's not valid markup.

26
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.950
If I wanna change that to h1
then it will update accordingly.

27
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.220
So that really, this template is a string
that is getting put inside that gif.

28
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.150
That's the smallest, simplest example,
not very useful though.

29
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.170
So in talking about components,
now let's move over to components.

30
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.141
I think when we're building out web
applications, what ends up happening or

31
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:07.423
what used to end up happening is
we'd have these giant pages with so

32
00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:09.730
much information and so much crud.

33
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.178
And so if you are coming in to a project
and called, you are like okay,

34
00:02:14.178 --> 00:02:16.570
I gotta go update the header.

35
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.890
Where is the header,
where I'm I, what is going on?

36
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.496
So I think a little while ago we kind
of got used to this idea like maybe

37
00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:26.738
we need to obstruct these little pieces.

38
00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:32.817
So we've got, in this instance I have
got a really tiny example of header,

39
00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:39.300
aside, sidebar, item in items, main
blog posts before post and post footer.

40
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.130
That could be a real page and
that is not lot to figure out.

41
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.309
If I need to go update the header and I
jumped into this code I'll be lik, right,

42
00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:46.930
okay, I'm gonna go to the header then.

43
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.135
Or right, okay,
I'm gonna go to the side bar item, and

44
00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:52.670
that's where I'm gonna go find that code.

45
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.270
So it's very useful,
very useful to stay productive.
