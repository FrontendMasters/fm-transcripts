WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we need to add another loader.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.850
We wanna be able to load JSON files.

3
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.360
Reason being is that I have a bunch
of just JSON data for us to consume.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.360
But you have to tell Webpack
how to consume JSON.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.937
So what we're gonna do here is
we're gonna put another loader.

6
00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:24.050
And not particularly important

7
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.215
the order, say test: and

8
00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:33.170
we're gonna say /\.json.

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.580
So if it ends in JSON then
you're going to use a loader of,

10
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.789
you probably could probably guess,
json-loader.

11
00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:46.719
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
all it does is load JSON files for you so

12
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.949
you can import JSON files just
like you import js files.

13
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.550
So, we put in this JSON loader right here
so now we can put in, we can load JSON.

14
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.470
If you wanna look at the data,

15
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.930
that JSON file, it's just a bunch
of Netflix shows like I told you.

16
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.660
This is just a ploy to get
you to subscribe to Netflix.

17
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.390
And it has an IMDB id, has a poster,
has a trailer, all that kind of stuff.

18
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.390
So now we can pull this into our app.

19
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.670
So go to search.js and what we want
to do here is we wanna to say import.

20
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.112
Preload from'../public/data.json'.

21
00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:33.530
This is gonna just load as a normal
JavaScript object as you may expect.

22
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.132
Okay.
What we gonna do here's we gonna say

23
00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:44.515
className="search".

24
00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:51.147
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're going to do,
I'm just going to do,

25
00:01:51.147 --> 00:01:54.660
like a dirty little trick real quick so
we can kind of visualize our data.

26
00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.532
I'm going to say
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{JSON.stringify()}

27
00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:10.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Preload, null, 4.

28
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.570
Preformatted that's an HTML tag.

29
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.860
Code which means I want to
put code out into the page.

30
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.620
Those are just HTML tags,
part of HTML specifications.

31
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.760
Then this is a JavaScript
expression right, curly braces, and

32
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.902
then JSON.stringify.

33
00:02:26.902 --> 00:02:30.325
I think Most of us have debugged
code with JSON.stringify before.

34
00:02:32.683 --> 00:02:35.934
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, worst interview
question I ever got asked in the history

35
00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:37.980
of being interviewed.

36
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.814
What are the three
parameters to JSON.string?

37
00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:46.915
[LAUGH] And I was so mad with the guy.

38
00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:50.325
I was like, I know the answer to that
question, but I think it's really stupid.

39
00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:54.425
I didn't get the job, because I was
kind of an ass to him about it.

40
00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:55.405
In case you're wondering,

41
00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:57.925
the first one is the date that
you're trying stringify, right?

42
00:02:57.925 --> 00:03:01.540
I think Moses got the last one that
what the indentation you want, right?

43
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.170
But null.

44
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.340
Like you always put null, and you never
put anything other than besides null.

45
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.840
So what is it?

46
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.480
It's a replace your function,
that'll actually go through and

47
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.460
replace things in your JSON structure.

48
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.150
I don't know why they
thought that was a good idea-

49
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:15.131
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Passwords.

50
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:15.941
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Passwords?

51
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:18.695
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, you want to
obfuscate passwords in your data.

52
00:03:18.695 --> 00:03:19.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I mean,

53
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.378
I guess I don't know why I would want that
to be a part of the stringify function

54
00:03:23.378 --> 00:03:24.200
though.

55
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.490
But I guess people do it, so.

56
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.043
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What would you want
formatting is part of the string of 500.

57
00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:30.758
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH] I guess.

58
00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:31.810
Fair enough.

59
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.446
Could they have not just done
four at comma null, right?

60
00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:39.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay that's the most valid

61
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.440
reason I've heard so far, so.

62
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.278
Kudos.

63
00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:48.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, come back here
to your search page and refresh.

64
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.338
And you should see, get rid of that,

65
00:03:51.338 --> 00:03:55.560
a bunch of just data being
output to the screen, right?

66
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:04.114
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, good so far?

67
00:04:06.197 --> 00:04:10.436
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This pre code
hack works great for React.

68
00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:13.080
The stuff that I would kind of
follow away in the back of my head,

69
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.179
it's really good for
debugging code in React.

70
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.070
I definitely stole that
from Ryan Florence.

71
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.609
Not invented here, put it that way.

72
00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:30.275
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm getting like

73
00:04:30.275 --> 00:04:33.174
an unexpected token in the data.JSON.

74
00:04:33.174 --> 00:04:34.770
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did you modify it?

75
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No I didn't touch it.

76
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.309
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You need a JSON loader.

77
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I got to reload it.

78
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.960
Thing.

79
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.774
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
make sure you start and stop your-

80
00:04:41.774 --> 00:04:42.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Webpack?

81
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah your Webpack.
