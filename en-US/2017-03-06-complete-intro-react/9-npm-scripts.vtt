00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna talk
about NPM Scripts for just a second.

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.158
A lot of times when you're having
build tools or testing or linting or

3
00:00:07.158 --> 00:00:11.370
any one of these, like we have to run
these long commands to get them to work.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.194
It's really tough to remember
those off the top of your head,

5
00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:15.180
at least it is for me.

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.071
Like when we run our testing suite at
Netflix, you have to run it with ten

7
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:22.060
different flags to get it to work just the
way that you're expecting it to work, and

8
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.320
that's really hard to remember.

9
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.540
So NPM includes this thing called scripts
that you can put in your package.json.

10
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.950
That basically says like, here's a short
list of commands that you don't have to

11
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.440
remember, you just have to remember what
it's called and I'll run this for you.

12
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.590
With some other extra magic.

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.390
But that's a good basic description of it.

14
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.662
So, in our particular case,
we want it to say, every time we say, hey,

15
00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:52.616
run our linter.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then I

16
00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:53.905
want you to just run standard.

17
00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:58.852
And you can basically think of
whatever in the second part is just

18
00:00:58.852 --> 00:01:03.339
going to be piped into bash for
you, or whatever your shell

19
00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.695
is.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

20
00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:12.729
So if I save that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

21
00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.365
I go to my command line, and

22
00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:20.651
I say npm run lint.

23
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:25.130
Now this is just gonna say, hey I'm gonna
just run standard cuz that's what you told

24
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.031
me to do when you say run lint.

25
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.610
So this is just a really easy thing to

26
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.020
remember your particular projects,
nuances.

27
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.250
Standard's not super
useful because obviously,

28
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.440
it's easier to remember standard.

29
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.326
But as we get more and more complicated
build commands, this will be very useful

30
00:01:42.326 --> 00:01:47.468
very quickly.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

31
00:01:47.468 --> 00:01:50.990
my kind of caveat I'll give you here.

32
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.590
A lot of people try to replace Grunt and
Gulp with their NPM scripts.

33
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.226
I don't necessarily suggest that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you have a big,

34
00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:05.275
complicated build process with Gulp or
with Grunt or anything like that,

35
00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:09.400
trying to replicate that inside
of NPM scripts is kind of a pain.

36
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.400
Our builds are gonna be fairly simple.

37
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.950
So we can get away with
getting NPM scripts.

38
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.840
But as soon as you find yourself
like rebuilding Grunt using Bash,

39
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.164
you've gone too far.

40
00:02:19.164 --> 00:02:22.596
[LAUGH] Like, build a Grunt file or
a Gulp file or

41
00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:26.360
whatever build process
you find that you like.

42
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.485
And then go from there.

43
00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:31.000
But until that point, NPM scripts works.

44
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.550
But there is a place for Gulp and Grunt
these days, those are still useful tools.
