WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Martin's asking
what's needed to get the preact to

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.620
work on the server side.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.310
go check out the preact docs.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There was a comment,

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.870
or a question that flew by and

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.370
I can't find it anymore.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.800
about VOO.

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: VOO.

8
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.050
I mean, you already said your thoughts on

9
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.180
VOO.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No,

10
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.090
it was about what starter kits
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't use starter kits.

11
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.330
I like.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Do you

12
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.600
have any recommendations?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other than create react

13
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.090
apps, that's one I probably should
have touched on a little bit

14
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.610
more.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

15
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Creat react app is from

16
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.080
the react team.

17
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.440
And basically, all that tooling that
we spent all this time talking about,

18
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.280
it takes care of all of that for you.

19
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.720
So it takes care of web pack Babel hot
module reload, which we didn't do in here.

20
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.800
And it just automatically sets that up for
you and just auto generates all of it.

21
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.040
It builds for production,
it builds for development.

22
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.759
You can run on just Create React App for
a long time but it has no configuration.

23
00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:02.757
The cool part about create React app is
as soon as you're done, I don't know,

24
00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:04.207
I guess I can show you.

25
00:01:04.207 --> 00:01:10.594
If I say npm, all right,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: npm

26
00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:15.012
install --global create-react

27
00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:20.064
app
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

28
00:01:20.064 --> 00:01:24.023
then I say create-react-app test.

29
00:01:24.023 --> 00:01:28.120
It's going to scaffold up a project for
me.

30
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.130
Much like Yeoman or
the Rails Generator or whatever.

31
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.050
It's going to download
all of my dependencies,

32
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.020
it's gonna set up a basic
like hello world.

33
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.480
And it should just pop up my browser
with my hello, world already working.

34
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.010
The moment you have grown beyond
what Create React app does for you,

35
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.950
you run npm run eject.

36
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.740
It then ejects all the configuration
files, removes itself from the project,

37
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.200
and then you're on your own to
manage your own configurations.

38
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.900
Super slick, it's an amazing way
to get started building an App.

39
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.390
It's a good way to get started,

40
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.970
and then, after you have learned all the
tools, as well, it's a really good way to

41
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.710
just not have to deal with the tools.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's also a good way

42
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.740
to, kind of,

43
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.530
take a look at best practices of today.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like,

44
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.007
what the Facebook Team is actually doing.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, exactly.

45
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.360
Checking out Yeah.

46
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.030
Exactly what they're doing and some of the
things, like why they're changing venues.

47
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.910
For instance,
they're trying to get support for

48
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.530
progressive web apps out of the box,
stuff like that.

49
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.020
But you can always eject from createrep
app, take a look at their settings,

50
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.490
and put it into your project, too.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yup.

51
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Do you have any suggestions

52
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.780
or opinion on using directories
to organize your React app?

53
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm terrible at

54
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.540
organization.

55
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.752
And I assert that everyone is
terrible at code organization.

56
00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:56.180
Actually the react router has some pretty
good examples of core organization just

57
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.490
like with the really examples.

58
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.764
So one might consider checking that out.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah

59
00:03:02.764 --> 00:03:07.576
that looks great we do npm star.t
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: cd text npm start.

60
00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:18.821
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there we go.

61
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.148
This is all just scuffle
that I would format and

62
00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:27.427
do anything,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

63
00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:32.656
if you go into this directory,
cd test sublime You

64
00:03:32.656 --> 00:03:37.522
can see here it has the package.json for
you.

65
00:03:37.522 --> 00:03:41.190
Pretty barebones.

66
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.770
Has an app, has a css index.

67
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.370
All this stuff for you just built in.

68
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.900
Public directory to
serve your favicon from.

69
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.859
All that stuff,
it's just kind of built out for

70
00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.790
you
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then if you look here,

71
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.160
as soon as I run npm run eject,
let's just do that for fun.

72
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.380
Keep in mind run eject is a one way
street or one way ticket, right.

73
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.815
You can't uneject once you eject So,
just be careful about that,

74
00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:18.616
This action is permanent, yes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

75
00:04:18.616 --> 00:04:26.886
now look at everything that it added.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So-

76
00:04:26.886 --> 00:04:27.746
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Some folks are also

77
00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:29.360
wondering what your thoughts are on

78
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.700
React Boilerplate.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

79
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.300
no, Max Stoiber writes that.

80
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.270
Super smart guy, so that's another
good place to look for best practices.

81
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.650
It includes a lot as well.

82
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.050
To articulate why I don't
typically start with a boiler

83
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.810
plate is I think it abstracts away some of
the things that you need to understand.

84
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.630
And it's a good thing to
Dip your toe in real quick.

85
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.330
Is this something I like or not.

86
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.840
But if you like it you
really should go back and

87
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.400
build something from scratch learning
all the different pieces of it.

88
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.140
Otherwise you are like I said
going to resent your tools and

89
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.480
If you resent your tools and
they are not useful to you?

90
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.550
So it pays dividends to know
what your tools are doing.

91
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.840
So that's why I do that.

92
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.180
What is going on with,

93
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.860
all right there, okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's still

94
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.890
npm-installing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

95
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I love the shirt.

96
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.440
I think it's Todd Motto
that has the shirt.

97
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.750
It's npm-install and chill.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah right.

98
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's in the Netflix font.

99
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The Netflix font.

100
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: [LAUGH] That's cool.

101
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: npm-install and

102
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.450
chill.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,

103
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.510
if we go back in here, you can see that
there's a bunch more stuff in here.

104
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.660
Sorry, that's the wrong file.

105
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.220
This one.

106
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.231
There's a whole config directory now,
that there's the m configuration,

107
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:57.867
paths, polifils, webpack config for
dev, webpack and fill for

108
00:05:57.867 --> 00:06:03.553
prod there's adjust config,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Bunch of stuff.

109
00:06:03.553 --> 00:06:05.690
So it does a bunch of stuff for you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And

110
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.980
it's also a great way to
eject from like we said, and

111
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.180
take a look at the settings, and-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Absolutely.

112
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Decide which ones are right

113
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.610
for your project and pull them in.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.
