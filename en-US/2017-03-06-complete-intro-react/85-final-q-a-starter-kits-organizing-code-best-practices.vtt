1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Martin's asking
what's needed to get the preact to

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.790
work on the server side.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just go
check out the preact docs.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There was a comment,

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.160
or a question that flew by and
I can't find it anymore.

6
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's about VOO.

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.370
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What?

8
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: VOO.
I mean,

9
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.890
you already said your thoughts on VOO.

10
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.449
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No,
it was about what starter kits

11
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.090
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't use starter kits.

12
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.790
I like.

13
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Do you
have any recommendations?

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other
than create react apps,

15
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.400
that's one I probably should have
touched on a little bit more.

16
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Creat react app is from

17
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.080
the react team.

18
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.440
And basically, all that tooling that
we spent all this time talking about,

19
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.280
it takes care of all of that for you.

20
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.720
So it takes care of web pack Babel hot
module reload, which we didn't do in here.

21
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.800
And it just automatically sets that up for
you and just auto generates all of it.

22
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.040
It builds for production,
it builds for development.

23
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.759
You can run on just Create React App for
a long time but it has no configuration.

24
00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:02.757
The cool part about create React app is
as soon as you're done, I don't know,

25
00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:04.207
I guess I can show you.

26
00:01:04.207 --> 00:01:10.594
If I say npm, all right,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: npm

27
00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:15.012
install --global create-react

28
00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:20.064
app
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

29
00:01:20.064 --> 00:01:24.023
then I say create-react-app test.

30
00:01:24.023 --> 00:01:28.120
It's going to scaffold up a project for
me.

31
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.130
Much like Yeoman or
the Rails Generator or whatever.

32
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.050
It's going to download
all of my dependencies,

33
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.020
it's gonna set up a basic
like hello world.

34
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.480
And it should just pop up my browser
with my hello, world already working.

35
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.010
The moment you have grown beyond
what Create React app does for you,

36
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.950
you run npm run eject.

37
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.740
It then ejects all the configuration
files, removes itself from the project,

38
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.200
and then you're on your own to
manage your own configurations.

39
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.900
Super slick, it's an amazing way
to get started building an App.

40
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.960
It's a good way to get started, and then,
after you have learned all the tools,

41
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.020
as well, it's a really good way to
just not have to deal with the tools.

42
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's also a good way to,
kind of,

43
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.350
take a look at best practices of today.

44
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.876
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like,
what the Facebook Team is actually doing.

45
00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:14.007
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, exactly.

46
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.360
Checking out Yeah.

47
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.030
Exactly what they're doing and some of the
things, like why they're changing venues.

48
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.910
For instance,
they're trying to get support for

49
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.530
progressive web apps out of the box,
stuff like that.

50
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.690
But you can always eject
from createrep app,

51
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.380
take a look at their settings, and
put it into your project, too.

52
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yup.

53
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Do you
have any suggestions or

54
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.780
opinion on using directories
to organize your React app?

55
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm
terrible at organization.

56
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.752
And I assert that everyone is
terrible at code organization.

57
00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:56.180
Actually the react router has some pretty
good examples of core organization just

58
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.490
like with the really examples.

59
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.360
So one might consider checking that out.

60
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah that
looks great we do npm star.t

61
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.576
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: cd text npm start.

62
00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:18.821
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there we go.

63
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.148
This is all just scuffle
that I would format and

64
00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:27.427
do anything,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

65
00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:32.656
if you go into this directory,
cd test sublime You

66
00:03:32.656 --> 00:03:37.522
can see here it has the package.json for
you.

67
00:03:37.522 --> 00:03:41.190
Pretty barebones.

68
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.770
Has an app, has a css index.

69
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.370
All this stuff for you just built in.

70
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.900
Public directory to
serve your favicon from.

71
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.859
All that stuff,
it's just kind of built out for

72
00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.790
you
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then if you look here,

73
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.160
as soon as I run npm run eject,
let's just do that for fun.

74
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.380
Keep in mind run eject is a one way
street or one way ticket, right.

75
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.486
You can't uneject once you eject So,

76
00:04:10.486 --> 00:04:15.544
just be careful about that,
This action is permanent, yes.

77
00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:19.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now look at everything that it added.

78
00:04:26.094 --> 00:04:27.746
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Some folks are also

79
00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:30.340
wondering what your thoughts
are on React Boilerplate.

80
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, no,
Max Stoiber writes that.

81
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.270
Super smart guy, so that's another
good place to look for best practices.

82
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.650
It includes a lot as well.

83
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.050
To articulate why I don't
typically start with a boiler

84
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.810
plate is I think it abstracts away some of
the things that you need to understand.

85
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.630
And it's a good thing to
Dip your toe in real quick.

86
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.330
Is this something I like or not.

87
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.840
But if you like it you
really should go back and

88
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.400
build something from scratch learning
all the different pieces of it.

89
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.140
Otherwise you are like I said
going to resent your tools and

90
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.480
If you resent your tools and
they are not useful to you?

91
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.550
So it pays dividends to know
what your tools are doing.

92
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.840
So that's why I do that.

93
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.960
What is going on with,
all right there, okay.

94
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's still npm-installing.

95
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I love the shirt.

96
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.440
I think it's Todd Motto
that has the shirt.

97
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.370
It's npm-install and chill.

98
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's in the Netflix font.

99
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The Netflix font.

100
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: [LAUGH] That's cool.

101
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: npm-install and chill.

102
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
if we go back in here,

103
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.510
you can see that there's
a bunch more stuff in here.

104
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.660
Sorry, that's the wrong file.

105
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.220
This one.

106
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.231
There's a whole config directory now,
that there's the m configuration,

107
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:57.867
paths, polifils, webpack config for
dev, webpack and fill for

108
00:05:57.867 --> 00:06:03.553
prod there's adjust config,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Bunch of stuff.

109
00:06:03.553 --> 00:06:05.600
So it does a bunch of stuff for you.

110
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And it's also a great
way to eject from like we said,

111
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.180
and take a look at the settings, and-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Absolutely.

112
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Decide which ones are right
for your project and pull them in.

113
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.
