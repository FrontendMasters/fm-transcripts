[MUSIC]

2
00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:43.831
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So my name is Brian Holt,
living in San Francisco, but

3
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:48.686
I consider myself more of
a Salt Lake citizen, from Utah.

4
00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:54.460
Yeah, this is day 7 and
day 8 of the workshop Frontend Masters.

5
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.980
My day job's at Netflix currently, but the
first time I gave a workshop here I was

6
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.205
working at Reddit,
which was an adventure into itself.

7
00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:04.780
[LAUGH] That's a story for another day and

8
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.883
like four more beers.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

9
00:01:07.883 --> 00:01:11.085
I also do a podcast right now
called Front End Happy Hour,

10
00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:14.100
which people seem to like as
well which is kind of fun.

11
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.610
We just, have you ever seen
the show Drunk History right?

12
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.900
We had this idea is like we
should do drunk JavaScript.

13
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.644
And so
that's kinda how this podcast came up.

14
00:01:22.644 --> 00:01:24.400
And it's really fun.

15
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.154
We just get shithoused, and
then talk about JavaScript.

16
00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.155
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

17
00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:30.769
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it's pretty fun.

18
00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:33.320
But yeah, now I'm super stoked to be here.

19
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.097
Please ask all of your questions,

20
00:01:35.097 --> 00:01:39.150
this workshop gets a lot better if we
have lots of direction from the audience.

21
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.822
I try and remember what it's
like learning these things but

22
00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:46.540
I learned React like three
years ago at this point.

23
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.760
Is that true?

24
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.700
That feels like eternity in React terms,
right?

25
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.303
I launched Reddit's first React code.

26
00:01:55.303 --> 00:01:58.891
Like a responsible adult,
I Just totally rewrote a core piece of

27
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:03.290
out infrastructure, launched it,
and went on vacation all in React.

28
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.990
We used to be on Angular one two.

29
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.080
And actually ended up doing okay,
which is the funny part about that.

30
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.740
That's kind of how I kind
of stumbled into React.

31
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.325
Yeah, no, it's really great and

32
00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:22.207
I think you're really gonna like it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So as you can see here,

33
00:02:22.207 --> 00:02:26.330
I'm on this page here,
the Complete Intro to React page.

34
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.780
There is a Version 1 of this workshop,
so I'm just gonna go take a look at it.

35
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.910
You don't have to necessarily follow me,
which is an entirely separate repo.

36
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.790
You can see up here it says B1.

37
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.320
So this is an older recording
of the same workshop.

38
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.890
Using slightly different
technology stack and

39
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.800
older version of all these different
libraries, but actually is still useful,

40
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.990
there is still permanent
information there.

41
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.950
So if you need to refer this like,
this is still out there.

42
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.800
This is gonna use mocha child sign up for

43
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.150
testing, it's going to use older
version of React router which

44
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.109
people are still using.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah and

45
00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.841
it's got some other good tidbits
in there so just beware that,

46
00:03:08.841 --> 00:03:13.663
that exist but this is been totally
updated for this new workshop

47
00:03:13.663 --> 00:03:18.542
that we're doing right here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

48
00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:23.258
if, by the way there's a short
link if you do nho.lt/react.

49
00:03:23.258 --> 00:03:28.243
This will take you to this page.

50
00:03:28.243 --> 00:03:33.960
That is just easier for me to remember.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah.

51
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.359
We're gonna be talking about
the complete intro to React.

52
00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.240
And when I say complete intro,
I mean we're gonna talk about React.

53
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.450
But React itself,
a library is not really that big.

54
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.340
In terms of the API for
it, it's not very big.

55
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.872
It only has 30 or so methods,
or something like that.

56
00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:55.200
I probably should go
count one of these days.

57
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.070
I keep quoting my figure,
and I'm just making it up.

58
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.680
But suffice to say, it's pretty
small as compared to Angular 1.2,

59
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.628
that's the last time I worked in Angular,
so forgive me if it's a little dated.

60
00:04:06.628 --> 00:04:10.210
But Angular 1.2 I think had
over 200 methods available.

61
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.660
And the only reason I bring
up that comparison is,

62
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.640
you can know the entire React library.

63
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.158
Like it's a knowable quantity, right?

64
00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:23.730
Like after today, you will know
almost well, today and tomorrow.

65
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.934
But after this workshop, you'll know more
or less the whole surface area of React.

66
00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.313
Whereas if you do an angular workshop,

67
00:04:30.313 --> 00:04:35.150
there's no chance you're gonna cover
the whole library it just does too much.

68
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.030
So, that would be just React, but

69
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.160
we're gonna be talking about
everything that goes around React.

70
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.720
So, a lot of people's frustrations when
they start with React cuz there's so

71
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.070
much going on.

72
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.630
There's so many different pieces, right?

73
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.210
There's WebPack, there's Babel,
there's like all these different pieces

74
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.570
that have to fit together before
your page even starts up, right?

75
00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.020
And that's a big part of the frustration.

76
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.060
So that's what this workshop really
aims to kind of help you with.

77
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.660
It aims to basically, we're gonna
start doing something in React, right.

78
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.352
And then we're gonna replicate
some sort of pain point, right.

79
00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.990
And you're gonna say that,
I wish I didn't have to do this.

80
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.290
And then I'm gonna show you the tool that
helps you get around that pain point.

81
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.239
Now tools introduce complexity like
that's just the nature of the beast as

82
00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:25.328
soon as you add more tools to whatever
you're doing it becomes more complex.

83
00:05:25.328 --> 00:05:29.590
But you have to kind of weigh
the complexity, does it add ease right?

84
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.110
I'm making my project more complex but
I'm making it easier to work on.

85
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.200
And I think that's a big problem
with people's staring with

86
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.870
reactors we just throw the entire
kitchen sink at the site

87
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.550
here is the easiest thing to do with
React some people like this is great

88
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.670
what the hell is actually
going on with my app right.

89
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.470
And so that's kind of the style
of this workshop is like

90
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.600
let's hit all the pin points let's
understand why the tools exist and

91
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.720
then they'll show how to use the tool.

92
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.360
So that's kinda the idea,
hopefully that's a good style for you.
