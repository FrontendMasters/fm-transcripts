00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna say Yarn,
which is the same as npm install.

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
it's gonna go fetch all those packages.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.588
You're gonna get a bunch
of these warnings.

4
00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:12.517
Ignore them,
cuz we're using a bunch of alpha and

5
00:00:12.517 --> 00:00:15.316
beta versions today,
cuz that's a good idea.

6
00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:20.564
[LAUGH] So it's gonna think that
you have incorrect dependencies.

7
00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:21.952
They're fine, I promise.

8
00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:26.348
Just ignore the warnings,
famous last words.

9
00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:29.837
But notice we just
installed 800 dependencies,

10
00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:32.730
which is like Node problems, right?

11
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.480
But that was only done in 11 seconds.

12
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.285
If this was done on npm I imagine
it would take a lot longer.

13
00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:43.433
So now if we go look
into our node modules,

14
00:00:45.317 --> 00:00:47.115
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna say ls, and

15
00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:52.700
just look at how many, we definitely
don't have all of these inside of

16
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.396
our package.json, so where did all
of these dependencies come from?

17
00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:02.587
Node-emoji, I did not
install that [LAUGH].

18
00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:06.727
Now that I know it exists,
I want to, though.

19
00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:11.535
The reason is that Yarn installs all of
your dependencies in a flat structure, and

20
00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:14.053
then it just links them together, right?

21
00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:18.690
So if you go into, I don't know,
let's go to yargs.

22
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:28.743
And we look inside of yargs,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Interesting.

23
00:01:32.128 --> 00:01:36.108
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway,
I'm not actually sure how it works.

24
00:01:36.108 --> 00:01:38.070
Now that I'm looking at it, nope.

25
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.670
But, suffice it

26
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.486
to say that they're assembling together
when they request their dependencies.

27
00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:50.170
Whereas npm is gonna build
this giant stretching

28
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.920
tree of Node modules that contain Node
modules, that contain Node modules, right?

29
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.920
And so I think that's part
of how Yarn gets its speed.

30
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.684
And part of why it's more deterministic,
cuz everything's very, very flat.

31
00:02:04.684 --> 00:02:07.090
But, beyond that,
there's not much more to Yarn.

32
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.080
So I wouldn't worry too much
more about it than that.

33
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.190
Any more questions about Yarn?

34
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.176
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Travis is asking,
is there a common command to get started,

35
00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:19.203
like npm init?

36
00:02:19.203 --> 00:02:20.545
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think
there's a Yarn init.

37
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.366
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yarn init.

38
00:02:27.916 --> 00:02:29.842
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, yes, yes there is.

39
00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:30.991
Very similar.

40
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.535
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
Yarn has some really interesting features.

41
00:02:36.535 --> 00:02:43.617
Yarn upgrade interactive,
this stuff is just amazing to me.

42
00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:49.658
Interactive
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I need to get out of here.

43
00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:56.955
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, Genesis is like, okay,

44
00:02:56.955 --> 00:02:59.460
you have these things
that are out of date.

45
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.930
These can be upgraded to these
different things, right?

46
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.140
This is just fantastic, right?

47
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.120
There's amazing things that Yarn can do,
and

48
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.630
I'm just kinda scratching
the surface here.

49
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.957
It says, hey you know what?

50
00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:14.148
You actually have an axios 15.2,

51
00:03:14.148 --> 00:03:18.950
but there's actually 15.3 out there if
you're interested in grabbing that.

52
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.999
And you just say, you know what?

53
00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.709
I would like 15.3.

54
00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:28.389
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What do I do?

55
00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.493
I hit space, and then I hit Enter, yep.

56
00:03:30.493 --> 00:03:34.031
And just like that, it just does it.

57
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:35.467
And now we have 15.3.

58
00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:42.125
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, any other questions?

59
00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:45.423
I definitely invite you
to explore on Yarn.

60
00:03:45.423 --> 00:03:47.096
They're adding cool stuff all the time.

61
00:03:48.915 --> 00:03:51.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, we're gonna do
some global installs real quick.

62
00:03:54.777 --> 00:03:56.819
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll just
tackle those as we get them.

63
00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Question from Richard.

64
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.506
Why in your package.js is
there a Preact library too?

65
00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:09.843
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH] So,
late night hacking last night.

66
00:04:09.843 --> 00:04:10.901
I was like,
you know what would be really cool?

67
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:15.109
If I could just change my entire workshop
over to be Preact, just like that.

68
00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.160
And so I tried last night at one in
the morning or something like that.

69
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.290
And it worked, and so
I'm gonna teach it to you tomorrow.

70
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.474
So we're gonna migrate our
entire app to use Preact,

71
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:29.944
which I will talk about tomorrow why
you would even think about doing that.

72
00:04:29.944 --> 00:04:31.070
That's a good question, though.

73
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: People
snooping in the package.

74
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.935
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I know I can't
keep anything from you people.

75
00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:38.301
&gt;&gt; All: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: There are no secrets.

76
00:04:38.301 --> 00:04:39.152
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There are no secrets here.

77
00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:40.414
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: They will be discovered.

78
00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:42.636
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's true.

79
00:04:42.636 --> 00:04:46.330
That's good, though,
I like that kind of investigation.
