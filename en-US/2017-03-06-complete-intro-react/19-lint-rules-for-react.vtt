1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.502
&gt;&gt; Brian: We broke our Lint in the process
cuz Standard doesn't actually know how to

2
00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:05.778
lint React.

3
00:00:05.778 --> 00:00:10.541
I mean it can but, the real issue
is that we actually have additional

4
00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:14.731
things we wanna enforce from
our linter for React, right?

5
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:18.173
Like there's particularly things that make
Writing React better if you do them that

6
00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:20.370
way, if we want our
linter to enforce that.

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.550
So we wanna include lint rules for that.

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.800
Unfortunately, we have this issue that I
was explaining it as a benefit earlier,

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.530
that standard is not configurable.

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.840
Not even to add more things to it.

11
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.213
So at the point that you wanna do
anything to subtract or add to standard,

12
00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:39.529
you actually have to stop
using the standard package.

13
00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:42.220
You have to use EsLint and
include the standard rules.

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.200
So it is what it is but,
it's actually not too bad to do.

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.344
So first thing, create a new file,

16
00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:56.316
call it,
this is going to be inside of the,

17
00:00:56.316 --> 00:01:01.016
complete-intro-to-react folder,

18
00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:05.591
it's been called .eslintrc.json.

19
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:09.839
The reason why they put .json there is I
think you can configure it with YAML now,

20
00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:11.165
if anyone's into that.

21
00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.615
I am not, so I do not, so

22
00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:18.827
save that.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yes it begins with the dot,

23
00:01:18.827 --> 00:01:23.385
I donâ€™t give a shit.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Sorry I just

24
00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:26.186
argue with my editor all day.

25
00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:32.833
[LAUGH] Okay, so
the JSON file "extends": and

26
00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:36.662
that's gonna be an array.

27
00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:39.358
And the first thing we're going
to include is standard, right?

28
00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:43.463
So this is saying, please give me
everything from the standard rules and

29
00:01:43.463 --> 00:01:46.308
also, I want everything
from standard-react.

30
00:01:46.308 --> 00:01:52.494
Standard-react just from the same people,
it's a bunch of standard rules for

31
00:01:52.494 --> 00:01:57.940
react that are just sane default rules for
linting reacts.

32
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.590
So a plus definitely should always,
even if you don't want to use,

33
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.400
necessarily, Standard.

34
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.306
Standard React is like pretty
much required for writing React,

35
00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:12.250
in my opinion.
&gt;&gt; Brian: There's

36
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.659
nothing controversial about
standard React, unlike standard.

37
00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.072
I'll put it that way.

38
00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:20.068
So now we wanna be able to fix our lenter,
right?

39
00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:23.392
Because now it can't
just run using standard,

40
00:02:23.392 --> 00:02:28.320
that won't work anymore, so
we need it to run via eslint directly.

41
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.399
So what we're going to do is we're
going to go to our package.json,

42
00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:37.490
we're going to change
"lint" to be "eslint",

43
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.550
because that's what we're
actually going to run directly.

44
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.716
It's automatically going to read from our
&gt;&gt; Brian: From

45
00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:52.287
our eslint config, so
now we just have to tell it where to run.

46
00:02:52.287 --> 00:02:58.507
So we're gonna tell it
to run in js/**/*.js.

47
00:02:58.507 --> 00:03:01.985
This is just telling eslint,
go into the JS directory and

48
00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:04.750
then lint everything in that folder.

49
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.200
That ends in .js and
also go recursively deep, right.

50
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.550
So it's going to go down your
entire directory tree inside of js.

51
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.320
If you don't put the star star there
it'll only do the first level,

52
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.583
it won't go recursively deep, right?

53
00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:24.610
And then we also want to
lint our Webpack config,

54
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.874
so just do webpack.config.js.

55
00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:39.630
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now you might be thinking I did
not actually MPM install globally eslint.

56
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.433
However this actually still works,
because what MPM is going to do is,

57
00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:47.328
first going to check for a global install.

58
00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:48.821
No I don't think that's true,

59
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:52.580
I think it first checks if node modules
has any package called ES lint.

60
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.530
It uses that one, and then if it doesn't
find that, then it looks globally, right.

61
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.110
So this still works,
despite the fact that you don't actually

62
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.200
have ES Lent actually installed,
globally that is.

63
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.646
Right, so now I can say npm run lint, and

64
00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:16.686
it's going to crash, it's cuz a bunch

65
00:04:16.686 --> 00:04:23.760
of stuff here.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So new line required,

66
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.827
okay prop validations, haven't talked
about that, so let's ignore that for now.

67
00:04:28.827 --> 00:04:32.820
And actually you can just ignore
everything from my title and

68
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.922
then delete it.

69
00:04:33.922 --> 00:04:36.511
In fact, let's just do that,
because that's just gonna give me

70
00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:39.277
a bunch of Lint errors.
&gt;&gt; Kent: Just a hint, I think,

71
00:04:39.277 --> 00:04:41.566
if you put the -s on the end,

72
00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:46.539
I think it will not give you that
blast of npm errors, I think.

73
00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.124
That's one of the things that Kent C Dodds

74
00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:56.730
suggested.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Love Kent, he's a good dude.

75
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.840
Also from Utah, yeah that is good.

76
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.850
So yeah,
if you just include MPM run lint-s,

77
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.730
you lose all the MPM output,
which is good.

78
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.590
All right, so
I'm going to just remove js/MyTitle,

79
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.460
because we don't need it anymore.

80
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.170
And I'm going to run that again.

81
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.990
New line required, but
I can't be bothered to do it, so

82
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.520
I'm going to do npm run lint dash,
dash, dash, dash fix, right?

83
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.020
Because remember, you can pass that dash,
dash fix into ES lint.

84
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.912
And now, if I run it without it,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Everything

85
00:05:38.912 --> 00:05:44.737
works okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Any questions

86
00:05:44.737 --> 00:05:54.703
about making Lint work?
&gt;&gt; Brian: Awesome.

87
00:05:54.703 --> 00:05:56.454
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So question about using if

88
00:05:56.454 --> 00:06:00.114
you have both JSX and JS files
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

89
00:06:00.114 --> 00:06:04.642
then you just have to do both
globing patterns, globbing patterns,

90
00:06:04.642 --> 00:06:07.496
rather.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So

91
00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:12.037
you just come in here,
&gt;&gt; Brian: And do this.

92
00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:13.907
There might be a better way to do it, but

93
00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:16.418
this is an easier way to do it.
&gt;&gt; Kent: That way

94
00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.910
works.
&gt;&gt; Kent: That way works.

95
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.100
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah this way works, exactly.

96
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.550
Yeah, you can probably do like
a fancy regx, if you want to,

97
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.580
but I don't know who wants to do regx,
that seems like a bad thing to want to do.

98
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.314
So don't or do, I don't care.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
