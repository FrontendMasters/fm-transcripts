00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I'm gonna show
you one more trick to do with JSX.

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.680
So if you go to Search.

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.260
It's kind of annoying to say this dot
props dot show dot blah a bunch of

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.870
different times.

5
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.440
It's really nice if you can shorten that.

6
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.651
So, there is a trick with JSX.

7
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:20.947
I can delete this show thing, okay?

8
00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:23.572
And then I say dot dot dot right there.

9
00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:26.638
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This looks like and

10
00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:30.324
acts very similar to
the spread operator from ES6.

11
00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:34.148
Make no mistake, this is specific to ES6.

12
00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:38.750
Or sorry this is specific to JSX,
but it's meant to mimic that idea.

13
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.446
And this is basically saying I want
you to take all of the properties

14
00:00:42.446 --> 00:00:46.809
that are in show and spread them out as
if I had declared each one individually.

15
00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.687
Or in other words,
this would be the same as saying

16
00:00:51.687 --> 00:00:58.323
poster={show.poster}, title={show.title},
right?

17
00:00:58.323 --> 00:01:00.511
And going out and
saying each one of those individually.

18
00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:05.479
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You may not
always want to do that.

19
00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.281
I usually argue that explicit is better,
so if you want all those things,

20
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:13.701
it's sometimes better to go out and
list those out.

21
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:20.361
But for the sake of just showing you how
to do it, we gonna go with this, ...show.

22
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:24.556
I would say this is most akin to the
object spread operator, which is not yet

23
00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:25.834
a part of JavaScript.

24
00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:32.472
I believe that landed with ES8,
ES 2017, yes 2017.

25
00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:37.373
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's that.

26
00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:38.521
Save that.

27
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:40.825
Now come back to ShowCard.

28
00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:44.167
So now is not this.props.show.poster.

29
00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:47.689
Now it's this, this.props.poster, right?

30
00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.300
We cut out the show part of it.

31
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.260
So what we need to do here, this isn't
this.props.show that we're pulling out of.

32
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.550
It's just this.props, right?

33
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.600
So, drop the show part.

34
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.918
And this is no longer a shape, right?

35
00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:04.050
This is just those.

36
00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:09.144
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,
just straight on the prop types.

37
00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:18.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, why is this better?

38
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.320
I would say typically this is
kind of a better way to do it.

39
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.950
Because let's imagine you have another
entirely different part of your app that

40
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.220
you also want to use the show-card.

41
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.370
If you don't have the show
objects all ready premade for

42
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.690
you, you have to kind of
simulate creating them, right?

43
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.340
So you have to create an object
that has a show object and

44
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.330
then you put all those
things inside of it.

45
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.880
It's kind of a pain in the butt.

46
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.610
It's better if you just have this
explicit, simple API that's like, okay,

47
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.280
you've got a poster, title,
year, description and

48
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.190
it just knows how to display it.

49
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.589
So, I would say less nesting is almost
always better when it comes to propTypes.

50
00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:00.324
That's a Brian Hault opinion, but
I feel like that's pretty uncontroversial.

51
00:03:01.887 --> 00:03:03.165
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have plenty
of controversial ones.

52
00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:07.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
any questions about that?

53
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.640
This should still work now.

54
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.952
So, if you come back over here, refresh.

55
00:03:11.952 --> 00:03:14.686
It broke, cuz I stopped turning it.

56
00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:15.320
Mpm run dev.

57
00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.641
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
I gotta get rid of those.

58
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:28.023
So get rid of Boolean and shape.

59
00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:37.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Refresh.

60
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.763
Okay, so that all works again,
and we unexpected account.

61
00:03:43.763 --> 00:03:45.372
Yeah, I fixed that, so cool.

62
00:03:45.372 --> 00:03:48.176
Everything's passing lint,
and everyone's happy.

63
00:03:51.374 --> 00:03:52.236
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And.

64
00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:01.951
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question, Jacob's
asking how can I set a default value?

65
00:04:03.862 --> 00:04:05.553
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Default value for props?

66
00:04:07.008 --> 00:04:09.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I believe there's
a method called getDefaultProps.

67
00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:14.193
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I never use it, so.

68
00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:18.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm pretty
sure it can be done.

69
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.895
I just don't typically think that's,
I think if you're using

70
00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:27.734
getDefaultProps in all of the place,
you're probably doing it wrong.

71
00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:30.505
If that doesn't make sense
that you're doing it wrong,

72
00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:32.763
we're gonna go over
state here momentarily.

73
00:04:32.763 --> 00:04:37.614
And so, if props versus state doesn't make
sense after that, re-ask the question.
