WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.460
&gt;&gt; Brian: Thus far has pretty much just
been like a hack around intro to React.

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.547
That's just kinda showing you
the different use cases and

3
00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:14.896
kinda like the basic gist of like what
React is and kinda building some toys.

4
00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:19.296
What we're gonna do now is we're
actually going to, together,

5
00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:24.577
build an app over the next couple, lots
of hours until the end of our workshop.

6
00:00:24.577 --> 00:00:28.610
And we're just gonna build like
a very basic Netflix experience.

7
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.885
Little did you know, this is actually
just a 16 hour advertisement for Netflix,

8
00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:33.628
jokes on you.

9
00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:37.687
[LAUGH]
But yeah,

10
00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:39.280
we're just gonna build
like a really basic app.

11
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.425
It's gonna have a router.

12
00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:44.987
It's gonna have couple different pages,
it's gonna do Ajax request,

13
00:00:44.987 --> 00:00:49.645
we're gonna over some pretty common
use cases for what your app might do.

14
00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:56.138
And then you can take out pieces, put
pieces back in whatever your app requires.

15
00:00:56.138 --> 00:01:00.581
And I think that's one of the cool parts
about React as opposed to something maybe

16
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:03.520
more complete like Ember
like once you're in Ember,

17
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.345
like I have only awesome
things to say about Ember.

18
00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:10.189
It's a great framework that does a lot of
amazing things and especially if you're

19
00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.921
drawing within the lines Ember, like if
you are within the happy path of Ember,

20
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.560
you can write Ember way faster
than you can write React.

21
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.662
Like no doubt in my mind you
can do more with less code.

22
00:01:22.662 --> 00:01:24.764
What I kind of tend more towards React is,

23
00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:27.178
I often want to draw outside the lines,
right?

24
00:01:27.178 --> 00:01:31.490
I want to do different crazy things,
and I wanna do things my way.

25
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.884
And I wanna switch this module up,
for this other module, right?

26
00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:38.167
Like that kind of flexibility to do
with what's good with my app and

27
00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:42.400
React is definitely more
towards that kind of mindset.

28
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.900
And so I dare say, it's kind of,
it has maybe a higher barrier to entry.

29
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.550
I don't know if I would say higher
barrier to entry, but configuring React

30
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.110
is gonna be a lot more difficult than
something like Ember which is gonna be

31
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.169
pretty out of the box, especially
with EmberCLI which is fantastic.

32
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.050
So, I say all this to
say that I'm going to

33
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.933
introduce you to a bunch of
different modules as we go through.

34
00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:10.706
Like React Router, Redux, Redux Thunk,
all these different libraries that I'm

35
00:02:10.706 --> 00:02:16.161
going to give a lot of emphasis that this
is just one way to build an app, right?

36
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:20.120
This is a pretty good way,
I'm gonna assert it's a pretty common way.

37
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.550
But if you don't like some piece of this,

38
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.040
like say you're not a big
fan of react router, right.

39
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.627
You can swap that out for
director, and that's totally fine.

40
00:02:27.627 --> 00:02:31.730
Like React kind of lends itself
to that sort of swapping and

41
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.170
plugging this module, and taking this
module out and putting this other one in.

42
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.920
Whereas, Ember's kind of more like, here
is your entire framework, now go forth and

43
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.820
make something really, really cool.

44
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.000
So they're just different methodologies,
they're different trains of thought, and

45
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.770
I assert that they're both very valid
ways to think about solving problems.

46
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.447
Okay, so let me make sure I
just touch on everything I

47
00:02:58.447 --> 00:03:03.031
want to.
&gt;&gt; Brian: One thing is I have

48
00:03:03.031 --> 00:03:07.568
predone all of your CSS, because who
the hell wants to write CSS, not this guy.

49
00:03:07.568 --> 00:03:13.128
[LAUGH] It's just not something I
enjoy a lot, so, if you just follow

50
00:03:13.128 --> 00:03:18.600
my naming conventions, and the structure
of my markup all the style comes for free.

51
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.300
But that being said here, I'd like to just
drop that there are cool things out there,

52
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.330
like Radium and Aphrodite.

53
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.310
There's libraries for
doing your CSS in JavaScript,

54
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.770
and kind of melding that together with
React so you have everything all together.

55
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.520
In one place,

56
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.450
we're not gonna do that today because I
don't really wanna touch on styling today,

57
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.160
that something that you can definitely
go and explore on your own time.

58
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.430
We're gonna do some CSS imports
which is kinda of a cool thing, and

59
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.470
there is some really really cool things
that you can do with this, actually let's

60
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.480
go ahead it first and then I'll kind of
explain to you why I think this is cool.

61
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.177
So go back to Webpack config real quick.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Also I

62
00:04:03.177 --> 00:04:06.117
just wanted to mention I believe yeah,
we are on v2-4,

63
00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:10.959
if you need to catch up on branch.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so

64
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.959
we have these rules right here
in our webpack.config and

65
00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.057
what we're gonna do now is
we're gonna add another rule.

66
00:04:19.057 --> 00:04:23.000
And doesn't really matter which order cuz
in this particular case it doesn't matter

67
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.550
which order they run in.

68
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.747
So I'm just gonna put it after,
put another object, and

69
00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:34.129
we're gonna say hey,
&gt;&gt; Brian: I'm

70
00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:39.068
gonna say test.
&gt;&gt; Brian: And if it says,

71
00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:44.127
if you see a .css path, then your going
to use something called the style loader

72
00:04:53.007 --> 00:04:54.417
&gt;&gt; Brian: And say use,

73
00:04:57.444 --> 00:04:59.726
&gt;&gt; Brian: So what we're gonna do here is,

74
00:04:59.726 --> 00:05:03.890
if it passes CSS,
we want you to use all of these loaders.

75
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.710
So you can actually pass
multiple build steps in here,

76
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.840
that's something you need to do.

77
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.370
In this particular case we do.

78
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.948
We need to use both the style loader,
and we need to use the CSS loader.

79
00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:18.254
But let's say we're using les or
sass or something like that.

80
00:05:18.254 --> 00:05:20.751
You can also have that
build step around here too.

81
00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:22.680
I just didn't because I didn't want to.

82
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.459
So first I'm gonna say, first thing you
do is you're gonna run style loader.

83
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:33.892
Then after style-loader, you're gonna run
another loader but I need to pass in some

84
00:05:33.892 --> 00:05:37.476
configs, so I have to give it a whole
object instead of just a string.

85
00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:43.060
And the loader is going to be
called css-loader and then options,

86
00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:49.291
&gt;&gt; Brian: And url: false.

87
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:52.527
Okay so does that make sense why I need
to pass an object here because I want

88
00:05:52.527 --> 00:05:53.540
to config?

89
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.390
Style loader needs no configuration
it just works as default so

90
00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.520
I'm just gonna include that one, but the
second one I need to put this URL false

91
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.150
configuration in, so let's chitchat
a second about style verses CSS loader.

92
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.285
I'm probably going to be mixing these up
just a tiny bit because often it If you're

93
00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:13.012
gonna include the CSS letter,

94
00:06:13.012 --> 00:06:16.280
you have to include the style
loader that's just a given.

95
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.248
And I believe style loader is actually
what's going to inject your styles into

96
00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:21.641
your bundle.js, right?

97
00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:24.517
So we're gonna have our
separate CSS file and

98
00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.854
we're going to bundle our
CSS into our bundle.js.

99
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.940
And so, we're not actually going to
include any css files whatsoever, and

100
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.010
it's all going to come with bundle.

101
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.400
Now, someone might get uncomfortable
with that for good reasons,

102
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.810
because then you have to wait for

103
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.670
your JavaScript to load before your
styles load, typically not a good idea.

104
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.160
But this is a workshop, so
who gives a shit, right I don't anyway.

105
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.815
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

106
00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:51.196
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: More of a general question

107
00:06:51.196 --> 00:06:53.198
from.

108
00:06:53.198 --> 00:06:56.720
Do you use styles inside
react.js components at Netflix?

109
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.456
&gt;&gt; Brian: No we have a last set built out

110
00:06:59.456 --> 00:07:02.996
of style sheet than we include that.

111
00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:05.789
And that's just cuz that's
the way we've always done it.

112
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.168
So there are really cool things
you can do with Webpack,

113
00:07:10.168 --> 00:07:14.013
like you can actually have it build
out like, critical CSS, in line that,

114
00:07:14.013 --> 00:07:17.980
like there's a myriad of things you can
do with styles here, that are totally

115
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.375
advanced use cases, so I'm going to again
plug Ken's workshop about Webpack, I'm

116
00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:25.322
sure he covers a lot of that cool stuff.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: He does.

117
00:07:25.322 --> 00:07:25.850
&gt;&gt; Brian: Awesome.

118
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.290
And I, like I am not an expert on it.

119
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.230
That's the other thing.

120
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.205
As you can see,
writing css is not my favorite thing,

121
00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:36.855
partially because I'm not good at it and
I don't like things that I'm not good at.

122
00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:42.840
That's Brian Holt character flaw,
to my therapists our there.

123
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.415
Anyway, so css-loader,
that's what's going on here.

124
00:07:45.415 --> 00:07:50.120
css-loader actually makes it so webpack
can read CSS, that it can understand CSS,

125
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.780
that's why we need that.

126
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.294
Then the options url: false,

127
00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:57.148
this is just a really personal preference
that bugs me about the css-loader.

128
00:07:57.148 --> 00:08:00.820
If you have a path in there
to include this image,

129
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.250
It's actually gonna try and
inline that image, too into your bundle.

130
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.220
So now your images, your CSS,
and your JavaScript and

131
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.829
your markup are all bundled
into that bundle.js.

132
00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:14.672
I don't know why I draw the line at image,
but I certainly do.

133
00:08:14.672 --> 00:08:17.450
[LAUGH] So I didn't like that.

134
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.289
So that's why that url false is there.

135
00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:21.244
That just means don't inline my images.

136
00:08:21.244 --> 00:08:23.343
Dear God, don't inline them.
