00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What I want you to do is I
want you to open your editor of choice.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.262
Mine is Sublime.

3
00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:10.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I want you to create
a new file, I don't care where you save it

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.250
cuz this is not what we're
actually gonna end up doing.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.881
But I'm just gonna put mine
in my repo that's fine.

6
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.770
Or you could put it on like
your desktop or something.

7
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.690
Whatever.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.621
So I add this index.html.

9
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.870
As long as it's called an HTML file,
then that's okay.

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.166
And I want you to put
some HTML boiler plate.

11
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:40.058
I'm gonna use Emmett.

12
00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:43.489
So if you don't know what Emmett is,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Amazing.

13
00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:44.265
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Amazing.

14
00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:46.307
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That is really cool.

15
00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:51.028
Basically, it allows to do shorthands, so
I just html, colon, five and I hit tab and

16
00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:55.120
it just autocompletes out to
like a basic html document.

17
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.064
It does tons of more stuff than that but
I use that quite frequently.

18
00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:07.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we end up with the basic html document.

19
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.950
You can put whatever
title you want in there.

20
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.012
I'm gonna put Masters React.

21
00:01:22.017 --> 00:01:22.716
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

22
00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:29.768
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now what we're
going to do is we're going to

23
00:01:29.768 --> 00:01:33.477
put a div on the page with id="app".

24
00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is where
React is going to mount itself.

25
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.889
You have to have a div, or
something where react can mount itself.

26
00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:48.568
So we're gonna put it here
inside of this app div,

27
00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:53.670
you can put some text here as like
react has not yet rendered, right.

28
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.212
Cuz that text will exist
until a react replaces it.

29
00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:04.884
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and now we're gonna
need two scripts to get React up and

30
00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:05.544
running.

31
00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:08.729
So we're gonna say script

32
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.390
src=*node_modules/react/ dist/react.js,

33
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.030
so we need the react library, right?

34
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.537
And then, I'm gonna copy that and

35
00:02:24.537 --> 00:02:28.691
I'm also gonna bring in
react-dom in the same fashion.

36
00:02:33.438 --> 00:02:38.552
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so node_modules/react
and you also need node_modules/react-dom.

37
00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:47.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's talk about why we
need two libraries instead of just one.

38
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.889
It used to be up until 0.8,

39
00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:55.530
0.9, I don't really remember.

40
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.430
But until somewhat recently, you just
needed the React library, that was it.

41
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.216
And then some mobile developers at
Facebook got kind of jealous of people

42
00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:07.755
writing React, it's like, this is really
great, I want to keep writing React.

43
00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:10.814
And so what they did is, we're gonna write
React but for mobile development and

44
00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:13.320
they came up with React Native, right?

45
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.950
The same sort of patterns
that were going on, but

46
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.030
they wrote that to target iOS and Android.

47
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.630
And so at that point React realized that
they had an entire paradigm of coding.

48
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.570
And what they decided to do is they
decided to split out React which is just

49
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.320
the library for expressing UIs,
independent of their target.

50
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.070
So that you can target Android
browsers,VR, all these different sorts of

51
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.280
environments and then they created these
kind of separately which is the renderer.

52
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.401
Which would be like react-dom,
react-native, a frame react, react three.

53
00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:55.580
There's dozens of these
renderers out there.

54
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.040
So that's what react dom is for
our use case today,

55
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.290
all we're going to be using is react dom.

56
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.630
But that's just the glue layer between,

57
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.700
I write my interface in react,
I have the browser, right?

58
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.972
And I need the glue in the middle,
that's what react dom is.

59
00:04:11.523 --> 00:04:15.851
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
that's why you need both of those.

60
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:18.665
And then now, after I load these two,
I'm going to have a script tag,

61
00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:20.970
I'm just going to write
JavaScript straight in my HTML.

62
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.120
Cuz I do what I want okay.

63
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.121
So I'm going to say,

64
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:38.719
var MyFirstComponent = React.createClass.

65
00:04:42.813 --> 00:04:45.044
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'm going to give it a render function.

66
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.794
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay and
then here I'm going to return.

67
00:04:58.504 --> 00:05:00.555
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm gonna put these parentheses here.

68
00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:06.245
That's just a JavaScript thing that lets
you kind of continue your return statement

69
00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:10.698
onto a second line.q And the reason why I
do that is so I can make my code look like

70
00:05:10.698 --> 00:05:14.059
mark up, so let's finish that and
then I'll explain why I do it.

71
00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:17.433
But, suffice to say you have
to have these parentheses, so

72
00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:21.830
just trust me for a moment and I'll
explain in a sec why you need those, okay?

73
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.570
So I'm going to do React.DOM.div.

74
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.607
Which is just a function.

75
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Null I'll explain
that here in just a sec as well.

76
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.746
Come on.

77
00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:48.023
And then React.dom.h1(null).

78
00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:53.434
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is my first component.

79
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.979
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
that is your first React component.

80
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.240
Nothing too crazy going on here, right?

81
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.454
So we made a div that has an h1 inside of
it, that says, this is my first component.

82
00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:20.450
That's the entirety of
what has happened here.

83
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.690
Now what's the null?

84
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.550
The null is the attributes that you're
passing to that dom element, right?

85
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.640
So if you wanted to give it
like a class name or an id.

86
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.634
That's where you would do it.

87
00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:33.100
Since we are not passing any
attributes to it, we just pass it null.

88
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.152
You can give an empty object,
that would be fine too.

89
00:06:37.175 --> 00:06:39.583
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then the second
thing is what goes inside of it, right?

90
00:06:39.583 --> 00:06:44.420
So notice here, I have comma, and
then I have another DOM element.

91
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.428
And then this one,
I'm just giving it a text element.

92
00:06:47.428 --> 00:06:48.280
That make sense?
