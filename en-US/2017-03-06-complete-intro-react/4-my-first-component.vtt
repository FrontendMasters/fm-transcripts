00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What I want you to do is I
want you to open your editor of choice.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.710
Mine is Sublime.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.348
I want you to create a new file,
I don't care where you

4
00:00:10.348 --> 00:00:14.250
save it cuz this is not what we're
actually gonna end up doing.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.881
But I'm just gonna put mine
in my repo that's fine.

6
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.770
Or you could put it on like
your desktop or something.

7
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.690
Whatever.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.621
So I add this index.html.

9
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.870
As long as it's called an HTML file,
then that's okay.

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.166
And I want you to put
some HTML boiler plate.

11
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:40.058
I'm gonna use Emmett.

12
00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:43.489
So if you don't know what Emmett is,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Amazing.

13
00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:44.265
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Amazing.

14
00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:46.307
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That is really cool.

15
00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:51.028
Basically, it allows to do shorthands, so
I just html, colon, five and I hit tab and

16
00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:55.120
it just autocompletes out to
like a basic html document.

17
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.328
It does tons of more stuff than that but

18
00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:05.210
I use that quite frequently.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

19
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.170
we end up with the basic html document.

20
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.950
You can put whatever
title you want in there.

21
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.012
I'm gonna put Masters React.

22
00:01:22.017 --> 00:01:22.716
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

23
00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:27.862
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now what we're going to

24
00:01:27.862 --> 00:01:32.008
do is we're going to put
a div on the page with

25
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:38.530
id="app".
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

26
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.480
this is where React is
going to mount itself.

27
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.889
You have to have a div, or
something where react can mount itself.

28
00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:48.568
So we're gonna put it here
inside of this app div,

29
00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:53.670
you can put some text here as like
react has not yet rendered, right.

30
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.212
Cuz that text will exist
until a react replaces it.

31
00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:01.745
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and

32
00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:05.544
now we're gonna need two scripts
to get React up and running.

33
00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:08.729
So we're gonna say script

34
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.390
src=*node_modules/react/ dist/react.js,

35
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.030
so we need the react library, right?

36
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.304
And then, I'm gonna copy that and
I'm also gonna bring in react-dom in

37
00:02:27.304 --> 00:02:33.882
the same fashion.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

38
00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:35.734
so node_modules/react and

39
00:02:35.734 --> 00:02:43.512
you also need node_modules/react-dom.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

40
00:02:43.512 --> 00:02:47.160
let's talk about why we need two
libraries instead of just one.

41
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.889
It used to be up until 0.8,

42
00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:55.530
0.9, I don't really remember.

43
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.430
But until somewhat recently, you just
needed the React library, that was it.

44
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.216
And then some mobile developers at
Facebook got kind of jealous of people

45
00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:07.755
writing React, it's like, this is really
great, I want to keep writing React.

46
00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:10.814
And so what they did is, we're gonna write
React but for mobile development and

47
00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:13.320
they came up with React Native, right?

48
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.950
The same sort of patterns
that were going on, but

49
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.030
they wrote that to target iOS and Android.

50
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.630
And so at that point React realized that
they had an entire paradigm of coding.

51
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.570
And what they decided to do is they
decided to split out React which is just

52
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.320
the library for expressing UIs,
independent of their target.

53
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.070
So that you can target Android
browsers,VR, all these different sorts of

54
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.280
environments and then they created these
kind of separately which is the renderer.

55
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.401
Which would be like react-dom,
react-native, a frame react, react three.

56
00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:55.580
There's dozens of these
renderers out there.

57
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.040
So that's what react dom is for
our use case today,

58
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.290
all we're going to be using is react dom.

59
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.630
But that's just the glue layer between,

60
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.700
I write my interface in react,
I have the browser, right?

61
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.944
And I need the glue in the middle,

62
00:04:07.944 --> 00:04:12.432
that's what react dom is.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

63
00:04:12.432 --> 00:04:15.851
that's why you need both of those.

64
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:18.665
And then now, after I load these two,
I'm going to have a script tag,

65
00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:20.970
I'm just going to write
JavaScript straight in my HTML.

66
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.120
Cuz I do what I want okay.

67
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.121
So I'm going to say,

68
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:34.522
var MyFirstComponent =

69
00:04:34.522 --> 00:04:42.993
React.createClass.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

70
00:04:42.993 --> 00:04:52.368
I'm going to give it a render function.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay and

71
00:04:52.368 --> 00:04:58.617
then here I'm going to return.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

72
00:04:58.617 --> 00:05:00.555
I'm gonna put these parentheses here.

73
00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:06.245
That's just a JavaScript thing that lets
you kind of continue your return statement

74
00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:10.698
onto a second line.q And the reason why I
do that is so I can make my code look like

75
00:05:10.698 --> 00:05:14.059
mark up, so let's finish that and
then I'll explain why I do it.

76
00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:17.433
But, suffice to say you have
to have these parentheses, so

77
00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:21.830
just trust me for a moment and I'll
explain in a sec why you need those, okay?

78
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.570
So I'm going to do React.DOM.div.

79
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.032
Which is just a function.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Null I'll

80
00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:37.520
explain that here in just a sec as well.

81
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.746
Come on.

82
00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:48.023
And then React.dom.h1(null).

83
00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:53.434
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is my first component.

84
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.869
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and

85
00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:05.979
that is your first React component.

86
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.240
Nothing too crazy going on here, right?

87
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.454
So we made a div that has an h1 inside of
it, that says, this is my first component.

88
00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:20.450
That's the entirety of
what has happened here.

89
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.690
Now what's the null?

90
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.550
The null is the attributes that you're
passing to that dom element, right?

91
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.640
So if you wanted to give it
like a class name or an id.

92
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.634
That's where you would do it.

93
00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:33.100
Since we are not passing any
attributes to it, we just pass it null.

94
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.237
You can give an empty object,

95
00:06:34.237 --> 00:06:37.319
that would be fine too.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

96
00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:39.583
then the second thing is what
goes inside of it, right?

97
00:06:39.583 --> 00:06:44.420
So notice here, I have comma, and
then I have another DOM element.

98
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.428
And then this one,
I'm just giving it a text element.

99
00:06:47.428 --> 00:06:48.280
That make sense?
