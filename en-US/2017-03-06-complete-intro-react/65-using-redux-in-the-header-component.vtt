WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?
So let's go make sure that that gets

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.530
modified.

3
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.325
So let's go to header.js.

4
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:14.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're going to
import at the top, connect,

5
00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:22.724
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From react React-redux.

6
00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:24.787
And we're also going to
import our action creator.

7
00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:34.564
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: setSearchTerm
from ./actioncreators.

8
00:00:40.347 --> 00:00:41.123
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

9
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.096
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now that we have those,
we're gonna need a prop type,

10
00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:53.807
which is down here at the bottom for
dispatch.

11
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.945
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
instead of having handle set search term,

12
00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:03.945
we're gonna change that to dispatch.

13
00:01:09.957 --> 00:01:13.157
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

14
00:01:13.157 --> 00:01:17.741
then inside of handleTermChange,
which I would rather we have to add

15
00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:21.311
a method called handleTermChange
up here at the top.

16
00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:26.007
handle,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SearchTermChange.

17
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.768
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Come on.

18
00:01:35.017 --> 00:01:37.717
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you're
following along like me and doing

19
00:01:37.717 --> 00:01:42.580
this as an ES6 class, just a reminder,
slash whatever, there's no comma here.

20
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.530
Normally, if it feels like this is
JavaScript, we should put a comma there.

21
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.660
But with EX6 classes, there's no commas.

22
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They wanna
see search GIFs real quick.

23
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

24
00:02:09.832 --> 00:02:11.798
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
as soon as I finish this next little bit,

25
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.404
I'll just push up a new branch too.

26
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:27.041
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: handleSearchTermChange,

27
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:33.324
we're just gonna say, this.props.dispatch
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Our

28
00:02:33.324 --> 00:02:36.291
setSearchTerm, you can
do it in either way,

29
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:41.020
you can do just with dispatch directly,
you can do it with map.

30
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.310
Props to dispatch.

31
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.180
I'm fine with either way.

32
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.208
With event.target.value we
need the event right there.

33
00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:56.053
Okay.

34
00:02:56.053 --> 00:03:00.795
So that, handle search term

35
00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:05.071
chance
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here when we have

36
00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:10.038
the input, instead of going to
this.props.handleSearchTermChange,

37
00:03:10.038 --> 00:03:11.629
now this is local.

38
00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.320
Okay, and so we have to get rid of that.

39
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.240
So it's handleSearchTermChange
right there.

40
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.879
But now we have a problem,
cuz we're using goddamn ES6 classes.

41
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.370
What is this here?

42
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.810
Now, if this was the other way
if this was react create class,

43
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.040
we wouldn't even have to worry about this.

44
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.040
But now, because we're doing ES6 classes,

45
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.040
this is not guaranteed to be header,
right?

46
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.610
So now, we have to go back and guarantee
that's always going to be header.

47
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.345
So, we're gonna do

48
00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:56.960
constructor props super props.

49
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.891
So if you ever do a constructor
inside of class with react,

50
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:07.720
you just have to do this cuz We
get props from creating this,

51
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.600
and we have to parse those up to
react.component or everything falls apart.

52
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.800
So, that's just a mess,

53
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.270
like that should just be like
an automatic, okay I'm ES6 class.

54
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.000
React, super (props), right?

55
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.646
First line always is
gonna be super (props).

56
00:04:24.386 --> 00:04:28.916
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Super if you're coming from
a language where inheritance is common,

57
00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:31.000
should be look familiar to you.

58
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.080
But, this is basically saying please
call my parents constructor with this.

59
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.220
That's what that does.

60
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.522
Now, that we've done that we can
say this.handleSearchTermChange =

61
00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:45.353
this.handleSearchTermChange.bindthis.

62
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is just making
sure that header is this right there.

63
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.835
We need to assure ourselves
that that is always the case.

64
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:13.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's annoying.

65
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.130
So again, this right here is the reason
why I don't like the syntax as much.

66
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.860
Certainly for teaching, cuz it's
just a boiler plate feeling to me,

67
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.830
and I hate writing boiling plate, yeah.

68
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, again, is asking
isn't it harder to do change if you've

69
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.129
put the connect in all the elements?

70
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.010
Isn't it better having to connect
in only the container and

71
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.590
pass the props down in the component?

72
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.590
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a design decision.

73
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.680
This is certainly just
an easier way to teach.

74
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.450
And I think this is a perfectly
acceptable way to do it.

75
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.530
So, I think what's being asked is,
where do you put connect?

76
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.680
You can put connect in
one of several places.

77
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.820
You can do it in the parent container,
you can do it in the lower container.

78
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.250
I prefer for only header is worried about
search term in this particular case.

79
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.490
So, why don't we make header
read directly from redux?

80
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.353
But you could make search from redux,
and then pass that down into header.

81
00:06:16.353 --> 00:06:17.450
Up to you.

82
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.804
This is just the way that I would
have personally done it myself.

83
00:06:26.462 --> 00:06:30.293
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, we need to
finish doing this down here, so.

84
00:06:30.293 --> 00:06:35.962
const mapStateToProps

85
00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:41.348
= (state) return,

86
00:06:41.348 --> 00:06:50.142
searchTerm: state.searchTerm.

87
00:06:50.142 --> 00:06:55.164
And then you would connect
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Map

88
00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:59.280
state the header or
map state to props around header.

89
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.673
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, let's go ahead and
see if that works now, real quick.

90
00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:18.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Refresh.

91
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.620
So, nothing shows up cuz I still have
something random as my default state.

92
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.895
But if I delete,
it's now starting to read from

93
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.276
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From Redux, so

94
00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:37.253
now everything is working with Redux.

95
00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:44.171
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now interesting, cool side
benefit about this, so now I type House,

96
00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:46.550
I click on House of Cards, okay?

97
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.780
So, I go into the House of Cards route.

98
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.170
Now if I hit back,
I still have house written here, right,

99
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.500
because redux is not temporal, right,

100
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.470
it's living across all of these different
route source state as preserved.

101
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.770
If this was pre, like react like it
previously was, it would have been removed

102
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.430
because that component went out of scope,
so its state would have gone away with it.

103
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.700
Same thing if we go to the home page.

104
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.790
It still says house right there.

105
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.060
Now, that may or
may not be desirable for you but

106
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.580
that state is living across routes
because redux is not being reloaded.

107
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.020
I'm gonna go change my
default state to be blank.

108
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.800
A question.

109
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.598
Push your branch?.

110
00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:34.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One question.

111
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.790
What is the best jumpstart for migrating
from an existing ES five app into react?.

112
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:50.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the nice thing about
react is, you can migrate piecemeal.

113
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.667
So, you can just start with
the least of your app,

114
00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:58.237
right, kind of the terminal points.

115
00:08:58.237 --> 00:09:01.840
You can have just one page,
right, that's a React app.

116
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.690
And also the Angular app lives
on the other side, right.

117
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.650
React doesn't have to own your entire
app like Angular, or Ember does.

118
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.250
It's fine being just a piece of it,

119
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.770
and then slowly you can just kinda start
replacing different pieces with React.

120
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.818
And then, bigger pieces of React,

121
00:09:17.818 --> 00:09:20.974
until eventually it kinda
takes over your entire app.

122
00:09:20.974 --> 00:09:22.310
And that's definitely
the way I would suggest it.

123
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.870
As much as possible,
one can marry Angular and React together,

124
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.030
and I highly suggest not doing that.

125
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.690
I'd say backbone is as far as I would go.

126
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.810
Like marrying backbone and React, and
I wouldn't go any further than that.

127
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.720
Any other questions?

128
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.260
There is one.

129
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.817
I'm trying to figure it out, though.

130
00:09:42.817 --> 00:09:43.924
Okay.

131
00:09:43.924 --> 00:09:47.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The browse all link
now needs to clear the state.

132
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.530
If you click it when something is in the
form field, the result still be filtered?

133
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, that's true.

134
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.170
So you would just dispatch an action with
an empty string is how I would do that.

135
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.985
I'm not gonna fix it right now,
but you could totally fix that.

136
00:10:10.884 --> 00:10:12.266
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Richard is saying,

137
00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:18.360
you can use the syntax Which is the arrow
syntax for handle set search term.

138
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.560
So, you don't have to use the constructor
and it's cleaner syntax too.

139
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.580
And if you don't use a constructor you
can define state as an object inside

140
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.280
the component.

141
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.630
You may want to look up a chat.

142
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.450
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah I mean I That
there are ways to get around with

143
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.390
the way I did it.

144
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.432
Again, this is a class property,
which is not standard JavaScript yet,

145
00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:43.534
which is why I don't teach it.

146
00:10:43.534 --> 00:10:45.870
If you're comfortable with it,
cuz eventually it will land.

147
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.390
I think it's a stage three prop or
stage four,

148
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.320
borrowing from the terminology from TC39,
the JavaScript standardization body.

149
00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.694
There are ways around it, but until those
land as officially part of JavaScript,

150
00:11:02.694 --> 00:11:04.249
I'm not gonna teach them.

151
00:11:10.907 --> 00:11:16.174
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So,

152
00:11:16.174 --> 00:11:19.249
I just pushed the v2-20
