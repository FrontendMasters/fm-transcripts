00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.010
&gt;&gt; Brian: Something that you can do that
makes things a little bit nicer looking is

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.240
you can say, var MyTitleFact or factory,

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:18.781
whatever you wanna say,
equals React.createfactory, crete,

4
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:25.250
createfactory with MyTitle,

5
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.400
which basically makes this MyTitleFactory
method the same as this div one right.

6
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.032
So, I can actually just go in and
replace all of these, let's see.

7
00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:42.606
&gt;&gt; Brian: With MyTitleFactory now.

8
00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:43.961
And it looks a little bit nicer.

9
00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:51.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Please repeat
again what that does.

10
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.200
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, so
we have this like, div method,

11
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.160
which is just like
a convenience helper method.

12
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

13
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.499
&gt;&gt; Brian: Instead of having to do
a React.create element div, right?

14
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.460
We have this nice div helper method.

15
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.570
So, what this my towel
factory does is it basically

16
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.540
makes this kind of factory method for
whatever components you've created, right?

17
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.310
So, I pass my title, right, and
it gives me back a factory method, so

18
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.490
that I can call it just like this.

19
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.590
So, if you save this and rerun it,
it'll look exactly the same.

20
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.980
It's a convenience method.

21
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.280
If it works for you, use it.

22
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.732
If it doesn't, then don't.

23
00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:31.705
&gt;&gt; Brian: But I just wanted to
make you aware that it does exist.

24
00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:33.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

25
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.142
&gt;&gt; Brian: So yeah,
if I refresh, still works.

26
00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:49.547
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

27
00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:53.350
So, still not super compelling yet.

28
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.640
But let's start talking about something
that does make React compelling which

29
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.499
are props.

30
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.380
So right now, we have this "check out
this component" four times on the page.

31
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.870
That's not super useful.

32
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.245
So, let's actually start passing
in different strings that this

33
00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:16.730
MyTitle can be useful for multiple things,
it can be a little bit more flexible.

34
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.510
So, what we're gonna do is come down
to your MyTitle factories, right here.

35
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.775
And, I'm just gonna replace this null.

36
00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:30.471
We're gonna actually pass it some
attributes, and we're gonna say,

37
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:35.117
title
&gt;&gt; Brian: 'props

38
00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:38.026
are the best' I don't know.

39
00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:40.113
And you can pass in whatever
strings you want here.

40
00:02:43.452 --> 00:02:46.193
&gt;&gt; Brian: And semicolons are the worst.

41
00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:53.031
&gt;&gt; Brian: jklol,
it's okay if you like semicolons.

42
00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:01.280
&gt;&gt; Brian: And, I'm out of ideas.

43
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.780
Okay.

44
00:03:04.577 --> 00:03:07.096
&gt;&gt; Brian: So now,
I'm passing in these attributes.

45
00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:11.846
&gt;&gt; Brian: I guess I need a space,
whatever,

46
00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:14.828
it doesn't need a pass lint, not yet.

47
00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:16.937
Okay.

48
00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:20.910
So, we're passing this
object from the parent.

49
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.670
The parent being my first component
down into my title, right?

50
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.800
And now, in MyTitle it has
these properties available

51
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.410
that it can read from its parents.

52
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.780
Now, I very carefully chose the word read,

53
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.200
it can only read these properties from
its parents and it cannot modify them.

54
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.642
So, these are read only properties,
and momentarily,

55
00:03:42.642 --> 00:03:45.371
I'll get into why that's
actually important.

56
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:52.901
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and
then I'm gonna replace the string

57
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:57.660
right here, with this.props.title.

58
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.360
Okay?
This,

59
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.220
referring to this particular
element that we've created.

60
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.260
Props are the things that
my parents passed to me.

61
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.010
And then,
title is whatever I called it, right?

62
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.070
So, it just needs to match this.

63
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.030
There is no black magic.

64
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.410
It needs to say title, right?

65
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.200
I could have called this stupid prop, and

66
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.530
I would just call it stupid prop there,
right?

67
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.321
It just needs to match.

68
00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:27.050
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so now if I save,
come over here and refresh,

69
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.614
I'm gonna end up with a bunch of different
h1s instead of just the same one, right.

70
00:04:36.913 --> 00:04:37.905
&gt;&gt; Brian: Questions?

71
00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:45.510
&gt;&gt; Brian: Is anyone seeing it, no?

72
00:04:59.654 --> 00:05:01.494
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Michael's asking,

73
00:05:01.494 --> 00:05:05.990
you don't need to pass in props or
anything to your render function?

74
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.490
&gt;&gt; Brian: No.

75
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.680
So, there are several types of components,
and we will talk about those later.

76
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.770
But suffice to say, there is one
type that you do pass in props.

77
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.070
So, that is probably
what he is thinking of.

78
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.450
Okay, so this is getting slightly
cooler as we go on, right?

79
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.979
Now, we have these kind of
flexible title components.

80
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.680
So, let's take it even one step further.

81
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.774
And you're not restricted to
only passing strings down,

82
00:05:35.774 --> 00:05:40.385
you can pass down properties, you can pass
down functions, you can pass down anything

83
00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:43.817
that JavaScript knows how to
pass around by reference, right?

84
00:05:46.196 --> 00:05:49.503
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, let's actually do that.

85
00:05:49.503 --> 00:05:51.945
We're gonna give it another property
that we're gonna pass down here.

86
00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:59.580
&gt;&gt; Brian: We're gonna give it a color and

87
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.710
then just pass in whatever your
favorite named CSS color is.

88
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.110
I have several, so I will help you out.

89
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.690
Peru is my favorite CSS named color,
I don't know if you knew this but

90
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.480
peru is a color.

91
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.340
Medium aquamarine, also another color.

92
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.582
This is my favorite interview question.

93
00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:23.394
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian: Is the ask interviewees,

94
00:06:23.394 --> 00:06:25.260
what's your favorite CSS color.

95
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.560
If you don't give me a cool one,
you're not get hired.

96
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Tomato.

97
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.835
&gt;&gt; Brian: Tomato is a good one.

98
00:06:30.835 --> 00:06:31.830
Blanched almond.

99
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Wheat.

100
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Papaya whip.

101
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.390
&gt;&gt; Brian: Papaya whip,
that's always a good one.

102
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.114
I always have to give a shout out
to Eric Meyer with rebecca purple.

103
00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:47.525
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's see,
what else should we put in here?

104
00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:50.405
I think there's dark violet-red.

105
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.650
&gt;&gt; Brian: Just random colors.

106
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.480
Okay, so now we're passing in
these color strings, right?

107
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.300
But now we actually wanna
use them here on this h1.

108
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.950
So, what we're gonna do is we're
gonna give it an object, right?

109
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.949
And these are going to be properties
given to this particular h1.

110
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.880
Style in particular is
a little bit different.

111
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.240
You're gonna say style: and
then you're gonna give it an object.

112
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.590
It's not the string, right?

113
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.410
A lot of people expect you to just give it
the style string that we typically use.

114
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:30.019
But we're gonna say style, and
then color, and then this.props.color.

115
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.682
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right, so
if I wanted to add bold to this,

116
00:07:37.682 --> 00:07:43.310
you would just say,
fontweight bold, right?

117
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.050
So, that's the way that you can interact
with the style object in particular.

118
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.130
It's also the way the JavaScript API for
interacting with styles works, which

119
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.760
is actually what it's doing underneath
the hood, which is why it looks like that.

120
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.820
So, anyway, you don't need to put that,
just put the color.
