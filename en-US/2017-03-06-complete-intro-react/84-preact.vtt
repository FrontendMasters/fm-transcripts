WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so I'm gonna give you one
more suggestion on how to make this drop

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.781
even further, and
we're actually going to not include react.

3
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:13.050
What?

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.640
Okay, [INAUDIBLE] we're
gonna include preact.

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.240
So, just one last thing.

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.650
There's another library called preact
which I didn't really think was

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.500
reliable until recently but it has a lot
of traction behind it, it's written by

8
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.716
a really smart, one really smart guy and
a great community around him.

9
00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:39.028
It's a drop-in compatible
library to react,

10
00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:44.338
and it's only three
kilobytes If you gzip it and

11
00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:50.445
compress it,
whereas react ends up at about 80ish,

12
00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:53.388
gzipped and compressed.

13
00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:59.430
&gt;&gt; Brian: The caveat here is it doesn't
include everything that react includes.

14
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.190
It doesn't include propTypes,
it doesn't include React.createClass.

15
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.716
It only includes ES6 class and
&gt;&gt; Brian: Functional components,

16
00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:14.690
stateless functional components and
some other very minor differences.

17
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.300
However, they do ship what's called
the compat library, that for

18
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.510
an additional 5k, they will
support all of those features too.

19
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.800
So real quickly,
this entire app that we built with react,

20
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.190
we're going to rip it out and
put Preact in.

21
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.890
With just a little bit of Webpack magic.

22
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Before you do,

23
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.795
there's a couple of comments
about using Uglify and Webpack-b.

24
00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:41.140
You don't use Webpack-b
if you're using Uglify.

25
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.210
&gt;&gt; Brian: Is that the,
that's probably what my-

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think that's what they're

27
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.562
saying the bug was.

28
00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:50.266
&gt;&gt; Brian: Alright, so In any case,

29
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.904
we can drop that because you
are using it with dash p.

30
00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:04.170
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

31
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.510
Yeah, see we ended up with the same thing.

32
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.230
So this is ready to
ship out to production.

33
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.040
But we're gonna try and see if we can
shave off some of the additional K off of

34
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.230
that bundle using preact.

35
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.846
So I want you to go to
your webpack config.

36
00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:27.000
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
we're gonna do an additional field.

37
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.370
It's gonna be alias.

38
00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:37.331
&gt;&gt; Brian: Every time we ask for react,
we're gonna serve it preact-compat,

39
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:41.170
which is that react replacement library.

40
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.464
And every time it asks for,
we have to put this in quotes,

41
00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:50.296
'react-dom', we're also gonna
give it preact-compat and

42
00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:55.752
this library is as far as I know 100%
compatible with the react API but

43
00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:58.179
it just serves preact instead.

44
00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:03.955
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay then another thing we
need to do is preact does have to be run

45
00:03:03.955 --> 00:03:06.891
through babble so we just have to
make sure that that is happening.

46
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.020
&gt;&gt; Brian: So in this include,
I'm gonna put that in ray.

47
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.390
And we just have to
give it one more thing.

48
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.462
We have to do path.resolve.

49
00:03:26.258 --> 00:03:35.455
&gt;&gt; Brian: node_modules/preact-compat/src.

50
00:03:35.455 --> 00:03:37.210
So everything that comes from there
also must be run through Babel as well.

51
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Resolve is misspelled,
it's reslove.

52
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.990
&gt;&gt; Brian: Thank you.

53
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think you also
forgot comma after your alias.

54
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.810
&gt;&gt; Brian: I probably did.

55
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.218
I'm losing my mind.

56
00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:53.431
Thank you.

57
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:55.930
Okay, and that's it.

58
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.060
That's all you have to do.

59
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.528
This will drop in preact for you.

60
00:03:58.528 --> 00:04:02.142
So [LAUGH] let's see if
this actually works.

61
00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:05.487
&gt;&gt; Brian: Boom.

62
00:04:12.873 --> 00:04:14.248
&gt;&gt; Brian: Did I spell alias wrong, too?

63
00:04:14.248 --> 00:04:14.999
No.

64
00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.608
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Aliases.

65
00:04:17.608 --> 00:04:19.515
&gt;&gt; Brian: No, I have alias in my.

66
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.648
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now why is that

67
00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.520
&gt;&gt; Brian: This is inside of resolve, okay.

68
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.020
Yeah.

69
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.800
&gt;&gt; Brian: So inside of resolve, next to
extensions, that's where the alias goes.

70
00:05:06.884 --> 00:05:11.050
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, we drop from 218 to 96.

71
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.440
Just from switching from react to preact.

72
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.110
And supposedly, I haven't bunched
those marks up myself, but

73
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.230
I can tell you that supposedly preact
is actually faster than react.

74
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.880
So it's an interesting thing
that you should evaluate.

75
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.280
We're not using it at Netfli,x but

76
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.250
I'm gonna try and see how well it
works with our Netflix code base.

77
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.950
But let's go actually [LAUGH]
make sure that it works, right?

78
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.560
If it doesn't work then
it's not that impressive.

79
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Richard is asking
what about the ecosystem?

80
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.430
Will all the react library components
be compatible with preact?

81
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.216
&gt;&gt; Brian: Pretty close The only
thing which I purposely did not

82
00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:56.390
talk about today is it
doesn't do mix-ins at all.

83
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.560
React does have the ability to do mix-ins
that they're trying to deprecate because

84
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.030
they're awful.

85
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.012
That's why I don't even talk about them.

86
00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:08.090
But says yeah, we're not messing
with that so they don't do it.

87
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.409
But other than that, I haven't personally
seen anything that it didn't interoperate.

88
00:06:18.963 --> 00:06:22.562
&gt;&gt; Brian: The other thing is, we would
have to go fix our server to get this to

89
00:06:22.562 --> 00:06:27.460
server side render, and I'm not gonna
do that, but it's not that hard.

90
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.360
So, if you wanna get this to
run server side rendering

91
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.400
you do have to go modify your server.

92
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.349
It's not as easy as dropping in
pre- it's pretty close though.

93
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.621
&gt;&gt; Brian: So A D A, and
there you go, it still works.

94
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.953
&gt;&gt; Brian: Pretty cool, right?

95
00:06:56.713 --> 00:06:57.837
&gt;&gt; Brian: It's a, yeah.

96
00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:04.470
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yep, so there you go.

97
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.070
That's Preact.

98
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.120
There's also one called Inferno,
which is pretty closed to.

99
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.920
It's even smaller than preact and
supposedly even faster.

100
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.658
But I don't think that's
a stability of preact.

101
00:07:16.658 --> 00:07:19.790
So preact in my opinion
is valuable alternative.

102
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.985
It's something that's definitely
evaluated if youre doing react.

103
00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:25.340
Because you get to take advantage
of all the reacts ecosystems but

104
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.530
much smaller page load.

105
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.230
But I leave that up to you to decide
if that's what you want to do or not.

106
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.550
And as you see here, it's really small.

107
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.250
If we moved everything
to es6 components and

108
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.940
we started using the preact package
instead of the react package, we would

109
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:48.710
drop an additional 5K off our package,
so there's It's pretty compelling.

110
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.570
Any questions about preact?

111
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.990
I've only tooled around
with it just a little.

112
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.790
I wanted to make you aware of how
easy it is to migrate to preact.

113
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:04.581
They do an awesome job, so thanks preact
team and preact team, thanks to both.

114
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:06.432
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
