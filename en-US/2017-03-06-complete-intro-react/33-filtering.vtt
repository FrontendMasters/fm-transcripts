00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.372
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go back and
change this to stop being a search term,

2
00:00:03.372 --> 00:00:07.039
and just say this is s video again,
or whatever you called your brand.

3
00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:14.490
Save that, readdress that, readdress that.

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.334
So now let's do the part
that I think's really fun.

5
00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:21.184
So we have a map right here.

6
00:00:21.184 --> 00:00:26.050
There's another method in JavaScript
on array is called filter.

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.950
So if I put in a .filter statement,
this is very similar to how map works.

8
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.630
But instead of returns a new value,
you just return true or false.

9
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.497
If it returns true, you keep to the array.

10
00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:38.489
And if it returns false,

11
00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.543
it kicks it out of the array.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

12
00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:49.324
I have a show here as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

13
00:00:49.324 --> 00:00:53.640
what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to return.

14
00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:02.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this a little clever.

15
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.070
But I think it's on
the borderlines of acceptable.

16
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.878
So I'm gonna do show.title.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Show.description

17
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:16.681
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So these are the two fields

18
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:17.678
that we're going to search, right?

19
00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:19.961
So I'm gonna concatenate
them together in one string.

20
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:24.739
I'm going to put them toUpperCase.

21
00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:27.930
Because I wanna be case
insensitive in my search.

22
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.985
And then I'm going

23
00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:41.183
to say, indexOf.

24
00:01:41.183 --> 00:01:46.352
This.state.searchTerm.toUpperCase, cuz
I want that to be

25
00:01:46.352 --> 00:01:51.520
case sensitive as well,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is

26
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.320
greater than or equal to 0.

27
00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:00.287
So let's kind of unpack this,
this is a little dense.

28
00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:03.795
Show.title, show.description.

29
00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:05.445
Right, these are the two
fields that we're searching.

30
00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:07.720
So we're putting them
together in one string.

31
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.484
We're making that uppercase so
that it's case insensitive.

32
00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:16.080
And we're saying indexOf it says
if you find this string anywhere,

33
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.440
give me the index of it.

34
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.039
So if that's greater than or equal to 0.

35
00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.841
So that basically says
if you find this string

36
00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:26.980
anywhere inside of this other string,
then return true, right?

37
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.360
So for returns true, it stays in
the array and if it returns false.

38
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.050
If it didn't find it anywhere on
the array, it kicks it out of the array.

39
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.360
So, I'll come back to this but

40
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.609
let me show you what's actually happening.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

41
00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:47.990
whatever, I'll fix that later.

42
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.726
Refresh.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

43
00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:57.437
I have a blank search, but
as soon as I type house, right,

44
00:02:57.437 --> 00:03:03.510
only House of Cards and
Fuller House have the words house in them.

45
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.780
So that's the only ones that stay or
if I put Kimmy,

46
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.740
I only get Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,
right?

47
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.260
Cuz that's where Kimmy is and
then Kimmy right there,

48
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.620
also Fuller House.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is just a really

49
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.997
poor man's way of doing search, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

50
00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:29.590
this is a little clever but
that's what's going on there.

51
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.137
Any questions about that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They're wondering if this is

52
00:03:33.137 --> 00:03:34.841
how you do it at Netflix?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No.

53
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.583
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

54
00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:38.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's a whole team

55
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.286
at Netflix that all they
worry about is search.

56
00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:46.064
That's certainly not me.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Unless

57
00:03:46.064 --> 00:03:49.658
you're doing client site only search,

58
00:03:49.658 --> 00:03:54.423
this is probably woefully
even inadequate for that.

59
00:03:54.423 --> 00:04:01.910
But it's impressive enough for a demo, so.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions?

60
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: For something like the to

61
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.270
do list, classic thing,
it's beautiful for saying,

62
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.100
just show me all the a priority items.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, exactly.

63
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.180
So, using filter like this, totally fine.

64
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.510
As long as this filter's
fairly performant, otherwise,

65
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.120
you probably need to
[INAUDIBLE] it a little bit.

66
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.410
This is obviously not a Perf workshop,
so we're not gonna do that.

67
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.039
But, using filter like this inside of.

68
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.780
Inside of your map that's totally
acceptable, that's a normal usual thing to

69
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:44.857
do.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

70
00:04:44.857 --> 00:04:47.400
you can even make this
a little bit shorter...

71
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.850
If you tak off the curly braces.

72
00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:59.434
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again, a little dense but

73
00:04:59.434 --> 00:05:05.175
that works too.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz remember,

74
00:05:05.175 --> 00:05:07.430
it's an implicit return.

75
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.910
So, that'll return true or false.

76
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.150
And then that true stays in,

77
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.803
false gets kicked out.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And,

78
00:05:16.803 --> 00:05:20.420
I also wanted to make this an empty
string right here, searchTerm.

79
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.380
Just make this an empty string.

80
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.820
So that the initial value of
the search is everything.

81
00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:40.429
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I think we'll be done

82
00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:41.850
around 5 today.

83
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:49.760
If I go over testing,
yeah, this should be good.

84
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.702
Cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

85
00:05:54.702 --> 00:05:56.527
that's what I'm about to
move on to is testing.

86
00:05:56.527 --> 00:05:59.822
Does anyone have any other
questions before I move on?

87
00:05:59.822 --> 00:06:00.791
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a question

88
00:06:00.791 --> 00:06:01.475
from Louis R.

89
00:06:01.475 --> 00:06:04.451
Could the filter map logic be
moved out of render to improve

90
00:06:04.451 --> 00:06:08.628
the readability?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I suppose that's at

91
00:06:08.628 --> 00:06:09.900
the call of the user.

92
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.380
I think this is,
like obviously filter's a little dense.

93
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.220
I might take this particular part
of the function, like this part.

94
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.104
So maybe,

95
00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:28.875
filter out, right?

96
00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:32.867
And then this would be
a separate function and

97
00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:36.970
one might consider doing that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They're really just array

98
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.140
prototype function so
you could put a function,

99
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.620
a declared function in there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

100
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.760
is not specific to React,
I think that's a good point to be made.
