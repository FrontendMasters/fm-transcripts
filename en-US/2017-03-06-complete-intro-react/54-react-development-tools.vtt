1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.148
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, let's go ahead and
let's do React tools real quick.

2
00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:09.464
I've been showing you various different
ways of doing debugging with React like

3
00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:12.210
console logging, right,
that's a classic one.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.942
Dumping stuff out to the dom with
the pre-code JSON stringify stuff.

5
00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:19.799
But there's a better way, and
I wanted to show you that right now.

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.817
So if you just Google react devtools,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You're gonna get,

7
00:00:29.817 --> 00:00:32.470
usually one of the first
ones here is Chrome, right?

8
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.170
And then the fourth one
down here is Firefox.

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.990
So click on either one of those,
I use Firefox, so I click on that one.

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.910
Add to Firefox, I already have it on here.

11
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.370
So I'm gonna just use it on here, but
go ahead and add your favorite version.

12
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.012
Safari doesn't have one,
they used to have a stripped down one and

13
00:00:55.012 --> 00:00:57.163
I think they just stopped supporting it,

14
00:00:57.163 --> 00:01:01.108
because I don't think many people
develop directly for Safari these days.

15
00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:06.680
You can technically plug Chrome into
Edge to get that to work, but good luck.

16
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.950
Anyway, Firefox and
Chrome both have these dev tools.

17
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.760
If you open my dev tools here, you'll
see that I have a React tab right there.

18
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.965
So if you come back here to
Frontend Masters, React, and

19
00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:27.201
I open my dev tools, you'll see
that I have a React tab right here.

20
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:28.558
Let's try refreshing that.

21
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.871
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I didn't
leave throttling on, did I?

22
00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.568
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope.

23
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:47.387
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this should just work,
but famous last words.

24
00:01:53.507 --> 00:01:54.879
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this all works.

25
00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:59.104
Is it working for other people or
is it still saying loading React?

26
00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:01.436
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's working in Chrome.

27
00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:01.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's working in Chrome.

28
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.777
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's just try killing it, and try.

29
00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:08.575
I've had this problem before,
where it just cannot connect to React.

30
00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:14.669
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

31
00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:21.552
if we say localhost:8080,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go,

32
00:02:21.552 --> 00:02:22.860
so I'm plugged in now.

33
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.490
So sometimes it has a difficult
time hooking into React.

34
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.180
And especially when you're
bundling like we are right now,

35
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.060
you just kind of have to turn it off and
turn it on again.

36
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.980
Like, just try finagling with
it until it eventually connects.

37
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.827
But you'll end up with something
that looks like this, right.

38
00:02:41.448 --> 00:02:44.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Basically
a dom explorer but for React.

39
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.340
So now if we look at here, you'll see app,
you'll see browser router.

40
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.300
And browser router has a bunch of
layers in it, so just be aware of that.

41
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.441
You'll have to go through
a bunch of React Router.

42
00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:57.546
But you'll eventually land in,
okay, here's App, there's my div,

43
00:02:57.546 --> 00:03:00.020
here's my different matches.

44
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.130
So let's go look inside of this one
because that's the one we're in.

45
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.220
Bunch of more stuff for React Router.

46
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.150
And eventually we land in Landing, right.

47
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.745
And then we can see,
we can click on Landing.

48
00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:19.446
You can see over here the Props
that are in Landing, right.

49
00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:24.838
You can see the params being passed,
location, bunch of stuff like that.

50
00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:27.120
You can look what's in the link, right.

51
00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.690
So let's do something a little
bit more interesting.

52
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.920
Let's go to Browse All.

53
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.300
So it's something that
people keep bringing up.

54
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.380
We have not fixed this search box yet.

55
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.840
Just so if it doesn't work,
that's because we haven't fixed it yet.

56
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.349
We'll fix it with Redux.

57
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.490
Okay, so let's go into, I don't know,
Love or something like that.

58
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.880
Okay, and now we're going to
look at the dev tools in React.

59
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.068
So going through all the different
layers is crazy annoying, right,

60
00:03:57.068 --> 00:03:58.700
like I don't want to do that.

61
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.560
So a really quick short cut
is just to right click on

62
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.249
whatever component you're interested in,
say Inspect Element.

63
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.352
That'll take you to the normal Inspector,
right, and

64
00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:10.029
then you just click over on React.

65
00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:12.130
And it's smart enough usually,

66
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.418
it's usually smart enough to take
you directly to that component.

67
00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.067
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I am just having
an issue today with React dev tools.

68
00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:29.827
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, well,

69
00:04:29.827 --> 00:04:32.720
the secondary one is you can
search down here at the bottom.

70
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.260
So if I say Details, right,
I can just click on it and go there.

71
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.410
That's horribly annoying, though.

72
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.809
Okay, so now I'm on Details.

73
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.670
But now look,
I can see the state here, right.

74
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.507
So I have my omdbData right here,
I can explore it and

75
00:04:47.507 --> 00:04:50.226
see everything that's
coming back from the API.

76
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.040
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All that kinda stuff, but
what's even more interesting is because

77
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.510
it's state, right, I can actually just go
in and mess with this data if I want to.

78
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.541
So let's do that, so
where's the IMDB score?

79
00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:08.370
This actually wasn't a 7.8 but
it was 107.8, so that's the new rating.

80
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.290
You'll see it updated
right there in the UI

81
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.566
instantly cuz it's just calling set state,
right.

82
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.901
Or you can go in and say, where's Header?

83
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:24.568
So search for Header down here.

84
00:05:31.187 --> 00:05:34.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Except we wanna
do it inside of Browse All.

85
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.760
So search for Header, click on that.

86
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.296
I was just getting it from Search,
so actually we wanna look at Search,

87
00:05:45.296 --> 00:05:46.158
that's what I wanted.

88
00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:51.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so I have Search
in here, I have searchTerm down here.

89
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.763
I can modify that to say dare,
right, and hit enter.

90
00:05:55.763 --> 00:05:59.740
And all of a sudden, it does the search,
everything like that, right there for me.

91
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.320
So you can kinda mess around with the
state to kinda get it in the state that

92
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.040
you want to to mess around with it.

93
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.450
It's really useful for that.

94
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.050
It's useful for
seeing what props are being passed where.

95
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.530
And another useful thing that it does is,

96
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.160
let's say I need to
programmatically mess with search.

97
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.070
While I have it selected here in the dev
tools, I can come over here to Console and

98
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.752
now whatever I had selected in
the dev tools is saved as $r.

99
00:06:28.413 --> 00:06:31.727
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now I actually have a handle on this, so

100
00:06:31.727 --> 00:06:37.713
I can start messing around with it and
say $r, what is your state, right?

101
00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:39.603
And it'll show me the state.

102
00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:44.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think it's pretty cool,
pretty compelling.

103
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.632
It's a really easy and
useful way of debugging React.

104
00:06:49.711 --> 00:06:51.801
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I use them all the time,
so,

105
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:54.861
any questions about the React dev tools?

106
00:06:58.052 --> 00:07:01.249
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again,
available on Firefox, available on Chrome,

107
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:02.388
cross-platform.

108
00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:04.980
You should definitely,
definitely use them.
