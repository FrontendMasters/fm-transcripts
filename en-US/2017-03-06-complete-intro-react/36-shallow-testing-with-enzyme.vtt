00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I put something here
in show-card to interest something,

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.160
I'm gonna go ahead and assert that's
kind of problematic about this.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.080
I changed something in show-card yet

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.030
my test in search is failing and
I think that's a problem.

5
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.210
Other people may disagree with me.

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.979
I think it's a problem because if
there's a problem with show-card,

7
00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:24.850
I want my show-card test to fail, right?

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.638
And if I have a problem with search,
I want my search test to fail so

9
00:00:27.638 --> 00:00:29.380
it tells me exactly where my problem is.

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.340
Well, why is this failing?

11
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.120
Well, I have this test render and
it renders everything underneath search.

12
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.850
It'd be really nice if it could only
render everything underneath search

13
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.144
that only go one layer deep.

14
00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:43.610
Only have a shallow render and

15
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.810
not necessarily have all of the components
underneath it render as well.

16
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.034
And that way those tests can fail, so
if I have a problem with show-card,

17
00:00:52.034 --> 00:00:54.220
only show-card fails and
search doesn't fail.

18
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.840
Luckily there is actually
a way to accomplish this.

19
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.891
And we're going to bring in, excuse me,
another library called Enzyme to do so.

20
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.256
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But first let's go to

21
00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:14.608
package.json.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

22
00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:17.570
I'm sick of it writing all that stuff.

23
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.050
So I'm gonna say test =

24
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.652
"NODE_ENV=test jest",

25
00:01:27.652 --> 00:01:32.806
or whatever flavor of shell

26
00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:36.850
that you're using.

27
00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:50.888
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

28
00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:55.893
now I can just run npm run test,
everyone's happy, right,

29
00:01:55.893 --> 00:02:02.719
npm run test.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

30
00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.949
I broke it, so that's why.

31
00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:08.580
But just as an npm sidenote,
instead of npm run test,

32
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.456
since supposedly we should
be testing our code, right,

33
00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:17.550
a lot npm gives you the convenience
of saying npm test that also works.

34
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.721
Or you can actually even
go as short as saying npm

35
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:22.290
t.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

36
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.150
that always corresponds
to the test in scripts.

37
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.090
That's just a shortcut that they gave you.

38
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.361
I think start does that as well, but I
think those are the only two that it'll do

39
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:37.648
that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

40
00:02:37.648 --> 00:02:41.751
so come back to spec.

41
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:44.042
And we have that in our package.json, so

42
00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:48.640
we're gonna move from react-test-renderer
to using what's called Enzyme.

43
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.131
Enzyme is a library from
our friends over at Airbnb.

44
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:56.939
It is not necessarily the official testing
library of React because they refuse to

45
00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.320
bless any one library as that.

46
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.200
But it is the library that Facebook uses,

47
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.536
which pretty much makes it official.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We use Enzyme,

48
00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:10.127
if you're gonna be testing React,
you're gonna be using Enzyme or

49
00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:15.694
you should.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what I'm gonna do here,

50
00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:20.781
is I'm gonna say,
import { shallow } from 'enzyme'.

51
00:03:23.012 --> 00:03:27.483
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're going to import {

52
00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:35.132
shallowToJson } from 'enzyme-to-json',

53
00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.708
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is not from Airbnb.

54
00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:41.102
It's from someone else
that's really smart.

55
00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:45.951
I don't remember who it is.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

56
00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:49.980
we're gonna slightly modify
our snapshot test down here.

57
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.240
So I showed you the other one,
initially, that's the barebones one.

58
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.390
But I think the Enzyme way of
doing it's a little bit better.

59
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.720
So we're gonna say shallow here and
tree is going to be

60
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.946
shallowToJson.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Component and

61
00:04:12.946 --> 00:04:15.588
then the last line stays the same.

62
00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:27.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So to talk about shallow.

63
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.560
Shallow does exactly what I was
describing a few minutes ago,

64
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.060
which is that it's going to
render out everything in search.

65
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.030
But it's not going to go
any deeper than that.

66
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.986
So it's gonna hit show-card and
it's just going to say, okay,

67
00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:41.344
here's another component.

68
00:04:41.344 --> 00:04:44.496
This is the component, this is
the properties that we'll receive, but

69
00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:46.571
I'm not going to render
that component at all.

70
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.410
I'll show you what that looks like.

71
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.630
But it only goes one layer deep.

72
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.317
ShallowToJson, DumpSetToJson,
which then you can do a snapshot test on.

73
00:04:56.317 --> 00:05:00.277
The other thing I should tell you
about jest in snapshot testing,

74
00:05:00.277 --> 00:05:03.690
all it does is compare one
JSON structure to another.

75
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.220
That's all it does.

76
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.670
So if you're testing server responses for

77
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.190
your node server, you can just
dump that to a JSON structure.

78
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.490
Do a snapshot test on that and
there you go.

79
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.240
You just roll with that.

80
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.160
So anything that you can dump
to some sort of JSON structure,

81
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.256
you can do snapshot testing on.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which I

82
00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:25.615
think's pretty cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, save that,

83
00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:29.098
come back over here, say npm test.

84
00:05:29.098 --> 00:05:31.625
It's gonna fail miserably
now because a lot has

85
00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:37.120
changed.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: injectEnvironment

86
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.635
can be called once.

87
00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:39.708
That's new.

88
00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:52.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No cache.

89
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.328
I can't imagine that would be the reason,

90
00:05:54.328 --> 00:05:59.152
but.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

91
00:05:59.152 --> 00:06:00.883
yeah, that's the problem here.

92
00:06:00.883 --> 00:06:06.122
So we have render array here, which is
actually used internally in Enzyme.

93
00:06:06.122 --> 00:06:07.190
So you actually have to dump that.

94
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.583
So this line right here, line 3,

95
00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:14.710
import renderer from react-test-render,
drop that line.

96
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.404
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,

97
00:06:26.404 --> 00:06:30.380
if you look up here in the green,
this is what you expect.

98
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.990
You see all these divs, right?

99
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.414
With Club de Cuervos,
Making a Murder, right?

100
00:06:36.414 --> 00:06:39.562
But if you look down
here at the new output,

101
00:06:39.562 --> 00:06:42.632
it just outputs the jsx version, right?

102
00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:45.113
So it says, okay, well,
this was a ShowCard and

103
00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.294
here's all the properties I got with it.

104
00:06:47.294 --> 00:06:50.080
imdbID poster, right?

105
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.290
And that's what we actually want.

106
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.100
So we're actually gonna go
put that to a package.json.

107
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.952
So go back to your package.json.

108
00:07:03.952 --> 00:07:11.134
Underneath test,
we're gonna have one called update-test,

109
00:07:11.134 --> 00:07:15.820
which is going to be npm run test -- -u.

110
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.849
Npm run test -- -u.

111
00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:21.420
Which you're gonna call every
time you wanna update your tests.

112
00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:24.198
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That way you don't have to

113
00:07:24.198 --> 00:07:27.275
remember the flag because I am terrible
at remembering flags, so I refuse to.

114
00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:36.725
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Save that, come back

115
00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:41.179
to your terminal and

116
00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:47.230
say npm run update-test.

117
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.710
And now we have one solid snapshot test.

118
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:54.510
So this is nice because ShowCard can
go break in whatever way it wants to.

119
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.680
And it should fail your ShowCard
test that you'll write later.

120
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.115
Well, I'm not gonna write it,
but you should write it.

121
00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:05.610
[LAUGH] But
it should fail the ShowCard test and

122
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:11.756
it should not fail the search test.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

123
00:08:11.756 --> 00:08:14.460
I'm going to go take out that h3, yeah.

124
00:08:21.306 --> 00:08:24.216
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about

125
00:08:24.216 --> 00:08:29.221
snapshot testing?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How

126
00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:33.369
did you get it to print
the JSON out in your terminal,

127
00:08:33.369 --> 00:08:36.680
when you run the test?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To print out this stuff?

128
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:38.650
I failed the test.

129
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.400
Yeah, so when it fails, [COUGH] excuse me,

130
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.320
it'll print out the div.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay,

131
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:54.060
it's really cuz I didn't do the ShowCard.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any

132
00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:01.089
other questions?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's

133
00:09:01.089 --> 00:09:05.621
just a little general confusion
about when you would do

134
00:09:05.621 --> 00:09:09.342
this sort of testing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So generally I would

135
00:09:09.342 --> 00:09:13.030
take in a component that I wrote and
just write a quick snapshot test for it.

136
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:19.280
So I'm not gonna assert maybe for
each component test or for each component.

137
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.490
But maybe for important components or
specifically display components.

138
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.024
It's usually helpful.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

139
00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:29.627
they're saying things like,
it should be more stable probably.

140
00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:32.687
If your output is changing a lot and you
haven't quite got your design figured out

141
00:09:32.687 --> 00:09:34.303
and things like that-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [CROSSTALK] Yeah,

142
00:09:34.303 --> 00:09:36.651
then it's just noise.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

143
00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:38.241
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it's a cheap test that

144
00:09:38.241 --> 00:09:42.490
easily breaks but it's easy to update,
so that's the tradeoff.

145
00:09:47.806 --> 00:09:49.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're asking if we can do

146
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:55.857
a test on ShowCard, it's
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One may, I will not.

147
00:09:55.857 --> 00:09:58.520
[LAUGH] We're gonna write two more tests,
though.

148
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.000
I'm just gonna test search, but

149
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.930
you're welcome to go test
everything else if you want to
