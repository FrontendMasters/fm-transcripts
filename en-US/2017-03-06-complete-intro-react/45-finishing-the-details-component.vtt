00:00:00.354 --> 00:00:02.390
&gt;&gt; Brian: We're gonna make
it look nice and pretty now.

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.523
So, first thing we're gonna do
is we gonna do some PropTypes.

3
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:18.072
&gt;&gt; Brian: So one thing I'll say
about PropTypes in general,

4
00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:23.682
it's almost I'm not gonna say it's TDD,
but it's like a TDD mindset of like,

5
00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:29.020
I'm identifying first what I need,
and then I'm gonna go do it.

6
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.310
So by writing your PropTypes first,
you're kinda saying,

7
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.960
here's the shape of my component.

8
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.050
Here's what my component expects.

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.770
You're kind of establishing
your own expectations.

10
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.473
So a good place to start when you're
writing a brand new component is

11
00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:41.381
establishing the props
that you expect to get.

12
00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:46.974
&gt;&gt; Brian: So in other words,
I write my PropTypes first,

13
00:00:46.974 --> 00:00:50.390
rather than going back and
writing them after I've already done it.

14
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.810
But that's just a mindset,
do what works for you.

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.990
So here, I'm gonna get a show, right?

16
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.700
The show is going to come in with a shape.

17
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.629
And it's gonna have a title.

18
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.813
&gt;&gt; Brian: Year, poster, and trailer.

19
00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:21.764
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

20
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.083
I'm gonna come down here to render,
say const {title, description}.

21
00:01:30.083 --> 00:01:31.967
Did I not put description up there?

22
00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:34.299
Totally should have.

23
00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.869
Description, year,

24
00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.961
poster, trailer.

25
00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.917
&gt;&gt; Brian: Equals this.props.show.

26
00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:51.555
So just pull those out real quick.

27
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:58.163
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and then now we're just
gonna do some nice looking markup.

28
00:01:58.163 --> 00:02:02.978
We're gonna put a nice header
on it with whatever your

29
00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:06.300
brand was inside of an h1 actually.

30
00:02:10.287 --> 00:02:12.515
&gt;&gt; Brian: Then we're gonna have a section.

31
00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:17.093
&gt;&gt; Brian: With an h1.

32
00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:19.812
&gt;&gt; Brian: Title.

33
00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:30.349
&gt;&gt; Brian: An h2 with year
inside a parentheses.

34
00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.147
An image showing the poster.

35
00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:44.480
&gt;&gt; Brian: And always put all text, always,
always, because we need it accessible.

36
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.434
That being said,
I'm not gonna do it today, but you should.

37
00:02:52.524 --> 00:02:57.423
&gt;&gt; Brian: Actually,
I'm gonna make that with

38
00:02:57.423 --> 00:03:02.180
`/public/image/posters`.

39
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.810
You should also watch the Frontend Masters
on the accessible web.

40
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.563
Top quality stuff.

41
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.821
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so this is going to be
like our information at the top and

42
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:29.123
underneath this section we're
going to have a div with

43
00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:32.600
an iframe in it cuz
everyone loves iframes.

44
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.700
Now that's how you have to do YouTube so
that's why we're doing it that way.

45
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.825
So source is gonna be just
this stupid long URL.

46
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:52.107
https://www.youtube-nocookie cuz

47
00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:58.791
I don't like cookies, just kidding.

48
00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:08.741
.com/embed/$(trailer).

49
00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:13.869
&gt;&gt; Brian: rel=0.

50
00:04:18.997 --> 00:04:20.985
&gt;&gt; Brian: If you don't feel
like typing all this out,

51
00:04:20.985 --> 00:04:24.062
I'm fine to just push a branch after
this and you can just pull it down

52
00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.349
&gt;&gt; Brian: Controls equal

53
00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:38.360
0&amp;amp showinfo

54
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.180
equals zero.

55
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.892
Okay, we need to make frame border
&gt;&gt; Brian: Camel cased

56
00:04:47.892 --> 00:04:49.880
because that's how react expects it.

57
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.288
Change those to single quotes
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

58
00:04:56.288 --> 00:04:58.625
then we wanna do allow full screen.

59
00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:06.048
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

60
00:05:13.577 --> 00:05:17.190
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, sorry for the long URL,
but I obviously did not write YouTube.

61
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.860
So before I push it,
let me make sure that it actually works.

62
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.068
So if you come back here and refresh,

63
00:05:27.068 --> 00:05:34.294
you should get a kind of
nice looking details page.

64
00:05:37.777 --> 00:05:40.950
&gt;&gt; Brian: I gave this workshop once before
and someone told me they got a Netflix

65
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.920
subscription because they started
watching all the trailers.

66
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.468
So I was like yes, mission accomplished.

67
00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:48.009
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Bonus!

68
00:05:51.554 --> 00:05:53.867
&gt;&gt; Brian: So should work.

69
00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:56.297
Okay, so let me go ahead and
cut a branch here.

70
00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:05.702
&gt;&gt; Brian: git checkout -b v2-14.

71
00:06:05.702 --> 00:06:07.180
git commit -m 14, git push.

72
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.411
So that I just pushed v2-14.

73
00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:18.838
&gt;&gt; Brian: Great.

74
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.444
&gt;&gt; Brian: Any questions about details?

75
00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:24.407
Let's go back to the code.

76
00:06:24.407 --> 00:06:25.878
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have a longer question.

77
00:06:25.878 --> 00:06:26.654
&gt;&gt; Brian: Sure.

78
00:06:26.654 --> 00:06:30.737
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: With data marshaling,
how do you pass optionally property,

79
00:06:30.737 --> 00:06:33.329
I guess that's optional properties,

80
00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:38.220
to children components from parent
component with react router?

81
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.399
When both parent and child component
are rendered by react router such as,

82
00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:48.088
localhost/parent,
localhost/parent/childone,

83
00:06:48.088 --> 00:06:52.140
localhost/parent/childtwo, and

84
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.950
I only want to pass data to child one,
child two and not child three.

85
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.510
&gt;&gt; Brian: I think the answer to that
question is kind of the paradigm

86
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.620
that I showed you here,
where you use these anonymous functions.

87
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.190
Because inside of here,
this is just the function body, right?

88
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.120
So you can return whatever
you want at the end,

89
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.450
and react router doesn't actually care.

90
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.760
It's just going to render
this entire component, right?

91
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.610
So you're free to put if statements in
here and if condition a, return this.

92
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.330
If condition b, return this other thing.

93
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.341
You're free to script that
to your heart's content.

94
00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:31.250
&gt;&gt; Brian: Hopefully that
satisfies your answer.

95
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.040
I'm not sure if I totally
grasped the question.

96
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Interesting.

97
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.760
Amber Lee is saying that their
poster image is spinning because.

98
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.710
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah because they
put the alt text on it.

99
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.720
Yeah take the alt text off.

100
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.710
It's my CSS.

101
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.610
Yeah, I wrote shitty CSS and
I'm the first to acknowledge it.

102
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.363
Cuz we're going to put
a loading circle on there.

103
00:07:56.363 --> 00:07:59.297
And as soon as you put the alt text
on there, that's when it spins.

104
00:08:01.345 --> 00:08:04.550
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cuz [LAUGH] I've
given this workshop before,

105
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.650
this is my disclaimer of
why I did it this way.

106
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.870
And we wrote one class name up here.

107
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.360
Imagine if you had to write
super long class names on

108
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.250
every single one of these: image,
div, h3, h4, h.

109
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.520
It just takes a lot
longer to get through it,

110
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.230
and I was really sick of waiting for
people to write class names.

111
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.190
As I was sick of just writing class names.

112
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.050
So, I was like, no I'm stripping it
all out and we're just gonna do tags.

113
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.590
So that's why it's really weird.

114
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.070
So what she's seeing,
which is kind of hilarious.

115
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:40.991
If you wanna see it,
go to details, and I put alt =

116
00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:45.780
'something' and I refresh.

117
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.312
Yeah, I gotta run my server again.

118
00:08:58.254 --> 00:08:59.089
&gt;&gt; Brian: She's seeing that.

119
00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:03.918
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
[LAUGH]

120
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.500
&gt;&gt; Brian: I should have just made that

121
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.580
the loading GIF, yeah.
