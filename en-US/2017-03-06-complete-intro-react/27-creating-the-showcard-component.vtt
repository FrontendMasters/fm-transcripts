00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is kind of boring,
right, this just shows the title so

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.210
let's actually make it a little bit nicer.

3
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.855
So what we are gonna
do here is we're gonna

4
00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:13.777
say &lt;div classname="show-card"&gt;.

5
00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:16.569
I wanna say.&lt;img src = `.

6
00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:21.565
So backticks are on
the same key as the tilde,

7
00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:26.562
for those of you that
don't typically don't

8
00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:31.310
use backticks, like most normal people.

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.064
And say

10
00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:44.064
/public/image/posters/${show.poster}

11
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.025
and then close that.

12
00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:53.680
So let's talk about this,
these are ES6 template strings.

13
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.670
They're new to ES6, they are definitely
one of my favorite features.

14
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.530
So if you've been writing
JavaScript any length of time,

15
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.800
you're very used to writing something
plus this plus this plus this plus and

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.800
you write plus a bunch of times for
string concatenations.

17
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.450
What backticks allow you to do is they
allow you to do template strings.

18
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.840
And this kind of syntax
the dollar sign curly brace,

19
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.100
if you written any sort of bash
scripting or look familiar.

20
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.770
I'm sure that's where we took it from.

21
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.200
It's just saying, okay inside of
here this is my normal string, but

22
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.720
inside of the dollar sign, curly brace,
put this JavaScript expression, right.

23
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.772
So in this particular case I want
whatever is in show.poster to be

24
00:01:31.772 --> 00:01:37.752
there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

25
00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:41.596
put a &lt;/div,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

26
00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:47.005
then inside of here, we're gonna do an h3,

27
00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:55.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: show.title, h4 show.year.

28
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.626
And actually I want those to
display inside of parentheses,

29
00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:03.130
like literally inside of parentheses, so
I'm just gonna surround it in parentheses.

30
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.190
There's nothing special about that, It's
stylistically, that's what I wanted to do.

31
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.500
Then put a &lt;p&gt;{show.description}&lt;/p&gt;
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's it.

32
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.091
So this will be a little bit
nicer display of our shows.

33
00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:26.961
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So save that,

34
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:32.050
come back to here, we'll look real quick.

35
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.180
And now you should get
these nice looking show

36
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.671
cards.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nice looking little UI.

37
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.904
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Probably still getting that

38
00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:54.556
error for keys, but
I'll talk about that momentarily.

39
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.054
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions so far?

40
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:08.249
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what someone talked

41
00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.530
about a little bit earlier was when do
I split out this into a new component?

42
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.368
When you're doing preloads or

43
00:03:14.368 --> 00:03:17.441
if you're doing like a map to
create multiple components,

44
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.320
a pretty big code smells if you're doing
a lot of markup inside of the maps.

45
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.030
It's a good place that you wanna split
that out into the different component.

46
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.900
I would say nearly always.

47
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.690
So like, for example, this right here,

48
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.970
this has no business being
just inlined right here.

49
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.495
We really need to go make this into
another component and include it in here,

50
00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:39.674
which is what we're about to do.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go,

51
00:03:39.674 --> 00:03:43.630
just like what I was saying, we're gonna
go split this out into a new component.

52
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.011
Yeah, I will split this
into a new component and

53
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:52.759
then push a new branch.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

54
00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.199
I'm gonna create a new
file called ShowCard.js.

55
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.047
I'll come back to search and
I'm going to yank this out.

56
00:04:05.047 --> 00:04:12.618
Okay, and then here I'm gonna
say import React from react,

57
00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:19.007
I'll say const ShowCard
= React.createClass.

58
00:04:21.543 --> 00:04:25.383
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Render, return,

59
00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:32.759
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

60
00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:41.645
And then, export default ShowCard
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nothing too crazy here.

61
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.261
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

62
00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:55.277
save that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could you get a variable for

63
00:04:55.277 --> 00:04:59.917
show or is that [INAUDIBLE]?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

64
00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:03.566
good point.

65
00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:07.140
So, it's actually not gonna
be available as show, right?

66
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.360
I'm sure my lynch is yelling

67
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.050
at me [INAUDIBLE] cuz we
haven't imported it yet.

68
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.750
But now this is gonna come from props,
right?

69
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:25.299
So now I have to say this
.props.show.description, right.

70
00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:28.180
Which is burdensome, to say the least,

71
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.155
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

72
00:05:34.155 --> 00:05:39.762
easy way to do this as well,
using some more ES6 magic, is we can say,

73
00:05:39.762 --> 00:05:46.817
const { poster,title,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: year, and

74
00:05:46.817 --> 00:05:54.117
description} = this.props.show.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

75
00:05:54.117 --> 00:05:55.867
now we get to cut all this stuff out.

76
00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.761
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is called

77
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:10.120
destructuring, for those of you
who have not seen this before.

78
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.520
There's a great duality post,
2ality.com, post on it.

79
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.970
It's basically saying
inside of this show object,

80
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.280
I know it has a parameter called poster,
title, year, and description,

81
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.710
I want you to pull those out as poster,
right.

82
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:35.704
So this is exactly the same as saying,
const poster = this.props.show.poster.

83
00:06:35.704 --> 00:06:39.930
It's just a shorthand of doing that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How safe is that?

84
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.921
Is it actually checking that
the property names match or

85
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:46.470
is it just taking them in order?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

86
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.200
it’s perfectly safe to do.

87
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.576
I mean, this is literally
what it gets compiled to,

88
00:06:51.576 --> 00:06:54.774
so.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As long as you know

89
00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:55.510
it’s there, right.

90
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.088
I mean, it’s as dangerous as doing this,
that’s probably the best way to say that.

91
00:07:09.035 --> 00:07:10.651
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It might be my favorite ES6

92
00:07:10.651 --> 00:07:11.290
feature.

93
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.120
It saves me a lot of lines of code,
so I like it.

94
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.400
Yeah, as soon as we include this show-card
thing, it's gonna start yelling at us.

95
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.331
So Import ShowCard, this is in

96
00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:31.036
search.js, from ./ShowCard.

97
00:07:31.036 --> 00:07:35.351
And then here we're gonna say

98
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:40.190
return ShowCard = show = show.

99
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.794
All right, so we're taking the show, and

100
00:07:42.794 --> 00:07:48.753
we're passing it down into the ShowCard.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

101
00:07:48.753 --> 00:07:52.900
now we get a bunch of
prop validation errors.

102
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.331
That's okay, we expect that,

103
00:07:54.331 --> 00:07:59.180
we'll fix that momentarily.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But if you refresh,

104
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.940
everything should still work.

105
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.949
But now we have a ShowCard component
which is kind of self-contained for

106
00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:07.157
all these ShowCard needs.
