00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.608
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If we go back to, and

2
00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:10.106
I pushed v2-21 if anyone
needs a new bundle or

3
00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:14.240
a new whatever, a new branch.

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.959
So if we do npm run test right now
it's just gonna barf all over us.

5
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.358
I don't think any of them pass.

6
00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:28.402
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's do npm.

7
00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:38.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So snapshot failed,
3 tests failed, 0 passed, right?

8
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.640
Everything broke in this process.

9
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.070
Because we introduced Redux, and

10
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.130
Redux just threw a whole of
wrenches into our tests, rIght?

11
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.670
Because now our components
depend on Redux being there,

12
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.800
and the way that they get Redux injected
into them is through a provider, and

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.090
provider is provided through the route.

14
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.000
Sorry, through the router.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.115
And so, because the router is not present,
we have to somehow account for that.

16
00:01:04.487 --> 00:01:07.239
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go do that.

17
00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.563
So go back to Search.js.

18
00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:19.510
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So down here at the bottom
we're exporting a connected search.

19
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.170
But this doesn't actually
gonna work because,

20
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.230
unless Redux has to be there or
connect is gonna fail.

21
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.340
So how can we get around that?

22
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.720
Well, you'll see it's pretty common
in these sort of scenarios for

23
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.110
people to do something like this.

24
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.990
They're gonna say export

25
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.330
const Unwrapped = Search.

26
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.730
So this Unwrapped right here is purely for
testing purposes.

27
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.420
So it's the same component it's
just not wrapped inside of Redux.

28
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.412
So now we can go back to search.spec.js.

29
00:02:05.517 --> 00:02:08.757
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
up here at the top where we import search,

30
00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:10.215
we can also import.

31
00:02:17.562 --> 00:02:18.532
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Unwrapped.

32
00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:27.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As UnwrappedSearch.

33
00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.982
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The reason I do this is
I rename it to be UnwrappedSearch so

34
00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:37.678
it's a little bit more
clear what Unwrapped is.

35
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:45.141
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

36
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.640
So now I have this that's
not dependent on Redux.

37
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.070
So here on Search I can make this,

38
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.690
instead of being Search,
it can be UnwrappedSearch.

39
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.990
And then I just have to pass the same
things that Redux would have passed

40
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.590
in, right?

41
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.223
So I passed in shows={preload.shows}.

42
00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:17.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
searchTerm= empty string, right?

43
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.400
Those are the two things that Redux
would have passed into search.

44
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.230
But we can just kind of like, manually
do it to get it up and going, okay?

45
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.180
So I'm just gonna comment
out the other two tests so

46
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.030
we can just test this first test.

47
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.022
I saved that and come back here and
try and run npm test again.

48
00:03:52.094 --> 00:03:56.538
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So our snapshot is
failing cuz compared to last time,

49
00:03:56.538 --> 00:04:01.200
we now have abstracted out our header,
right?

50
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200
Which is a connected header.

51
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.440
Whereas before we had the header
just written straight in there.

52
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.812
This is what we expect, this is good, so

53
00:04:09.812 --> 00:04:13.701
now we're going to run
npm run update-test.

54
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:20.645
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
now we have a new snapshot, and

55
00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:22.530
we have fixed our first test.
