WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.240
&gt;&gt; Brian: So let's go make a second
route that routes to our search page.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.490
So create a new file called search.js,

3
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.140
and inside that search.js, we're just
gonna put almost like hello world here.

4
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.130
But import react from react,
and right after I finish this,

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.280
I will push up a new branch.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.925
Const search equals react.create class.

7
00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:31.289
Render.

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.858
Return.

9
00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.380
&gt;&gt; Brian: Whatever you
want to put in here.

10
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.650
It doesn't really matter
because we'll change it.

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.240
Search page.
[COUGH] Bless you.

12
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.360
And export default.

13
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.890
Search.

14
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.880
Do you consider it bad practice to comment
like that within your component with JSX?

16
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.985
&gt;&gt; Brian: I mean,
I guess if I had a good reason to.

17
00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:08.897
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Depends on if you're
sitting in a workshop or not.

18
00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:11.290
&gt;&gt; Brian: [LAUGH] Yeah it's great for

19
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.390
if you need to leave notes
on some research project.

20
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.920
I don't I guess is the best answer I have.

21
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian: If someone leaves a comment in

22
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.060
there I don't know if I'm
gonna be mad about it but

23
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.130
I don't really comment
in my code that much.

24
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.887
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does webpack get rid
of that kind of stuff, delete it?

25
00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:29.460
&gt;&gt; Brian: I go with firewall just
because it's an empty object.

26
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.715
It's not used for anything.

27
00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:33.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Check at
optimize [INAUDIBLE].

28
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.100
&gt;&gt; Brian: Mm-hm.

29
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Another
comment not a question.

30
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.980
That you can use dangerous HTML to put
in HTML style comments if you want them,

31
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.570
obviously to render into the result.

32
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.500
&gt;&gt; Brian: That would be
how you would do it.

33
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.630
There is a API within react called
dangerously set inner HTML.

34
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.040
It is purposely poorly named and
longly named so that you don't do it.

35
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.006
But it's like unsanitized,
directly I'll put this to the dom.

36
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:03.300
And if it's you doing it and

37
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.500
you control exactly the string going
out there, it's fine, no problem.

38
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.200
However, it's user generated content.

39
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.790
It's a huge XSS vulnerability.

40
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.867
So the answer to that question is,
don't use it.

41
00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:17.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It kind of raises
of an interesting point.

42
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.900
When you do want comments to
show up in the source, right.

43
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.280
What would that be useful for?

44
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.560
&gt;&gt; Brian: I mean we don't put
any on Netflix's website.

45
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Some people do code off.

46
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well you want your cute
logo with the bunny hop in it right?

47
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.130
&gt;&gt; Brian: I guess.

48
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.624
Something like that.

49
00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:42.051
Logo or I mean, I would include the
authorship stuff inside of the JavaScript,

50
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:44.407
as a JavaScript comment, right?

51
00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:50.726
&gt;&gt; Brian: But, so yeah,
that is available if you need that.

52
00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:56.150
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so save your search page.

53
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.780
Go to client app.js Import
landing from landing.

54
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.197
Sorry, import search from search, rather.

55
00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:08.506
&gt;&gt; Brian: ./search.

56
00:03:11.301 --> 00:03:14.104
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then,
we're gonna put another match here.

57
00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:18.590
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
we wanna get rid of the exactly.

58
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.330
Then we put /search.

59
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
Then we want to go to
search instead of landing.

60
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.900
So as you can see here,
adding new routes, not really a big deal.

61
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.430
Pretty easy to do.

62
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This is the latest
version of the router?

63
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.860
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yes.

64
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.630
This is view four.

65
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This might be an OS or
something, Tom was saying I'm getting

66
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.710
there are multiple modules with names
that only differ in casing error.

67
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.730
Though it works fine.

68
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.010
What's this about?

69
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.370
&gt;&gt; Brian: I've never seen
that error before but

70
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.445
it sounds like he has multiple
modules named the same thing.

71
00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:00.805
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, it's like, uppercase.

72
00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:04.200
&gt;&gt; Brian: [LAUGH] That
error sounds descriptive,

73
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.770
I guess would be the best way to put that.

74
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.595
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Listen to it.

75
00:04:06.595 --> 00:04:09.935
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian: God damn you.

76
00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:20.070
&gt;&gt; Brian: Great, so
now if we save, refresh our page.

77
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.202
And just URL hack to
go to the search page.

78
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.423
&gt;&gt; Brian: We should see search page.

79
00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:38.644
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now remember you still need the
#/, right cuz we're using the hash router.

80
00:04:44.546 --> 00:04:45.416
&gt;&gt; Brian: Questions?

81
00:04:48.493 --> 00:04:50.845
&gt;&gt; Brian: I'll just go ahead and
push this real quick.

82
00:05:06.455 --> 00:05:08.731
&gt;&gt; Brian: So there it goes, v2-7.

83
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.880
&gt;&gt; Brian: Anyone have any questions or
problems?

84
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are we gonna be
covering testing today or tomorrow?

85
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.610
&gt;&gt; Brian: Tomorrow probably.

86
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: When it comes to the router,

87
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.060
are we going to cover
a nested child state?

88
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.600
&gt;&gt; Brian: Nope.

89
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.808
It's not terribly difficult to do but
you can definitely nest routes.

90
00:05:38.723 --> 00:05:40.890
&gt;&gt; Brian: It's a useful thing to do.

91
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.400
But in my limited example
it just didn't come up.

92
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

93
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.420
&gt;&gt; Brian: My last workshop does though so.

94
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.070
It's the older API but
it's relatively similar.

95
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.044
So you can check out the old one.

96
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.110
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

97
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.720
So let's make browser router work because
this HashRouter business is stupid.

98
00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:12.959
So, all you have to do is
go to web pack config,

99
00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:19.046
and you have to give it one more option,

100
00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:25.170
which is historyApiFallback:true.

101
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.100
Which is basically telling the dev server.

102
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.100
Hey, if you don't match something here,

103
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.190
the browser probably will
know what to do with it.

104
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.300
So just send it on down anyway.

105
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.710
So that's really all that does.

106
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.570
It's just saying,
reroute 404s to the homepage.

107
00:06:48.078 --> 00:06:48.580
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

108
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:55.190
And then go to ClientApp.js.

109
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.940
Where it says HashRouter,
change that to be BrowserRouter.

110
00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:10.390
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's kind of an aside.

111
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.896
What's cool about learning
things like react-router,

112
00:07:15.896 --> 00:07:19.590
react-router works perfectly
well in React Native.

113
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.810
The same API, doing the same things.

114
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.530
Everything still works.

115
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:30.310
So that's why this kind of react
idea of learn once, write anywhere.

116
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.160
So it's not write once,
run anywhere, right?

117
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.890
That's kind of the pipe
dream in my opinion.

118
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.890
That's never gonna really truly
work because you have to embrace

119
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.989
the differences of platforms.

120
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.830
But the idea that you learn one paradigm,
which is how to write react, and

121
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.610
then you can write it in
a bunch of different places.

122
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.150
An example, actually I gave a talk
in Iceland this past year about.

123
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.000
I wrote react to run in the command line,
then I wrote it to run in the browser.

124
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.379
And then I wrote it to run on an Arduino,
and then I wrote it to run in VR.

125
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.880
With relatively the similar code.

126
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.200
Right, now I had to have a different code.

127
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.990
Right, because what you write for
the command line or

128
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.370
in Arduino is very different than
what you write to run in VR.

129
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.290
However it's the same paradigms, right.

130
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.390
And something like ReactRouter could work
on potentially on all of those platforms.

131
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.070
Cuz the idea of routing is,

132
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:28.400
as long as you have some sort of URL
schema, it's gonna work almost everywhere.

133
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.170
If we go back to our homepage here,

134
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.230
we wanna make this browse all be
link rather than just be a button.

135
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.475
Before I move on,

136
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:40.062
does anyone have any questions about
anything we've talked about so far?

137
00:08:45.363 --> 00:08:53.790
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so
go back to landing real quick.

138
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.535
And up here, we're just gonna say,

139
00:08:58.535 --> 00:09:03.620
import, link, from react-router.

140
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.370
Link is a component that basically
lets us make links within our app.

141
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:16.070
And then we're going to
say link to /search.

142
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.150
We just replaced the a here
to be a link tag instead.

143
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.040
Now you could just make this an a tag and
that would work just fine, right?

144
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.810
Cuz that link would still work.

145
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:33.614
However one that won't work in react
native or anything else like that.

146
00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:35.734
And the other thing is it won't,

147
00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:39.446
if I decided to change from
browser router to hash router or

148
00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:44.170
hash router to browser router,
those links are going to change, right?

149
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.770
The URL structuring is going to change.

150
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.590
So, just use link it's
a lot easier that way.

151
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.760
It takes care of all that dirty work for
you.

152
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.440
To, I meant to put equals not space.

153
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.237
So, make sure, to make sure
that's an equal and not a space.

154
00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:09.340
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so save that.

155
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.190
Come back over here and refresh your page.

156
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.660
And now, if you look down at the bottom,
kind of hard to see down there.

157
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.880
But this is now actually like a real link.

158
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.720
So if I click browse all,
I go to the search page.

159
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.570
I can go back.

160
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.290
I can go forward.

161
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.970
I can open it in a new tab.

162
00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.190
Like, this all works like
a normal browser should.

163
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.218
So, it's good.

164
00:10:35.415 --> 00:10:37.412
&gt;&gt; Brian: Any questions about link or
anything like that?

165
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you show the code again?

166
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.530
&gt;&gt; Brian: Sure.

167
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.820
So I just imported link up here.

168
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.587
And I just did a link to, right there.

169
00:10:55.536 --> 00:10:56.640
&gt;&gt; Brian: Great.

170
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.577
So, let's go back to talking about props.

171
00:11:01.775 --> 00:11:03.410
&gt;&gt; Brian: We already talked
about them a little bit, right?

172
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.940
Cuz we did this.props.title and
this.props.color.

173
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.462
We're just gonna kind of expand on that.

174
00:11:11.365 --> 00:11:14.145
&gt;&gt; Brian: What we are gonna do is we're
gonna go back to webpack config for

175
00:11:14.145 --> 00:11:15.810
just a second.

176
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:16.540
Go ahead.

177
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quick question.

178
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.230
I think.

179
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.340
Is index route gone from version four?

180
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.328
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yes, thankfully.

181
00:11:24.037 --> 00:11:29.060
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's a v1,
v2 way of doing routes.

182
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.366
Yeah, now it's just match.

183
00:11:33.177 --> 00:11:35.000
&gt;&gt; Brian: Match and miss, I guess.

184
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.950
Match, miss, and redirect, those are
the three that you have to worry about.

185
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.400
But I think all of those make sense,
right?
