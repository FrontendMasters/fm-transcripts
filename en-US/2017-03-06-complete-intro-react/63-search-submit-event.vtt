00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:03.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's still not super
useful because we can change this input.

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.930
Congratulations, we're now writing to
Redux but it's not really doing anything.

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.840
One thing we want to be able to do is
we want to be able send ourselves to

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.820
the search page using our
little input right here.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.460
So there's a couple ways to do this.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.627
I've found the easiest way is
just to wrap this in a form real

7
00:00:20.627 --> 00:00:26.694
quick.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

8
00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:34.172
then we can just key off of the onSubmit.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you would just

9
00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:41.265
say this.handleSearchSubmit.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, and that way

10
00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:46.101
we're able to capture those submit events
just like a normal HTML form, and we can

11
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:51.401
just send them off to the search page.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

12
00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:57.138
what we do here is now we're
gonna have a handleSearchSubmit,

13
00:00:57.138 --> 00:01:00.072
which is going to take an event.

14
00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:05.570
The first thing we're gonna do
with that event is preventDefault.

15
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.650
I'm sure many of you
have seen that before.

16
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.640
But it is a form, if you actually don't
prevent it from submitting, it's going

17
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.600
to try and actually navigate the page for
you, so you don't wanna do that.

18
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.430
That's where
the preventDefault() comes in.

19
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.690
This is just like normal browser stuff,
right, this isn't React specific.

20
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.460
But then, what we want to do is we want to
basically change the navigation to go to

21
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.804
the search page, right.

22
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.942
Well, React Router has a way of doing it,
but it's kind of, well it's a new concept

23
00:01:38.942 --> 00:01:45.179
that I have to show you how to do it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we've been talking

24
00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.630
about props and state, which you're
gonna use props and state all the time.

25
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.030
Those are absolutely core
concepts to React and Redux.

26
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.910
There's a third one that
we haven't talked about.

27
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.790
And the reason why we haven't
talked about it is it's

28
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.300
definitely what one calls a foot gun,
right?

29
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.000
It's definitely a way that you
can shoot yourself in the foot.

30
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.405
And it's called context.

31
00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:14.403
Now the first thing I'll tell you that
me having written React for a long time,

32
00:02:14.403 --> 00:02:17.140
I have never written directly to context.

33
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.090
Like I don't use context myself,

34
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.610
however some of the libraries I
use use context, and that's okay.

35
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.450
So suffice to say that a library
using context is an acceptable use.

36
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.180
And I'm going to go ahead and assert with
some controversy, so take my opinion as

37
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.830
some grain of salt, that you should
not write to context, period, right.

38
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.310
If you're writing to context,
you should probably just move to Redux.

39
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.840
Okay, so why is props and
Redux and state different?

40
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.330
Right, so we know states and
props, but what's context?

41
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.560
Context is available everywhere
inside of your React app.

42
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.840
So it's almost Redux like in that sense,
that if you write to context in this

43
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.630
component, and this component way over
here is reading from the same context.

44
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.297
So it's essentially a global for your app.

45
00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:17.426
Now if that doesn't sound like a foot gun
to you, I don't know what's wrong with

46
00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:21.080
you, because it definitely
sounds like a foot gun, right.

47
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.520
Like this is an easy way to really confuse
what's going on in your app, right.

48
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.500
Cuz I've talked about all the great
reasons that React is super debuggable.

49
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.293
And you know where everything is
happening and why it's super great.

50
00:03:33.293 --> 00:03:35.141
And that's,
in a particular sense in context,

51
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:36.950
just throws all of that out the window,
right.

52
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.387
Because if I modify over here and
then I start having a problem over here,

53
00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:45.556
I have no clue that the problem was
actually over here to begin with.

54
00:03:45.556 --> 00:03:48.250
So does that make sense,
like what context is?

55
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.380
So it's actually made to be pretty
difficult to modify context and

56
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.570
to read from context.

57
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.835
It's a specific act or opt-in process and

58
00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:04.470
the way that they do that to you is
they actually make you do context types.

59
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.690
But the difference is, so if,
if we don't put a prop type for

60
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.410
something, it still shows up in props,
right?

61
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.460
If we don't put a context type for
something, it doesn't show up in context.

62
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.490
So you actually have to opt in and say,
I'm expecting this to come from context

63
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.170
and it must be this type,
or it's not gonna show up.

64
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.862
So, I feel like that's the React team
admitting that this is a foot gun, so

65
00:04:29.862 --> 00:04:32.607
make sure you are opting
into your foot gun.

66
00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:38.282
[LAUGH] Okay, so all of that said, when we
wrapped our entire app with React Router,

67
00:04:38.282 --> 00:04:42.985
with the browser router, the way
that the browser router actually is

68
00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:46.825
working internally is it
sticks its router on context.

69
00:04:46.825 --> 00:04:49.670
And then all the different components
read from that same router.

70
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.020
Well, we can read from the same router
as well, so let's go ahead and do that.

71
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.793
So we're gonna add a context type,
so I put very first thing context

72
00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:04.230
type because I want all future
people to know is, holy shit,

73
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.173
they're using context here, and
just have that flashing neon sign at

74
00:05:09.173 --> 00:05:14.145
the top.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

75
00:05:14.145 --> 00:05:15.749
we're going to pull off the router,

76
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:21.167
which is going to be an object.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

77
00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:23.180
we also need to import
that from prop types.

78
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.758
Now I'm fine saying that router is
an object, and just that, because

79
00:05:29.758 --> 00:05:35.819
I don't maintain the router, so I don't
really care to describe the shape of it.

80
00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.032
So I'm just happy to say

81
00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:41.816
that that's an object.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

82
00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:47.506
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

83
00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:54.321
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What we're gonna

84
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:58.369
do here is then we're gonna say

85
00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:06.633
this.context.router.transitionTo('/searc-
h').

86
00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:15.202
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is the way that you

87
00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:17.992
programmatically navigate
with React Router.

88
00:06:23.573 --> 00:06:25.001
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about this?

89
00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:34.519
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so

90
00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:40.943
let's go make sure that actually works.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Refresh.

91
00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:43.676
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know why my dev

92
00:06:43.676 --> 00:06:45.890
tools are having such a hard time today,
but whatever.

93
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.774
So now I'm gonna say house and
if I hit enter,

94
00:06:51.774 --> 00:07:00.680
it navigates me to search.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any

95
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.721
questions while I push
up a branch real quick?

96
00:07:14.173 --> 00:07:15.366
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it possible to do

97
00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:21.894
the navigation in a reducer?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

98
00:07:21.894 --> 00:07:26.042
I think ultimately what you're getting at,
indirectly, or whether or

99
00:07:26.042 --> 00:07:31.710
not you realize that you're getting at, is
can you have your routing done by Redux?

100
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.100
The answer is there is
a thing called Redux router,

101
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.990
which is ultimately a thin
wrapper on top of a React Router.

102
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.320
So, if you're into that, I really don't
know anything more about it than that cuz

103
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.870
I've never used it, but it does exist.

104
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.920
It's a separate library
maintained by the same people.

105
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.400
But ultimately it's using
React Router at its core.

106
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.213
And I also am not sure that they've
written a v4 branch yet, so I think that's

107
00:07:58.213 --> 00:08:03.303
stuck on the older React Router for now.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, Francois is asking,

108
00:08:03.303 --> 00:08:08.158
so you gave us this big warning
about context, is what you are doing

109
00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:10.848
the common way of doing it?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I mean,

110
00:08:10.848 --> 00:08:15.230
this is the way you have to
do it with React Router v4.

111
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.449
So like I said, if a library I
use integrates with contexts,

112
00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:22.880
then I'm okay using context for that.

113
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.400
But I personally never
write to context myself.
