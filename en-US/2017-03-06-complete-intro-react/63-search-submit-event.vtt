00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:03.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's still not super
useful because we can change this input.

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.930
Congratulations, we're now writing to
Redux but it's not really doing anything.

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.840
One thing we want to be able to do is
we want to be able send ourselves to

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.820
the search page using our
little input right here.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.460
So there's a couple ways to do this.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.065
I've found the easiest way is just
to wrap this in a form real quick.

7
00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:28.869
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then we can just key off of the onSubmit.

8
00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:37.393
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you would just
say this.handleSearchSubmit.

9
00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:43.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, and that way we're
able to capture those submit events

10
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.360
just like a normal HTML form, and we can
just send them off to the search page.

11
00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:57.138
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what we do here is now
we're gonna have a handleSearchSubmit,

12
00:00:57.138 --> 00:01:00.072
which is going to take an event.

13
00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:05.570
The first thing we're gonna do
with that event is preventDefault.

14
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.650
I'm sure many of you
have seen that before.

15
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.640
But it is a form, if you actually don't
prevent it from submitting, it's going

16
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.600
to try and actually navigate the page for
you, so you don't wanna do that.

17
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.430
That's where
the preventDefault() comes in.

18
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.690
This is just like normal browser stuff,
right, this isn't React specific.

19
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.460
But then, what we want to do is we want to
basically change the navigation to go to

20
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.804
the search page, right.

21
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.397
Well, React Router has a way of doing it,
but it's kind of,

22
00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:41.196
well it's a new concept that I
have to show you how to do it.

23
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:46.546
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we've been talking about props and state,

24
00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:49.630
which you're gonna use props and
state all the time.

25
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.030
Those are absolutely core
concepts to React and Redux.

26
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.910
There's a third one that
we haven't talked about.

27
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.790
And the reason why we haven't
talked about it is it's

28
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.300
definitely what one calls a foot gun,
right?

29
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.000
It's definitely a way that you
can shoot yourself in the foot.

30
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.405
And it's called context.

31
00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:14.403
Now the first thing I'll tell you that
me having written React for a long time,

32
00:02:14.403 --> 00:02:17.140
I have never written directly to context.

33
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.090
Like I don't use context myself,

34
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.610
however some of the libraries I
use use context, and that's okay.

35
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.450
So suffice to say that a library
using context is an acceptable use.

36
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.180
And I'm going to go ahead and assert with
some controversy, so take my opinion as

37
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.830
some grain of salt, that you should
not write to context, period, right.

38
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.310
If you're writing to context,
you should probably just move to Redux.

39
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.840
Okay, so why is props and
Redux and state different?

40
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.330
Right, so we know states and
props, but what's context?

41
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.560
Context is available everywhere
inside of your React app.

42
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.840
So it's almost Redux like in that sense,
that if you write to context in this

43
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.630
component, and this component way over
here is reading from the same context.

44
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.297
So it's essentially a global for your app.

45
00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:17.426
Now if that doesn't sound like a foot gun
to you, I don't know what's wrong with

46
00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:21.080
you, because it definitely
sounds like a foot gun, right.

47
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.520
Like this is an easy way to really confuse
what's going on in your app, right.

48
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.500
Cuz I've talked about all the great
reasons that React is super debuggable.

49
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.293
And you know where everything is
happening and why it's super great.

50
00:03:33.293 --> 00:03:35.141
And that's,
in a particular sense in context,

51
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:36.950
just throws all of that out the window,
right.

52
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.387
Because if I modify over here and
then I start having a problem over here,

53
00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:45.556
I have no clue that the problem was
actually over here to begin with.

54
00:03:45.556 --> 00:03:48.250
So does that make sense,
like what context is?

55
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.380
So it's actually made to be pretty
difficult to modify context and

56
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.570
to read from context.

57
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.835
It's a specific act or opt-in process and

58
00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:04.470
the way that they do that to you is
they actually make you do context types.

59
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.690
But the difference is, so if,
if we don't put a prop type for

60
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.410
something, it still shows up in props,
right?

61
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.460
If we don't put a context type for
something, it doesn't show up in context.

62
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.490
So you actually have to opt in and say,
I'm expecting this to come from context

63
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.170
and it must be this type,
or it's not gonna show up.

64
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.862
So, I feel like that's the React team
admitting that this is a foot gun, so

65
00:04:29.862 --> 00:04:32.607
make sure you are opting
into your foot gun.

66
00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:38.282
[LAUGH] Okay, so all of that said, when we
wrapped our entire app with React Router,

67
00:04:38.282 --> 00:04:42.985
with the browser router, the way
that the browser router actually is

68
00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:46.825
working internally is it
sticks its router on context.

69
00:04:46.825 --> 00:04:49.670
And then all the different components
read from that same router.

70
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.020
Well, we can read from the same router
as well, so let's go ahead and do that.

71
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.793
So we're gonna add a context type,
so I put very first thing context

72
00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:04.230
type because I want all future
people to know is, holy shit,

73
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.886
they're using context here, and just
have that flashing neon sign at the top.

74
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.749
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we're going to pull off the router,

75
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.105
which is going to be an object.

76
00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:23.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we also need
to import that from prop types.

77
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.758
Now I'm fine saying that router is
an object, and just that, because

78
00:05:29.758 --> 00:05:35.819
I don't maintain the router, so I don't
really care to describe the shape of it.

79
00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.311
So I'm just happy to say
that that's an object.

80
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:41.816
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

81
00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:52.608
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What

82
00:05:52.608 --> 00:05:58.369
we're gonna do here is
then we're gonna say

83
00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:06.633
this.context.router.transitionTo('/searc-
h').

84
00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:17.102
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is the way that
you programmatically navigate with

85
00:06:17.102 --> 00:06:17.992
React Router.

86
00:06:23.573 --> 00:06:25.001
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about this?

87
00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so
let's go make sure that actually works.

88
00:06:39.903 --> 00:06:40.943
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Refresh.

89
00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.265
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know why my dev
tools are having such a hard time today,

90
00:06:45.265 --> 00:06:45.890
but whatever.

91
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:54.379
So now I'm gonna say house and
if I hit enter, it navigates me to search.

92
00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:02.721
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions while
I push up a branch real quick?

93
00:07:14.173 --> 00:07:17.236
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it possible to
do the navigation in a reducer?

94
00:07:21.758 --> 00:07:25.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I think ultimately
what you're getting at, indirectly, or

95
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.422
whether or
not you realize that you're getting at,

96
00:07:28.422 --> 00:07:31.710
is can you have your
routing done by Redux?

97
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.100
The answer is there is
a thing called Redux router,

98
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.990
which is ultimately a thin
wrapper on top of a React Router.

99
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.320
So, if you're into that, I really don't
know anything more about it than that cuz

100
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.870
I've never used it, but it does exist.

101
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.920
It's a separate library
maintained by the same people.

102
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.400
But ultimately it's using
React Router at its core.

103
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.891
And I also am not sure that
they've written a v4 branch yet,

104
00:07:56.891 --> 00:08:01.222
so I think that's stuck on
the older React Router for now.

105
00:08:01.222 --> 00:08:05.904
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, Francois is asking,
so you gave us this big warning about

106
00:08:05.904 --> 00:08:10.168
context, is what you are doing
the common way of doing it?

107
00:08:10.168 --> 00:08:15.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I mean, this is the way
you have to do it with React Router v4.

108
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.449
So like I said, if a library I
use integrates with contexts,

109
00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:22.880
then I'm okay using context for that.

110
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.400
But I personally never
write to context myself.
