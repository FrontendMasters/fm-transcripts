00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Welcome back to day
two of complete intro to react.

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.940
Hopefully melted your minds
a little bit more, but

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.290
today is full of more of the fun stuff.

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.790
We did kind of more the basic building
blocks of React, the basic tooling around

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.600
it, and now we get to go off and
do some of the more crazy fun things.

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.340
And I'm just gonna kinda give
you some highlight reels of,

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.320
like, some of my favorite things
to do with React, but obviously,

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.620
like when we give you
interesting new primitives to

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.630
build interesting things with,
I mean, the world is your oyster.

10
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.800
[LAUGH] Yeah, it's only your
imagination that limits you.

11
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.862
Before we get started,

12
00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:43.662
does anyone have any questions they
wanted to pose before we kept going?

13
00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.706
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As
a reminder we're on V2-12.

14
00:00:52.706 --> 00:00:54.680
And I'll keep pushing
branches throughout today.

15
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.860
So as you can see here,
I have our class page up.

16
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.910
That's nho.lt/react,
if you don't have the link.

17
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.745
And we're about half way down the page,
little over half.

18
00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:12.390
And we're gonna start with data in React.

19
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:19.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we had just finished
up kind of the unit testing part.

20
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.203
We just finished up our little
note on Hot Module Reload, and

21
00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:27.375
we're gonna go back and
start working some more in React, and

22
00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:32.829
we're gonna add another route today,
our last route, which is going to be kinda

23
00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.231
like the details you can zoom in like in
YouTube trailers you can get a synopsis.

24
00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:44.551
Let's go back to the window.

25
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:52.440
Create a new file called details.js
I'm wanna put that instead of JS and

26
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.242
save,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

27
00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:01.872
here we're gonna say
import React from react,

28
00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:07.558
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Const Details

29
00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:13.695
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Equals react.create class,

30
00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:18.844
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Render,

31
00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:22.211
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Return,

32
00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:26.416
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And whatever you

33
00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:27.307
wanna put here.

34
00:02:33.803 --> 00:02:39.979
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And export default details.

35
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:48.195
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,
come back over to clientapp.js.

36
00:02:50.354 --> 00:02:53.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we're just gonna make a new route here.

37
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.460
So we're gonna import details up here,
import details from ./details.

38
00:03:02.206 --> 00:03:08.888
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
make a new match component

39
00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:14.767
down here, match pattern

40
00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:19.311
= /details/:id

41
00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:24.679
component =details.

42
00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:27.670
So this :id I imagine that for

43
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.250
many of you that have written service
head apps looks mildly familiar.

44
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.539
But if it's not basically you're saying,
I'm wanna route that,

45
00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.635
I'm gonna have the details,
particular path.

46
00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:39.217
And then,

47
00:03:39.217 --> 00:03:43.560
whatever comes after that is going to be
the ID of whatever you're looking for.

48
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.430
So if you have like just in this
particular case we have our movies.

49
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.120
So that ID is going to correspond
to whatever movie we're looking at.

50
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.890
So that details parameter is going
to be passed to our route and

51
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.040
we can select the correct
movie to show them.

52
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.710
That make sense?

53
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.710
Cool.

54
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.425
This is a very common pattern this
is how you do it with Django.

55
00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:07.850
It's how you do it with a bunch
of different server side routing.

56
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.917
So they kinda just don't
let the flow in that.

57
00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:15.159
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

58
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.740
So let's just go make sure that works.

59
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.630
So save that.

60
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.940
Make sure your dev serve is running.

61
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.600
Mine is not.

62
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.650
So I'm gonna do npm run dev.

63
00:04:28.396 --> 00:04:29.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Wait for it to build.

64
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.980
Cool.

65
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.761
Bundles now valid.

66
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Come back here.

67
00:04:38.857 --> 00:04:43.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I'm just gonna
URL hack to details/block, whatever.

68
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.775
And I got an error.

69
00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:53.846
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

70
00:04:59.183 --> 00:05:00.941
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Details such as

71
00:05:15.284 --> 00:05:16.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I bet you
this is a path issue.

72
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.272
It's always a path issue.

73
00:05:28.071 --> 00:05:31.567
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure I have
all the code that I'm expecting.

74
00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is everyone else
seeing the same thing I am.

75
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.160
Obviously must have messed something
up here, so let's dig into this.

76
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.830
Details, let's go back to client apps.

77
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.450
It's gonna be something
wrong with her router.

78
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.320
We have a match here.

79
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.220
Pattern details equals that and
component equals details,

80
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.950
that should be just fine as is.

81
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.826
So let's just make sure
details is a real component,

82
00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:06.541
that's always something
you always wanna check.

83
00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.857
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's not it,
that's interesting.

84
00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:30.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if we look at network,
we're not even getting bundle.

85
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.889
New is gonna be a patters.

86
00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.130
We're getting a four of four here, so
it's gonna be details/pebblesite bundle.

87
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.507
So I'm pretty sure that means, index.HTML.

88
00:06:40.507 --> 00:06:42.526
This probably needs to be /public.

89
00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:48.421
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

90
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.580
So to recap.

91
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.210
Go back to your index.HTML.

92
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.890
Make sure that is /public/bundle.js.

93
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:05.060
We needed that leading slash because it
was looking for details/public/bundle.js.

94
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.510
In reality, we want it to look for /.

95
00:07:10.548 --> 00:07:11.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We want it
to go straight to the root.

96
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.720
We don't want it to look
in a relative directory.

97
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.220
So just gonna say it, again, cuz you're
gonna have a really bad time writing this.

98
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.513
Make sure your script here
has /public/bundle.js.

99
00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:35.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We can
rid of that log in there

100
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.010
in the ClientApp, cool.

101
00:07:43.803 --> 00:07:47.892
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
[COUH] now go back to your details,

102
00:07:47.892 --> 00:07:52.055
.js
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm going

103
00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:56.760
to do that pre-code thing that I
showed you earlier, so pre code.

104
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.555
We just wanna look at what React
router actually passes the route.

105
00:08:01.555 --> 00:08:06.071
JSON.stringify cuz it passes
you quite a bit of data.

106
00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:09.784
this.props, null and 4.

107
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now if we refresh
here again, it's hard to read.

108
00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:25.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
you can see here it's passing quite a bit.

109
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.594
But the most interesting thing is here,
it has params.

110
00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.520
This is hard to read, hold on a sec.

111
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:39.301
If I just put a div out
here with className

112
00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:45.905
='details'
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just move that inside.

113
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:52.636
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This will
make it easier to read,

114
00:08:52.636 --> 00:08:56.170
cuz you'll have some CSS behind it or
is a background.

115
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.854
So just encapsulate this in a div.

116
00:09:03.818 --> 00:09:07.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Save that.

117
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.552
Come back over here.

118
00:09:09.552 --> 00:09:10.880
Now, it's a little bit easier to read.

119
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:17.180
So the most interesting part is you
have params and you have an ID.

120
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.310
And that gets passed right here.

121
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.150
So whatever is up here in your
URL kinda hard to see, but

122
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.820
I promise this thing and
this one right there are the same thing.

123
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.504
But you can also see there's this
location, the isExact match was true.

124
00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:33.360
You can see which pattern it matched.

125
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.889
There's a bunch of information that the
router just gives to you automatically, so

126
00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:39.119
that's good to know.

127
00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:45.388
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

128
00:09:46.543 --> 00:09:49.617
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So most importantly this
is when we're gonna actually manipulating

129
00:09:49.617 --> 00:09:50.630
right here is this ID.
