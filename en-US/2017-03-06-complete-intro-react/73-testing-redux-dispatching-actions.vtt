00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That was
a fairly easy one to fix.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.266
These get progressively a little bit
tougher to fix each time because they have

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:14.743
more and more dependency on Redux.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

4
00:00:14.743 --> 00:00:17.962
one thing that you'll probably
just notice from this

5
00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:22.690
is that as soon as we integrate Redux,
it makes React a lot harder to test.

6
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.466
Yeah, go ahead?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What was that thing you did

7
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:29.737
to get rid of the Babel cache?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: --no-cache.

8
00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:37.272
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We have to fake out Redux.

9
00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:39.608
[LAUGH] We have to make
Redux think it's there.

10
00:00:39.608 --> 00:00:43.252
So what we're actually gonna do,
is we're gonna import Provider,

11
00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:48.948
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From react-redux, and

12
00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:53.196
we're going to import down here,

13
00:00:55.805 --> 00:01:01.326
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: store from ./store, okay?

14
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.217
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're also gonna

15
00:01:14.217 --> 00:01:17.365
have to import from our action creators.

16
00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:18.654
import,

17
00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:29.049
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: setSearchTerm from

18
00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.772
./actionCreators.

19
00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:40.755
And in addition to getting shallow, we're
also going to grab render now because we

20
00:01:40.755 --> 00:01:44.827
need that extra depth to get this to
work the way that we expect it to.

21
00:01:55.962 --> 00:01:56.551
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

22
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:58.542
come back to your second test and

23
00:01:58.542 --> 00:02:02.424
uncomment that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just have to make

24
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:03.733
this a little bit more robust now.

25
00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:15.013
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry.

26
00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:19.885
Does this one work already?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or did I just not

27
00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:21.658
include the things to make that work?

28
00:02:30.632 --> 00:02:35.458
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Search is not defined.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,

29
00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:37.068
we'll leave this one comment out for
a second.

30
00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:39.906
And we're gonna go onto the third one,

31
00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:44.382
cuz that's the one I have up
here that we've been working on.

32
00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:50.314
So search house = 'house', and
what we're going to do here, let's just,

33
00:02:58.513 --> 00:03:00.016
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna do

34
00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:06.671
store.dispatch,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: setSearchTerm to

35
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:12.591
be searchWord.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

36
00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:18.027
or do const component = render, okay?

37
00:03:18.027 --> 00:03:19.859
And then we have to wrap it with Provider,
right?

38
00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.194
Because otherwise,
Provider's not gonna be there.

39
00:03:23.194 --> 00:03:29.924
store ={store}.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

40
00:03:29.924 --> 00:03:39.563
&lt;Search),
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: &lt;Search,

41
00:03:39.563 --> 00:03:44.612
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: shows,

42
00:03:47.412 --> 00:03:49.378
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: ={preload.shows},

43
00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.321
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And &lt;/Provider&gt;, okay?

44
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:05.929
So that's gonna get us our component.

45
00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.250
Then we're gonna do const showCount.

46
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:17.302
We'll come down here, grab this.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's all well and

47
00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:20.039
good.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

48
00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.890
then this expect down here.

49
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.030
We're gonna bring this up here.

50
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.808
Unfortunately, we can't do the ShowCard
trick anymore, so that's not gonna work.

51
00:04:28.808 --> 00:04:32.368
So we're just gonna give it
the class that we're gonna look for

52
00:04:32.368 --> 00:04:34.261
in CSS, which is .show-card.

53
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:35.463
Not bad, but

54
00:04:35.463 --> 00:04:41.407
not quite as nice as it used to be.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's

55
00:04:41.407 --> 00:04:45.397
providing search?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

56
00:04:45.397 --> 00:04:46.587
you need to import that, as well.

57
00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:55.198
So you need to grab it from here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Think that works.

58
00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure that works.

59
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.444
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Doesn't that have to be

60
00:05:05.444 --> 00:05:05.982
inside?

61
00:05:15.472 --> 00:05:17.539
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Preloads are not defined.

62
00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:18.998
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

63
00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:20.247
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Your preloads?

64
00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:25.090
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right there,

65
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.505
okay?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

66
00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:34.730
so the answer is, no,
this doesn't have to be in inside.

67
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.010
Because this is the default
that we're grabbing, right?

68
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.040
These are named imports.

69
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:49.405
This is the default import.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

70
00:05:49.405 --> 00:05:56.745
that makes that test pass.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one,

71
00:05:56.745 --> 00:05:59.686
do I just need to change
this to unwrapped?

72
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.591
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: &lt;UnwrappedSearch

73
00:06:05.591 --> 00:06:10.260
searchTerm= ' ' blank.

74
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.375
And

75
00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:21.335
shows={preload.shows}.

76
00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:22.888
This probably should still work.

77
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.089
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, that's all you need to

78
00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:40.361
do, so, all of that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, like I said, this makes

79
00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:46.573
React a lot harder to test because it's
harder to pull apart Redux and React.

80
00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:49.927
They come a little bit more
married than they used to be.

81
00:06:49.927 --> 00:06:51.371
Well, they used to be not married at all,
but

82
00:06:51.371 --> 00:06:52.860
it used to be a little
bit easier to test React.

83
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.268
But we're still relatively
testing the same thing.

84
00:07:00.268 --> 00:07:03.589
Whilst it gets a little bit harder,
this still is not awful, right?

85
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:11.570
It's still not bad.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

86
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.808
here, we're just dispatching an action,
externally,

87
00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:20.395
to the store, and then we're
just testing the result of that.
