00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
let's go to search.js, but

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.740
I don't think we've finished up here.

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.381
No, we didn't, sorry, go back to header.

4
00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:12.934
So we defined our prop types down here.

5
00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:15.120
And now we're actually
going to go use them.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.962
So inside of render,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're

7
00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:21.959
gonna say let utilSpace.

8
00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:29.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If this.props.showSearch,

9
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:37.365
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: utilSpace = input.

10
00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:42.154
In fact,
you can just go grab it from search.js.

11
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.807
So go grab this input real quick,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From search.js,

12
00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:55.359
and then go back to header.js and
just paste that in there.

13
00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.946
Except the only difference is
onChange is gonna come from

14
00:00:58.946 --> 00:01:02.260
this.props.handleSearchTermChange.

15
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.976
And that is going to come
from this.props.searchTerm.

16
00:01:10.422 --> 00:01:16.517
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Else utilSpace = and
we're gonna make it so

17
00:01:16.517 --> 00:01:20.636
on the search page it's gonna

18
00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:25.590
show,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This input.

19
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.086
And then on the details page,
we're gonna put a back button so

20
00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:29.295
you can go back to the search.

21
00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:34.501
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we're just gonna put an h2.

22
00:01:38.237 --> 00:01:39.449
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't think I need that.

23
00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:47.883
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Link to='/search'&gt;.

24
00:01:50.803 --> 00:01:51.557
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Back.

25
00:01:57.424 --> 00:01:58.229
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

26
00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.077
So now, we have this utilSpace,

27
00:02:00.077 --> 00:02:04.370
which is this variable containing one
of two different components, right?

28
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.158
So we can actually just come
down here to the header.

29
00:02:08.158 --> 00:02:15.126
And right after the h1,
just say output whatever's in utilSpace.

30
00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:20.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that make sense?

31
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.120
It's just saying dump out this component,
whatever component this utilSpace has

32
00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.087
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions?

33
00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:38.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How do we avoid
having to copy and paste the input?

34
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.556
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What do you
mean how do you avoid?

35
00:02:42.556 --> 00:02:45.664
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: By having to
write out the input box.

36
00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:49.764
Again, essentially can we
reuse it from one location?

37
00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:51.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this is exactly what we're doing.

38
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.278
We're abstracting it out of search, and
then we're going to delete it in search.

39
00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:55.242
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: From there, okay.

40
00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:55.742
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

41
00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:01.819
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
we're doing it precisely so

42
00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.867
we don't have to repeat ourselves, so
we have exactly one source of truth.

43
00:03:10.905 --> 00:03:14.882
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so now Header
can handle both the search page and

44
00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:19.036
the details page, so
let's go put it on the search page.

45
00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:24.486
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
here where it says header, well,

46
00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:26.550
first of all let's import it.

47
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.122
So we're gonna say import
Header from './Header'.

48
00:03:36.164 --> 00:03:41.455
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here where it
says header, we're gonna say Header,

49
00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:45.126
but we need to give it
a couple more things.

50
00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:49.822
So we need to give it showSearch,

51
00:03:49.822 --> 00:03:54.687
and we need to give it searchTerm=

52
00:03:54.687 --> 00:03:58.910
this.state.searchTerm.

53
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.343
And we need to give it
handleSearchTermChange,

54
00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:09.250
which is this.handleSearchTermChange.

55
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.777
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So people get kinda tripped
up on showSearch with no parameter.

56
00:04:27.777 --> 00:04:32.419
This is exactly the same as saying,
showSearch = true.

57
00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.349
But if you just leave it off the =
true is implied, so just leave it off.

58
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.089
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions?

59
00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you go back to Header?

60
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

61
00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:00.506
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Scroll down.

62
00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:01.457
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I can't scroll down.

63
00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.588
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just a quick question, you
are gonna cover immutable this afternoon?

64
00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:18.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope.

65
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.208
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're not, no state stuff?

66
00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:22.172
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like immutable JS?

67
00:05:22.172 --> 00:05:23.283
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

68
00:05:23.283 --> 00:05:24.133
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I like immutable,

69
00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:26.956
but it's outside of the scope of
what I wanna talk about today.

70
00:05:26.956 --> 00:05:29.556
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, sorry.

71
00:05:29.556 --> 00:05:30.439
You like it though, right?

72
00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.734
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's cool,
no, it's amazing.

73
00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:36.903
It's kind of heavy handed,
I don't wanna say heavy handed, but

74
00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:38.350
it's just a heavy library.

75
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.023
They're asking if you can go
back to the search file, please.

76
00:05:54.757 --> 00:05:57.463
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, yeah, cool.

77
00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:02.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let me go make sure this actually works.

78
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.376
Refresh, I gotta do this all the time,
npm run dev.

79
00:06:10.376 --> 00:06:12.130
Let's just split that.

80
00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:23.509
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, refresh
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

81
00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.879
so now notice on our details page,

82
00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:31.700
we have a nice little back button up here,
which takes us back to search.

83
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.944
Now, if we go back to search,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can still type House of

84
00:06:35.944 --> 00:06:38.531
Cards, it's all abstracted out and
it still works.

85
00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:42.660
Despite the fact that all of the display
logic has moved into the header.

86
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.190
It's still interacting the same way.
