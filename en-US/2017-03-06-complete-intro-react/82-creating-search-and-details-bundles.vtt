WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:02.901
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, let's just go
ahead and finish the other two.

2
00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:05.840
They're the two routes on app.js.

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.080
So get rid of Search and Details up here.

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.380
We don't need those anymore.

5
00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:16.041
And we must remove those otherwise webpack
isn't included in the initial bundle and

6
00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:17.301
we don't wanna do that.

7
00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:21.543
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
all we're gonna do here.

8
00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:38.167
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is already that so

9
00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:42.270
we're just gonna change
this to br AsyncRoute.

10
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:53.314
We're gonna do AsyncRoute props=,

11
00:00:56.788 --> 00:01:00.449
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Object.assign,

12
00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.104
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: shows: preload.shows,

13
00:01:15.104 --> 00:01:16.916
props.

14
00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:21.102
So we wanna pass everything
that we got from here, but

15
00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:23.810
we also want to include our shows.

16
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.166
That's what that object assigned is for,
and

17
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:33.305
then we're gonna do a loadingPromise,
which is going

18
00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:38.528
to be System.import,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: ./,

19
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.719
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Details?

20
00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:42.744
No, Search.

21
00:01:51.332 --> 00:01:52.065
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

22
00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.904
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I mean at this
point this is getting kinda crazy.

23
00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:05.772
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you might break
this on the multiple lines.

24
00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:12.866
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.

25
00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:17.861
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Up to you.

26
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:21.283
It's kinda weird spacing,

27
00:02:21.283 --> 00:02:25.990
you could fix that however you want to.

28
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.120
So let's go make sure that,
that still works.

29
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What is that?

30
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.811
Unexpected space between function name and
paren.

31
00:02:41.464 --> 00:02:44.898
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right there.

32
00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.001
Are you happy, Linter?

33
00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:52.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

34
00:02:56.867 --> 00:03:01.941
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here,
we're gonna do something relatively

35
00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:06.459
similar instead of
returning details though.

36
00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.437
We're going to return

37
00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:20.086
AsyncRoute props=Object.assign,

38
00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:23.760
show: show0,

39
00:03:28.824 --> 00:03:30.331
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: props.

40
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:44.699
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
loadingPromise=System.import./Details.

41
00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:53.717
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

42
00:03:56.544 --> 00:03:59.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So app.js,
we don't need BrowserRouter anymore.

43
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:10.335
And here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 30 and 31.

44
00:04:16.702 --> 00:04:17.907
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, this should be shows.

45
00:04:24.238 --> 00:04:26.512
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

46
00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:27.485
Now, let's.

47
00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:48.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now we have three different bundles.

48
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.084
We have bundle.js, which is the big one.

49
00:04:50.084 --> 00:04:54.882
We have 2.bundle.js, we have 1.bundle.js,
and we have 0.bundle.js,

50
00:04:54.882 --> 00:04:57.460
right, which is one bundle for each route.

51
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.188
So if we go to the homepage, you need to
go to 50/50 now cuz I've changed back.

52
00:05:07.188 --> 00:05:12.840
[COUGH] We're gonna get bundle.js,
we're gonna get 2.bundle.js,

53
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.287
we're gonna go to Browse All,
we get 0.bundle.js and

54
00:05:17.287 --> 00:05:21.101
then we go to details and
we get 1.bundle.js.

55
00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:28.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If we refresh the page, we
only get bundle.js and just 1.bundle.js.

56
00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:36.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hoo,
any questions about that?

57
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.090
It's a roller coaster.

58
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.370
So there's some complexity in splitting
up your bundles into different pieces.

59
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.690
But with it's not terrible.

60
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.868
The one gotcha, I'm gonna point out
to people that they don't realize.

61
00:05:48.868 --> 00:05:52.960
This must be a string that
you pass to System.import for

62
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.629
webpack to be able to recognize this is a.

63
00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:01.175
So I can't even say var x or

64
00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:06.561
var pathName = ./Landing.

65
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.460
And say pathName right here.

66
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.400
This doesn't work.

67
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.880
And the reason is the way that webpack
does this is via static analysis.

68
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.640
It's not actually executing your code,
all it's doing is saying, okay,

69
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.980
I see a System.import with a string here,
I'm gonna pull this out.

70
00:06:27.668 --> 00:06:32.318
So, static analyzes, you can't make that
dynamic in any nature, it must be static.

71
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:36.502
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that make sense?

72
00:06:40.305 --> 00:06:47.348
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any other questions
about specifically code splitting?

73
00:06:47.348 --> 00:06:48.809
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you scroll
down just a little bit more?

74
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:59.151
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, we could break
this up into multiple lines, too.

75
00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:21.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah, notice that
we're doing server-side rendering.

76
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.700
This still works fine.

77
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.380
I can turn this off.

78
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.956
I can do it without server-side rendering.

79
00:07:28.956 --> 00:07:33.170
[COUGH] It makes no difference to react or
webpack for that matter.
