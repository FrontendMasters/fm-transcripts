WEBVTT

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.510
&gt;&gt; Brian: So here,

2
00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.980
inside of our webpack.config,
what we're gonna do is really anywhere.

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.440
As long as the top level config here,
I'm just gonna put it here before resolve.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.921
I'm gonna say, devServer.

5
00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:26.020
&gt;&gt; Brian: And I'm gonna say publicPath.

6
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.170
That doesn't need to be in quotes,

7
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.090
colon, /public/.

8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.030
So, basically what your identifying
to your devServer is like hey,

9
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.220
when someone asks for the,
like the CSS file and all that stuff.

10
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.466
That's all located in public.

11
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.660
This is kinda setting up your static
file serving, if that makes sense.

12
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.812
You're just identifying to webpack
what's the static directory.

13
00:01:01.247 --> 00:01:06.294
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so
that's all we did is we just added this.

14
00:01:06.294 --> 00:01:12.180
And now, go to package.json.

15
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.840
You could globally install
webpack dev server, but

16
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.678
it's already in your node module so
let's just make that work as is.

17
00:01:20.678 --> 00:01:24.237
So all we need to do is say dev.

18
00:01:24.237 --> 00:01:32.426
Oops
&gt;&gt; Brian: Dev:webpack-dev-server.

19
00:01:38.674 --> 00:01:39.459
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

20
00:01:40.718 --> 00:01:42.459
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
it just added this line right here.

21
00:01:47.772 --> 00:01:49.640
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now, go back to your iTerm.

22
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.831
Close your watch statement and
say npm run dev.

23
00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:02.205
&gt;&gt; Brian: You gotta wait for it,
it's gonna give you a bunch of output.

24
00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:06.835
And everything that it built which is
mostly coming from React as you can see.

25
00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:13.905
And it says, bundle in now valid,
so everything is working well.

26
00:02:13.905 --> 00:02:18.820
You can also see up here
at the top it says,

27
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.201
it's gonna be at 8080.

28
00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:30.964
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool, everything should be good.

29
00:02:30.964 --> 00:02:35.790
So now, if I go to localhost:8080.

30
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:39.885
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now, I should actually get that.

31
00:02:44.507 --> 00:02:48.230
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now, the nice thing about the
dev server is the watch statement is also

32
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.250
rolled into this.

33
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.170
So it's automatically going to rebuild
things for you on the fly as well.

34
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.340
So you don't have to be running this
separately from your watch statement,

35
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.241
it does both of them.

36
00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:02.589
&gt;&gt; Brian: There's another fun
thing that the dev server can do.

37
00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:06.167
Like one of the things that was mentioned
is, it can do hot module reload,

38
00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:08.960
which is a really interesting idea.

39
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.900
It's basically saying, first of all,
many of us are familiar

40
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.890
with CSS live reload where
whenever you update your CSS,

41
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.770
it injects it into the running page,
instead of having to refresh.

42
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.240
This takes this one step further,
and actually does it with code.

43
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.350
And says, okay, at this disconnect point,
all of this code is now invalid.

44
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.650
Rebuild this code, pull it down,
and plug it back in.

45
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.350
So you have this code being live
reloaded on the fly, or hot reloaded.

46
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.850
And you don't have to refresh the page.

47
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.812
This ends up being super useful for things
like if you're debugging a particular

48
00:03:44.812 --> 00:03:47.793
like, menu and if you click like
five menus deep to get to it.

49
00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:51.202
It's really annoying to have to do that
every single time after you refresh

50
00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:54.569
the page, or for our friend that would
have a hard time hitting command R.

51
00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.691
That shit's hard, I know.

52
00:03:56.691 --> 00:03:59.505
But yeah, so
we're not gonna do that today.

53
00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:00.370
But that is available,

54
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.150
but they're kinda rewriting it right
now and I didn't wanna talk about it.
