1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.144
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What we're gonna talk
about now is actually that primarily I

2
00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:08.236
rewrote this workshop,
the primary reason, React Router V4.

3
00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:13.590
Which is still in alpha, so this is my
big disclaimer at this point in time.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.120
Please heed my words that again,
we are using the alpha version.

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.302
I've been following the repo, I've been
bugging the maintainers, to make sure that

6
00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:27.756
the alpha is not gonna change a lot to
what the final release is gonna be.

7
00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:31.010
But this is software, stuff still changes.

8
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.010
But I've been pretty much assured that
while there might be some minor API

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.620
changes from alpha to the final release,
the concepts here are kinda universal.

10
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.400
So the one thing that I will definitely,
definitely do is on the webpage for

11
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.060
this particular workshop,
I will include an errata of like

12
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.970
here are all the things that have
changed between alpha and release.

13
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.824
So in the future when you are watching
this you can just kinda make sure, like,

14
00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.434
okay here are the things
that have changed.

15
00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:03.060
But other than that,
these should be relatively the same.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.660
Cool.

17
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.800
So React router.

18
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.170
What a tumultuous history
the React router has.

19
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.554
It's a great, great library written
by people much smarter than I am.

20
00:01:17.554 --> 00:01:23.320
But it has had API thrash,
like no one's business.

21
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.140
Like some libraries can survive going
through major re-writes like rails being

22
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.220
one of the infamous one.

23
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.620
Was it two to three that was just insane?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Two to three was

24
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.150
huge.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

25
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.905
So React router in it's two year history,

26
00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:38.894
two-ish year history has
done it like three times.

27
00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:46.519
Three times?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Two, at least twice anyway.

28
00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:49.470
And basically so there was, anyway.

29
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.370
So React Router Four is a total rewrite.

30
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.330
The entire library has
almost completely changed.

31
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.110
And everyone's kinda mad about it,
understandably so.

32
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.030
It's not fun rewriting your app but

33
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.970
I would also argue that React Router 4
got so much better that it's worth it.

34
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.750
It got so much more simple.

35
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.230
It's not kind of emulating React anymore.

36
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.030
It is actually just using React
in a good way, so I'm a fan.

37
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.344
It's cool.

38
00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:20.051
So that's what we're gonna do
now is we're actually going to

39
00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:22.342
implement React router into our app.

40
00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:26.415
And we're gonna have multiple pages
in like a single page app kind of

41
00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:32.261
faction.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So they had API

42
00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:36.480
thrash from zero to one, from one to two
slash three and from two to three to four.

43
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.362
Which is crazy, but they have assured us
that this is the last major thrash, but

44
00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.652
who knows?

45
00:02:43.652 --> 00:02:46.260
[LAUGH] Famous last words.

46
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.060
So let's move our landing
page to its own component,

47
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.290
because we're gonna make client app
actually like the routing part of our app.

48
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.400
And we're gonna make landing more of
like the actual page that goes there.

49
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.630
So go to your client app.

50
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.180
So we're gonna yank all
of this code right here,

51
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.890
so basically everything inside of app.

52
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.438
So cut, copy, however you wanna do that.

53
00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:18.010
And then, we're gonna make
a new page called landing.js.

54
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.310
Inside of the JS directory.

55
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.972
When it import React from 'react',
import React from

56
00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:33.689
'react'.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's fine,

57
00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.211
we don't need that.

58
00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:41.609
I'm gonna say const Landing
= React.createClass,

59
00:03:43.975 --> 00:03:48.322
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: render () and return that

60
00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:55.538
pasted mark-up.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

61
00:03:55.538 --> 00:03:58.158
then, export default Landing.

62
00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.451
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a question about,

63
00:04:08.451 --> 00:04:13.201
is Version 3x gonna be still supported?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They

64
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:17.938
just released 3x formally last week,
so [CROSSTALK].

65
00:04:17.938 --> 00:04:20.490
No, I mean, I can assert that as yes.

66
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.669
Ryan who is a former Frontend Master,
a current Frontend Master I guess.

67
00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.537
[LAUGH] He is a Frontend Master
in all senses of the word,

68
00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:32.235
has assured me that they will support one,
two, and

69
00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:36.690
three until people stop using them, so.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They want me to press you

70
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.538
a little bit more on what the difference
is between versions two, three, and

71
00:04:41.538 --> 00:04:43.120
four are?

72
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.689
And why you would choose one of the other?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The API

73
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:54.231
is totally different in
the way you should do it.

74
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:59.155
And I would assert strongly that four
is the simplest at the top of my head I

75
00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:03.197
really couldn't articulate
very well the differences but

76
00:05:03.197 --> 00:05:08.120
what I can say is that I have this version
of the workshop which is in v4 and

77
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.033
then I have the other version
of workshop which is in v1.

78
00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:16.004
And so, that would be pretty telling
to see two different apps were, is in

79
00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:21.100
the different versions of software so how
to go check out the v1 versions workshop.

80
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.442
If you're interested in comparing.

81
00:05:24.442 --> 00:05:27.670
And there was a pretty big
difference in two and three.

82
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.570
And we didn't do another workshop for
two or three.

83
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.630
Nor have I written much with it, so

84
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.900
I don't really know too
much of the difference.

85
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.967
Any questions?

86
00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:41.707
Excuse me.

87
00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:46.453
[COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

88
00:05:46.453 --> 00:05:50.767
landing is okay, so you can say that now.

89
00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.147
And here in cline app,

90
00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:00.870
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Do a couple more things

91
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.755
here.

92
00:06:01.755 --> 00:06:07.516
Let's put it up here.

93
00:06:07.516 --> 00:06:15.616
Import, hash router and match

94
00:06:19.258 --> 00:06:26.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From react-router.

95
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.720
So if you're following my notes here,
my notes here are a little messed up.

96
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.238
So fair warning.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

97
00:06:35.238 --> 00:06:36.870
we're gonna return here.

98
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.198
So first thing the route of this
particular component is gonna be

99
00:06:41.198 --> 00:06:48.554
the HashRouter.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

100
00:06:48.554 --> 00:06:50.604
then, we're gonna have
the div inside of that.

101
00:06:50.604 --> 00:06:57.866
And then, inside of the div you're
gonna have Match exactly pattern,

102
00:07:00.924 --> 00:07:03.684
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: ='/',

103
00:07:06.528 --> 00:07:11.255
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: component={Landing}, and

104
00:07:11.255 --> 00:07:14.584
looks just like that.

105
00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so save that.

106
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.910
Make sure your lint isn't yelling
at you or make sure it's running.

107
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.810
npn run dev.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I do have one.

108
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.750
Landing is not defined.

109
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.020
That's a good reason.

110
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.240
Import Landing from ./Landing,

111
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: New line required

112
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.499
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So in Landing,

113
00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:02.860
go give it a new line.

114
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.660
I probably should just turn that on in my,
in fact, I might.

115
00:08:13.381 --> 00:08:16.222
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [INAUDIBLE], let's see.

116
00:08:16.222 --> 00:08:19.127
New line, ensure new line at the save,

117
00:08:19.127 --> 00:08:26.707
that's what I want.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

118
00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:29.242
now, my editor will take care of it.

119
00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:32.442
So now, I don't have to keep doing that.

120
00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:37.098
So let's kinda pick apart
what has gone on here,

121
00:08:37.098 --> 00:08:40.290
let's make sure it still works.

122
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.750
You should see relatively the same thing.

123
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.410
That's the idea.

124
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.380
Except the only thing that you might
notice up here is you got the hash slash,

125
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.730
and I'll explain that momentarily where
that weird looking artifact came from.
