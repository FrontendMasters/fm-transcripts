00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.736
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna create a new file and

2
00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.802
we're going to put it in,
not in our JS directory but

3
00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:09.614
in the complete intro-to-react directory.

4
00:00:09.614 --> 00:00:13.500
And it's going to be called server.js.

5
00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:27.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.
We'll come back to that in just a second,

6
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.355
but that's what we'll need.

7
00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:32.180
But in the interim,
we're going to create another file.

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.655
This is going to be called app.js.

9
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.976
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna put
that inside of the .js directory.

10
00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:49.525
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, the reason we
created app is we're gonna move most of

11
00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:53.681
the code out of client app and
put that into app.js.

12
00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:57.280
App.js is going to be run both
on the server and on the client.

13
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.920
The client app is only going
to be around in the browser.

14
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.450
Why is that?

15
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.000
Well, this render right here,
this is actually what puts it on the DOM.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.620
If you try and
call the render inside of node,

17
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.340
it's gonna blow up because
the DOM is not there.

18
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.947
So we need to separate browser
concerns from universal concerns.

19
00:01:16.947 --> 00:01:25.105
When I say universal, I mean happens both
on the client and on the server, okay?

20
00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:30.330
So, what we're going to do here,
is we're basically

21
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.998
going to copy and
paste almost all of this to app.

22
00:01:34.998 --> 00:01:39.957
The only difference is, I think,
what's down here instead of render

23
00:01:39.957 --> 00:01:43.667
down here we're going to say,
export default App.

24
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:50.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And also, we don't need
anything from React DOM in here as well.

25
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.990
So, you can delete those imports as well.

26
00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:02.749
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, React DOM,
delete this import right here.

27
00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:11.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Also, for fun,
notice this has no state.

28
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.060
This is a really good place where
we could just make this a stateless

29
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.870
functional component.

30
00:02:24.502 --> 00:02:27.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's no
necessary burning reason to.

31
00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:29.850
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see.

32
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.168
You just fix it.

33
00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:32.336
Reinvent.

34
00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:35.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No.
Don't do that.

35
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.153
You don't know how to do that.

36
00:02:36.153 --> 00:02:40.927
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

37
00:02:46.394 --> 00:02:47.633
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right?

38
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.880
I think, it's a good idea.

39
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.880
You don't have to if you don't want to,
but less things going on.

40
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.630
So, I think it's a good idea.

41
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.130
So, we'll do it.

42
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.430
Okay.

43
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.870
So, now go back to client app.js.

44
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.820
Delete everything in there.

45
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.864
And we're just going to
import React from 'react'.

46
00:03:18.078 --> 00:03:25.012
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Import {
render } from 'react-dom'.

47
00:03:25.012 --> 00:03:32.115
Import
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

48
00:03:32.115 --> 00:03:35.922
I forgot to do that, too, so
we'll do that momentarily, as well.

49
00:03:35.922 --> 00:03:40.457
import { BrowserRouter }

50
00:03:40.457 --> 00:03:45.189
from 'react-router' and

51
00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:51.506
import App from './App', okay?

52
00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:55.818
And then, here, we're going to

53
00:03:55.818 --> 00:04:03.673
render
BrowserRouter&gt;&lt;App./&gt;&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;,

54
00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:07.371
document.getElementByID

55
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.190
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: App, okay.

56
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.535
So, we have to go back to app and
take out the browser router as well,

57
00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:19.610
because that's also a browser concern.

58
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.300
That's gonna interact with
like window.location and

59
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.340
you don't want that to try and
happen in the node environment.

60
00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:36.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, save that, go back
to app and take out browser router.

61
00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:51.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, so.

62
00:04:57.278 --> 00:04:58.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
one last thing we're gonna do,

63
00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:05.652
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is go to your index

64
00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:13.328
.HTML
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

65
00:05:13.328 --> 00:05:15.569
here we have React has not yet rendered.

66
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.190
There's a million and
a half ways you can do this,

67
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.320
I'm just choosing one way to do this,
but it actually makes no difference.

68
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:32.751
We need some way to template our
React string onto this HTML.

69
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:35.409
I'm gonna do it with low dash is template,
but

70
00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.530
you can do it any way that you want to.

71
00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:43.464
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, this is the way
that you do low dash templating,

72
00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:46.900
it's not particularly interesting,
it's just effective.

73
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.575
So, if you wanna do handle bars,
if you wanna just make your own string,

74
00:05:50.575 --> 00:05:54.457
if you just literally want to do string
concatenation, these are all fine.

75
00:05:54.457 --> 00:05:56.260
This is just one that
works really well for me.

76
00:05:59.316 --> 00:06:00.293
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

77
00:06:03.548 --> 00:06:06.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: About the EJS loader.

78
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What's that?

79
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: EJS loader?

80
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, there's a.

81
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: J2.

82
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The one that webpack
will take care of all of it, right?

83
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.010
Yeah, no, that's probably even better.

84
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.500
But a little bit more configuration.
