00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, something, kind of,

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.830
interesting probably happened,
if you're watching, here, in your bundles.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.370
Notice that you have two
bundles being generated now.

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.380
It's probably hard to see.

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.170
Let me make it bigger.

6
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.110
But, I have bundle, and 1pointbundle.js.

7
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.560
So webpack says,
okay you're doing system import here.

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.050
Cool, I know what to do with this and
it's like,

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.980
I'm going to cut that off the bundle.

10
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.088
Now, let's discuss why this
is actually not that great.

11
00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:33.910
Bundle.js is 1.04 MB,
cuz it has to include react,

12
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.179
axios, all of our preloaded data,
a bunch of that other stuff.

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.270
Landing is just really
that one react component.

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.870
So we're shaving 3.19 KB off of our
1 MB bundle, pretty dumb, right?

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.260
Not super compelling, but
now you know how to do it.

16
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.709
So if you can shave off big parts
of your app, this is how you do it.

17
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.814
So, if we're go into our app now,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I need to run

18
00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:05.770
my server again.

19
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.540
So, let's go to package.

20
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.210
Real quick, package.Json.

21
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.470
And we're gonna do server,

22
00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.723
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As : NODE_ENV=server node

23
00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:32.310
server.js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and now I can do,

24
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.014
or I can just start, actually start's
probably the one that you want, so

25
00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:43.661
start npm run start
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

26
00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:51.573
now if I go to localhost 5050,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

27
00:01:51.573 --> 00:02:00.320
variant, that's cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: React,createElement

28
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.730
type should not be null and
find a glare number.

29
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.079
Check the render method of component.

30
00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:22.825
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's get off this for

31
00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:23.537
just a second.

32
00:02:23.537 --> 00:02:27.489
Let's go just do it on npm run

33
00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.717
dev
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is everyone

34
00:02:32.717 --> 00:02:40.082
else seeing this too?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did I

35
00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:45.353
spell AsyncRoute wrong?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Richard,

36
00:02:45.353 --> 00:02:48.619
is wondering if you can't name
the React component with a lower case?

37
00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:51.725
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Export default,

38
00:02:51.725 --> 00:02:53.560
I'll answer in just a sec.

39
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.630
So I've got the export
down here at the bottom.

40
00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:44.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hm.

41
00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:03.481
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this., so I'm trying to

42
00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:08.899
figure out why this is
having a hard time loading,

43
00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:14.495
this.component.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

44
00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:16.764
false undefined, that's exactly what.

45
00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:18.596
[SOUND], that's what it is.

46
00:04:18.596 --> 00:04:24.610
So, remember that you have to interoperate

47
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.297
between common js and yes, six modules,

48
00:04:30.297 --> 00:04:36.510
it's not module, it's module.default.

49
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.110
Okay, and now this should work, cool.

50
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.750
So, get rid of that console.log.

51
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.210
So to demonstrate why I think this
is cool, so here I'm on search.

52
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.410
I refreshed the page, and
I can see all, let's do all right here.

53
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.694
Okay, as soon as I click svideo and
go back to the home page,

54
00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:08.842
I guess that's actually
what you want to see.

55
00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:11.610
So let's go back to browse all,
refresh the page.

56
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.350
And now if click go back to the homepage
at that point, only at that point,

57
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.060
does it actually request zero.bundle.js.

58
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.530
So Webpack was smart enough to do
all of that code splitting for us.

59
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.120
Is smart enough to go out and
request it for

60
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.580
us, pull it back in, package it up nicely,
inject it into that function and

61
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.285
then we're able to use it at that point.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

62
00:05:35.285 --> 00:05:42.960
it does quite a bit of stuff for you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

63
00:05:47.757 --> 00:05:49.239
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Craig noticed that when

64
00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:53.960
you refresh the page it flashed the body.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

65
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.520
cuz I turned off my node server.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

66
00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's turn it back

67
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:06.807
on.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is

68
00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:08.718
anyone ever use nodemon before?

69
00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:12.040
It's basically runs, it

70
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.830
watches all of your files then it restarts
your Node server as soon as you save.

71
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.890
It's like, watch for Node.

72
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.210
So I'm just gonna use that for now so
I can stop refreshing all the time.

73
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.444
I'll also push a branch here momentarily.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: nodemon

74
00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:35.280
app per server.js.

75
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.510
I suggest like, nodemons, you just
use it like you would normally use

76
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.430
node.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,

77
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.620
you can see it's watching this.

78
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.210
As soon as I save over here,
it restarts my server, right, so

79
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.930
I don't have to keep killing it and
restarting it.
