00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, something, kind of,

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.830
interesting probably happened,
if you're watching, here, in your bundles.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.370
Notice that you have two
bundles being generated now.

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.380
It's probably hard to see.

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.170
Let me make it bigger.

6
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.110
But, I have bundle, and 1pointbundle.js.

7
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.560
So webpack says,
okay you're doing system import here.

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.050
Cool, I know what to do with this and
it's like,

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.980
I'm going to cut that off the bundle.

10
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.088
Now, let's discuss why this
is actually not that great.

11
00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:33.910
Bundle.js is 1.04 MB,
cuz it has to include react,

12
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.179
axios, all of our preloaded data,
a bunch of that other stuff.

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.270
Landing is just really
that one react component.

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.870
So we're shaving 3.19 KB off of our
1 MB bundle, pretty dumb, right?

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.260
Not super compelling, but
now you know how to do it.

16
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.709
So if you can shave off big parts
of your app, this is how you do it.

17
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.814
So, if we're go into our app now,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I need to run

18
00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:05.770
my server again.

19
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.540
So, let's go to package.

20
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.210
Real quick, package.Json.

21
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.470
And we're gonna do server,

22
00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.867
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As : NODE_ENV=server

23
00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:26.296
node server.js.

24
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.874
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
now I can do, or I can just start,

25
00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:38.014
actually start's probably
the one that you want, so

26
00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:43.661
start npm run start
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

27
00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:52.960
now if I go to localhost 5050,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And variant, that's cool.

28
00:01:59.116 --> 00:02:01.641
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: React,createElement
type should not be null and

29
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:02.730
find a glare number.

30
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.079
Check the render method of component.

31
00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:23.537
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's get off this for just a second.

32
00:02:23.537 --> 00:02:27.489
Let's go just do it on npm run

33
00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.763
dev
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is

34
00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:34.985
everyone else seeing this too?

35
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did I
spell AsyncRoute wrong?

36
00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:47.951
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Richard, is wondering if
you can't name the React component with

37
00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:48.619
a lower case?

38
00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:53.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Export default,
I'll answer in just a sec.

39
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.630
So I've got the export
down here at the bottom.

40
00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:44.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hm.

41
00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:05.545
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this., so
I'm trying to figure out why this

42
00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:11.103
is having a hard time loading,
this.component.

43
00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.764
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So false undefined,
that's exactly what.

44
00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:18.596
[SOUND], that's what it is.

45
00:04:18.596 --> 00:04:24.610
So, remember that you have to interoperate

46
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.297
between common js and yes, six modules,

47
00:04:30.297 --> 00:04:36.510
it's not module, it's module.default.

48
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.110
Okay, and now this should work, cool.

49
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.750
So, get rid of that console.log.

50
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.210
So to demonstrate why I think this
is cool, so here I'm on search.

51
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.410
I refreshed the page, and
I can see all, let's do all right here.

52
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.694
Okay, as soon as I click svideo and
go back to the home page,

53
00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:08.842
I guess that's actually
what you want to see.

54
00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:11.610
So let's go back to browse all,
refresh the page.

55
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.350
And now if click go back to the homepage
at that point, only at that point,

56
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.060
does it actually request zero.bundle.js.

57
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.530
So Webpack was smart enough to do
all of that code splitting for us.

58
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.190
Is smart enough to go out and request it
for us, pull it back in, package it up

59
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.950
nicely, inject it into that function and
then we're able to use it at that point.

60
00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:36.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
it does quite a bit of stuff for you.

61
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

62
00:05:47.757 --> 00:05:51.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Craig noticed that when you
refresh the page it flashed the body.

63
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
cuz I turned off my node server.

64
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

65
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's turn it back on.

66
00:06:06.692 --> 00:06:08.718
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is anyone
ever use nodemon before?

67
00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:12.040
It's basically runs, it

68
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.830
watches all of your files then it restarts
your Node server as soon as you save.

69
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.890
It's like, watch for Node.

70
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.210
So I'm just gonna use that for now so
I can stop refreshing all the time.

71
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.740
I'll also push a branch here momentarily.

72
00:06:24.401 --> 00:06:30.052
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: nodemon app per

73
00:06:30.052 --> 00:06:35.280
server.js.

74
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.690
I suggest like, nodemons, you just use
it like you would normally use node.

75
00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:42.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
you can see it's watching this.

76
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.210
As soon as I save over here,
it restarts my server, right, so

77
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.930
I don't have to keep killing it and
restarting it.
