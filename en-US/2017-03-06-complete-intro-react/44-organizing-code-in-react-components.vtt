&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The way that I personally
organize my React components,

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.540
this is kind of like Brian Holt,
the way I do things.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.090
It's not necessarily gospel, but I found
it to be a common pattern to arrive at.

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.120
As I always have propTypes first,

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.340
100% of the time,
first thing in the component is propTypes.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.270
This just lets people coming in know,

7
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.690
here are the props you're
gonna be dealing with.

8
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.965
Second thing is getInitialState.

9
00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:28.610
Here's the state that you're
gonna be dealing with.

10
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.110
Then we haven't done any
life-cycle methods yet.

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.349
We're about to within the next,
I don't know, half-hour or so.

12
00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:39.940
But life-cycle methods would be next.

13
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.910
After that is all the functions
that I wrote, right?

14
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.690
So like the handleSearchTerm, that's just
a method that I wrote for my convenience.

15
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.477
And then the very last thing
that I put on there is render.

16
00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:57.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's the way
I organize my React components.

17
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.293
There's no reason you have
to do it that way, but

18
00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:03.192
I just find that to be a very
readable way to organize my code.

19
00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:06.892
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They're asking

20
00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:09.804
to see cleanapp.js, clientapp.js again.

21
00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:20.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any other
questions before I move on?

22
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.375
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Another question,
which method do you prefer for

23
00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:29.241
handling secured routes,
React router or higher order component?

24
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:32.034
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So secure route being
the sense that you probably need to be

25
00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:32.890
authenticated.

26
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.750
There's a bunch of ways
you can handle that,

27
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.810
and I think higher order components is
definitely an easier way to handle that.

28
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.210
That's the way I'd typically choose to.

29
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.407
A higher order component, just to recap,
I think I briefly mentioned it yesterday,

30
00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:51.177
but I'll say again,
is BrowerRouter itself has no display.

31
00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.970
It doesn't exactly show you anything.

32
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.770
What it is, it's a component that
encapsulates behavior, right?

33
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.972
It's a router, right?

34
00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:03.712
And so it's considered a higher order
component in a sense that it's supposed to

35
00:02:03.712 --> 00:02:07.910
wrap other components in it, and views
behavior on whatever it encapsulates.

36
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.510
So we encapsulate our app with
BrowserRouter and it basically says, okay,

37
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.260
now you have routing behavior.

38
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.410
Now go make your markup and

39
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.240
do whatever behavior you were meant to use
from the higher order component, right?

40
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.320
So you can do the same sort of
thing with like Match, right.

41
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.220
You could wrap this in a component
that only matches when someone is

42
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.960
securely authenticated to whatever
route they're supposed to be going to.

43
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.860
And I won't show that today
because no one likes doing Auth.

44
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.060
I don't like doing Auth.

45
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.020
But there's another front end masters
course on that, so you should watch that
