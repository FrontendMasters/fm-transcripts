00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.180
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's go plug in our
interface to deal with Redux now, okay?

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.764
So, go to clientapp.js.

3
00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:16.940
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay,
we need to plug Redux into our app.

4
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.930
And they've actually done something for
you, so that it's really easy to do.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.102
So, up here at the top I'm
going to import provider

6
00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:35.350
from 'react-redux'.

7
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.630
React redux is a pretty small
library specifically for

8
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.340
connecting the two together.

9
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.910
It's a convenience method,
you could totally do it yourself.

10
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.469
This is just a lot easier.

11
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:52.752
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay?

12
00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:54.209
Inside of &lt;browserrouter&gt;.

13
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.300
&gt;&gt; Brian: You're gonna do provider.

14
00:01:05.192 --> 00:01:07.202
&gt;&gt; Brian: And weâ€™ll select that.

15
00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.720
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, yeah,
BrowserRouter, then provider.

16
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.815
And then everything else.

17
00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:25.289
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then the other
thing we need to to is import up

18
00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.597
here is import store from './store'.

19
00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:34.328
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, up there.

20
00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:43.062
&gt;&gt; Brian: And we're gonna say,
store = {store}

21
00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:50.845
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, now,

22
00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:54.650
this little tiny library it kind of does
[LAUGH] a little bit of black magic.

23
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.430
I wouldn't worry too much exactly
about how it internally works.

24
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.462
But what it's gonna do is it's going to
make redux available inside of your app,

25
00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:06.335
so, now, you can connect to your app to
redux where it needs to be connected.

26
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:21.212
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now, that it's available
let's go back to landing.js.

27
00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:27.525
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, up here at the top.

28
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.730
We're going to import
{connect} from 'react-redux'.

29
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.100
Again we're in landing.js.

30
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.060
Connect is a method that
we'll use here momentarily.

31
00:02:53.203 --> 00:02:54.238
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

32
00:02:57.094 --> 00:03:00.060
&gt;&gt; Brian: Then what we're gonna
do down here underneath landing.

33
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.683
We're going to create a new function
called const mapStateToProps.

34
00:03:09.317 --> 00:03:12.064
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's going to be
a function that takes in state.

35
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.763
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
what it's going to do is it's going

36
00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:27.359
to return an object
searchTerm: state.searchTerm.

37
00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.787
So, basically it's gonna take
in your entire redux store, and

38
00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:36.543
you're going to return a object of
just the particular piece of state

39
00:03:36.543 --> 00:03:40.070
that this component cares about, right?

40
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.700
So, landing cares about search term,
it cares about nothing else from redox, so

41
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.080
it's only going to take in search term.

42
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.570
So, what this is going to do is it's going
to take this redox state, and its going to

43
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.999
pass this in as props to landing, right?,
does that make sense, because we want

44
00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:59.324
search term to come in from redox, so its
going to pass it in as a prop to landing.

45
00:04:02.507 --> 00:04:08.054
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
the way that it's actually gonna end

46
00:04:08.054 --> 00:04:14.743
up happening is we're
gonna do export default,

47
00:04:14.743 --> 00:04:19.475
and we're gonna call connect with

48
00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:24.547
(napStateToProp)(Landing).

49
00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:32.680
So, now,
landing is a redux connected component.

50
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.190
So, what connect does,
is you call it with mapStateToProps.

51
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.850
It creates a new function.

52
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.690
Which we are then immediately
invoking on landing.

53
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.990
That's why it has that two-function call.

54
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.740
So, connect returns a function, and
then we're calling that function.

55
00:04:54.647 --> 00:04:59.970
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, now, landing is always going
to have that redux available search term.

56
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.230
That make sense any questions about that?

57
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.379
Okay, so, now,
we have search term available as a prop.

58
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.000
To landing.

59
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.289
So, let's actually go document that,
const {string} = React.

60
00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.416
PropType.

61
00:05:30.416 --> 00:05:32.274
Then here we're gonna say,

62
00:05:32.274 --> 00:05:41.310
propType: and
searchTerm is going to be a string.

63
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.460
Okay.

64
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.930
And now, we can put that on input.

65
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.987
So, now, value is going to be equal

66
00:05:51.987 --> 00:05:56.880
to {this.props.search term}.

67
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.769
Right.

68
00:06:11.748 --> 00:06:14.445
&gt;&gt; Brian: So,
just to demonstrate this working.

69
00:06:14.445 --> 00:06:16.565
I'll actually push a branch.

70
00:06:16.565 --> 00:06:18.395
Yeah, I'll push a branch after this.

71
00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:28.180
We'll write the, yeah, so we'll in about,
we'll take a break in about 20 minutes.

72
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.838
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Looks like you may
have a typo, scroll up a little bit.

73
00:06:30.838 --> 00:06:32.933
PropTypes.

74
00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:34.652
React.PropTypes, line four.

75
00:06:34.652 --> 00:06:38.053
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yes.

76
00:06:38.053 --> 00:06:40.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What did
you say about 20 minutes.

77
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.860
&gt;&gt; Brian: We'll break for
lunch in twenty minutes, is that too long?

78
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a question-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Kind of, it's 12:20 already.

79
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.110
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, I'll finish this and
we'll take a break.

80
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's got a question,

81
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.560
where have you define the props
in landing component?

82
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.130
The part of the interface, right?

83
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.400
&gt;&gt; Brian: Where did I define it?

84
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.580
Or why did I define it?

85
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Where?

86
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.320
&gt;&gt; Brian: So,
it's coming from redux, right?

87
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.607
That's what this mapStateToProps does,
is it pulls out of redux, and

88
00:07:05.607 --> 00:07:06.971
passes it in as a prop.

89
00:07:09.937 --> 00:07:12.891
&gt;&gt; Brian: And that's where it comes
in here, as it's coming from redux.

90
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.741
Via connect.

91
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.028
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, connect is just
going to inject that in there.

92
00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:22.373
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so

93
00:07:22.373 --> 00:07:27.210
just to kind of demonstrate to
you this is actually working.

94
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.010
Well, let's go back to reducers.

95
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.641
And just put in something random in here.

96
00:07:36.544 --> 00:07:37.970
&gt;&gt; Brian: It can literally
be something random.

97
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.930
So, now, if we save that, still running,
okay, and we refresh, and

98
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.880
go back to the home page, now,

99
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.735
we're getting something random in their,
which is coming from redux, right?

100
00:07:52.775 --> 00:07:55.485
You won't be able to modify it for
the same reason that before.

101
00:07:55.485 --> 00:07:58.267
We have no way of modifying redux.

102
00:07:58.267 --> 00:08:01.208
But I guess, you're just gonna
have to hang on the edge of your

103
00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:03.000
seats until after lunch to fix that.

104
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.874
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
