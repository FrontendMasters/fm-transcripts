WEBVTT

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, we have landing,
reading, writing to Redux.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.260
But now search term is not reading from,
or sorry,

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.740
search is not reading from Redux.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.080
So now we needed to go make
search read from Redux.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.372
So we're going to go to search.js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

6
00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:24.669
we're going to import
{connect} at the top.

7
00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.215
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 'react-redux'

8
00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:38.983
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, we're gonna add

9
00:00:38.983 --> 00:00:48.714
searchTerm to our propTypes
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm going to change Header,

10
00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:53.388
cuz Header's no longer not going to be,
sorry, search is no longer

11
00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:58.990
going to keep track of searchTerm,
cuz that all lives off in Redux land.

12
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.424
So Header no longer needs
to receive these from.

13
00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:06.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From Redux.

14
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.603
So now Header should just look like this.

15
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.674
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We also don't

16
00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:27.355
need getInitialState, that's totally gone.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We

17
00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:31.260
don't need handleSearchTermChange,
so that's totally gone.

18
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.296
Cuz all of that lives in Redux now, it's
totally been abstracted away from React.

19
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.953
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you go into our filter

20
00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:46.290
here, it's gonna be,
let's see, instead of state.

21
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.680
So here it says this.state.searchTerm,
right?

22
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.470
It's not being read from state anymore,
it's being read from props.

23
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.215
So you're gonna say props.searchterm,

24
00:01:55.215 --> 00:02:02.181
toUpperCase.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and what we're

25
00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:07.860
gonna do down here to the bottom is we're
going to write our map state to props.

26
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.864
Const mapStateToProps = (state).

27
00:02:21.226 --> 00:02:24.817
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: return searchTerm:

28
00:02:24.817 --> 00:02:28.610
state.searchTerm.

29
00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:35.393
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

30
00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:41.107
And then now we just need to connect.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

31
00:02:41.107 --> 00:02:45.318
(mapStateToProps)(Search).

32
00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:49.540
Is there a question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Couple questions.

33
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.948
Owen wants to know is
context the same as window?

34
00:02:52.948 --> 00:02:54.486
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, it's a-

35
00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:57.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's like an internal-

36
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's an internal

37
00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.410
reaction.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Structure

38
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.660
too.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

39
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.200
It's specific to React.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

40
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.016
And AB's asking,
is with router available in React

41
00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:10.882
router four?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is with

42
00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:12.470
router?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That was

43
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.790
in-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know.

44
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They're saying this

45
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.330
was in React router three.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna go with

46
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.660
there's very little in
common between v3 and v4.

47
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.300
It's a total rewrite.

48
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.610
So I'm gonna go ahead and assume not.

49
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.893
But I don't know,
cuz I don't know what with router is.

50
00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:38.408
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now if we save,

51
00:03:38.408 --> 00:03:41.310
then come back to.

52
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.490
I should see if we're doing okay.

53
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.150
We're doing okay.

54
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.000
So, now if I refresh here.

55
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.640
I'll actually go back to the homepage now.

56
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.780
And I type in here like house and
I hit Enter.

57
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.570
Now, it's, notice, it's being searched for
house, like the search is correct, right?

58
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.736
But notice our header is still wrong
because we still have not modified our

59
00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:07.077
header to read from Redux as well, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

60
00:04:07.077 --> 00:04:09.460
that is the correct search.
