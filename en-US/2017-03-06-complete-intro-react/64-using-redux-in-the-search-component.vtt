00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, we have landing,
reading, writing to Redux.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.260
But now search term is not reading from,
or sorry,

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.740
search is not reading from Redux.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.080
So now we needed to go make
search read from Redux.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.803
So we're going to go to search.js.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.669
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're going
to import {connect} at the top.

7
00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:37.998
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 'react-redux'
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

8
00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:40.678
we're gonna add searchTerm
to our propTypes

9
00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:48.714
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm going to change Header,

10
00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:53.388
cuz Header's no longer not going to be,
sorry, search is no longer

11
00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:58.990
going to keep track of searchTerm,
cuz that all lives off in Redux land.

12
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.424
So Header no longer needs
to receive these from.

13
00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:06.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From Redux.

14
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.603
So now Header should just look like this.

15
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.693
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

16
00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:25.443
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We also don't need
getInitialState, that's totally gone.

17
00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:29.574
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We don't need
handleSearchTermChange, so

18
00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:31.260
that's totally gone.

19
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.296
Cuz all of that lives in Redux now, it's
totally been abstracted away from React.

20
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.645
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you go into
our filter here, it's gonna be,

21
00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:46.290
let's see, instead of state.

22
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.680
So here it says this.state.searchTerm,
right?

23
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.470
It's not being read from state anymore,
it's being read from props.

24
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.211
So you're gonna say props.searchterm,
toUpperCase.

25
00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:05.525
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and what we're gonna
do down here to the bottom is we're going

26
00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.860
to write our map state to props.

27
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.864
Const mapStateToProps = (state).

28
00:02:21.226 --> 00:02:28.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: return
searchTerm: state.searchTerm.

29
00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:35.393
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

30
00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:37.258
And then now we just need to connect.

31
00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:45.318
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
(mapStateToProps)(Search).

32
00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:48.160
Is there a question?

33
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Couple questions.

34
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.948
Owen wants to know is
context the same as window?

35
00:02:52.948 --> 00:02:57.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, it's a-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's like an internal-

36
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's an internal reaction.

37
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Structure too.

38
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
It's specific to React.

39
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

40
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.333
And AB's asking, is with router
available in React router four?

41
00:03:10.426 --> 00:03:12.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is with router?

42
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That was in-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know.

43
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They're saying
this was in React router three.

44
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna go with there's
very little in common between v3 and v4.

45
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.300
It's a total rewrite.

46
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.610
So I'm gonna go ahead and assume not.

47
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.893
But I don't know,
cuz I don't know what with router is.

48
00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:41.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now if we save, then come back to.

49
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.490
I should see if we're doing okay.

50
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.150
We're doing okay.

51
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.000
So, now if I refresh here.

52
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.640
I'll actually go back to the homepage now.

53
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.780
And I type in here like house and
I hit Enter.

54
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.570
Now, it's, notice, it's being searched for
house, like the search is correct, right?

55
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.736
But notice our header is still wrong
because we still have not modified our

56
00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:04.587
header to read from Redux as well, right?

57
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
that is the correct search.
