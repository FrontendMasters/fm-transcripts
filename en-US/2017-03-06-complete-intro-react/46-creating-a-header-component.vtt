00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.305
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so we have
kind of a code smell going on here.

2
00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:07.887
We have this header up here,
well the one code smell is spinning art,

3
00:00:07.887 --> 00:00:09.710
right, that's a bad one.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.430
The second one is we have
this header here, and

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.550
we also have the same header in search,
right?

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.900
So we have duplicated code.

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.720
So that's a code smell too, that's
probably a component onto itself, so

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.810
I should abstract that into a component,
and then use it in both places, right?

9
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.330
Cuz, let's say you change
your branding tomorrow, and

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.440
then now you're a different shade
of purple or whatever, right?

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.710
It sucks to have to go and
update that in every single place.

12
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.730
As much as you can update just one place,
that's better.

13
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.340
So let's go ahead and
go abstract that into its own component.

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.665
So make a new file.

15
00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:49.226
Call it Header.js.

16
00:00:52.908 --> 00:00:56.321
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And inside of Header,

17
00:00:56.321 --> 00:01:00.990
import React from 'react',

18
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.926
import { Link } from react-router.

19
00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:12.339
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
I think this is a good place to do it.

20
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, so far I've showed
you stateless functional components.

21
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.240
I've showed you the react create
class method of creating components.

22
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm gonna show you the last way
to do components right now,

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.070
which is the ES6 class syntax.

24
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.833
So we're gonna say class Header
extends React.Component.

25
00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:41.788
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then down here at the bottom,

26
00:01:41.788 --> 00:01:45.322
we're gonna say export Default Header.

27
00:01:45.322 --> 00:01:46.540
Okay.

28
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.401
So ES6 classes,
I'm not personally a big fan,

29
00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:54.550
it's feels too Java-y to me.

30
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.640
[LAUGH] But, this is the way that react
is choosing to go, for good reasons.

31
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.230
They're trying to get away from
having their own class syntax, and

32
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.290
their trying to draw within
the JavaScript lines, and

33
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.750
just draw within the language itself,
understandable.

34
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.200
But you lose some conveniences,
which we will probably see momentarily.

35
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.225
But for now, this works more or
less the same,

36
00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:22.262
we're gonna have a render method right
here, which is going to return mark up.

37
00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:26.806
Only reason I'd show you this, is if you
go to read the react docs right now,

38
00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:28.803
this is what they look like, so.

39
00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:39.090
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So my caveat here,
is things are mostly the same and

40
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.805
not totally the same.

41
00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:42.371
So just keep that in mind.

42
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.890
We are gonna run up here
momentarily into some differences.

43
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:51.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so inside of
the header we're gonna put in h1.

44
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.559
And inside of the h1
we're gonna put a Link,

45
00:02:56.414 --> 00:02:57.192
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To, right, and

46
00:02:57.192 --> 00:03:00.194
someone clicks on the branding
they probably expect to go back to

47
00:03:00.194 --> 00:03:02.708
the home page, so
that's just what we're gonna do.

48
00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:09.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
that's all we're gonna do for right now.

49
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.780
Any questions so far?

50
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.627
We'll eventually get to the differences
between ES6 classes and

51
00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:19.864
react create class, but
beyond that, any questions?

52
00:03:26.523 --> 00:03:30.371
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

53
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:34.643
now let's go pull that into details.js.

54
00:03:38.148 --> 00:03:42.538
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So up here at the top say,

55
00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:48.404
import Header from ./Header.

56
00:03:51.822 --> 00:03:57.207
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And instead of this header
right here, we're just gonna have Header.

57
00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:20.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
go back to your details page.

58
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.106
And now if you click on header,
or sorry on the svideo,

59
00:04:26.106 --> 00:04:28.787
it should take you back to the home page.
