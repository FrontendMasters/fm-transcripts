00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.232
Even if you're working in JavaScript, even
if you're working with all of the tools of

2
00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:10.620
modern web development, you should always
be starting with semantic meaningful HTML.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.160
It will overcome a lot of the problems
that you encounter later on.

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.423
We have all kinds of people these days
talking about how they're using ARIA to

5
00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:21.516
compensate for
things that are built into native HTML.

6
00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:24.040
So always start with good markup.

7
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.711
But what can we do before we
even start with good markup?

8
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:29.511
We have to start with good content, and so

9
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:32.554
this is what we're going
to start with here.

10
00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:37.118
We're going to start in this
very first code pen right here.

11
00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:40.594
So if you click on the link for
the beginning code pen,

12
00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:45.167
you'll see that we have some pretty
basic looking kind of stuff here.

13
00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:50.019
And what I've done over here on the side
is I've given you sort of a mad

14
00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.540
lib as we used to say in the old days.

15
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.779
So hi my name is, fill it in with your
name, and then some kind of verb.

16
00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:03.394
I do something, I teach, I develop, I
create, I design, whatever verb you want,

17
00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:06.709
those are suggestions,
fill in something else if you like.

18
00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:10.302
And then fill in the other thing
that you happen to do, just so

19
00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:13.407
you know what ultimately
this is going to look like.

20
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:17.049
We're building this little piece
of text right here on the screen.

21
00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.234
So you don't want this to go and
be a great big huge long thing.

22
00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:23.418
How can you condense
what you do into four,

23
00:01:23.418 --> 00:01:26.610
five words, maybe six words tops, okay?

24
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.612
What is the focus of what
it is that you're doing?

25
00:01:29.612 --> 00:01:31.766
And then you can give yourself a title.

26
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:34.396
You're an educator or
a student, a developer,

27
00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:38.127
a designer who specializes in whatever
it is that you specialize in.

28
00:01:38.127 --> 00:01:41.780
And then currently what are you doing?

29
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.255
And so that's the formula that I
want you to go ahead and fill in.

30
00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:47.083
Go, don't worry about the markup yet.

31
00:01:51.398 --> 00:01:53.088
Hopefully that went well for you.

32
00:01:53.088 --> 00:01:55.800
You were able to fill
in that information and

33
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.745
you have at least some
starting text to go from.

34
00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:01.276
By the way,
that code pen that I've given you,

35
00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:05.666
you'll see in the instructions I give you
a lot of beginning and ending code pens.

36
00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:09.436
From that very first codepen, if you're
following along the whole way through this

37
00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:13.117
text example, you don't need to keep
checking in with the additional codepens.

38
00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:16.747
Those are mostly there for people who
might wanna jump in along the way or

39
00:02:16.747 --> 00:02:18.454
skip over parts of this process.

40
00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:23.111
So you can just continue to work in
the same codepen as you move on to

41
00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:25.412
the next particular exercise.

42
00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:30.610
So hopefully you have about this much
text, in other words, not a whole lot.

43
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.966
Hopefully it reflects something that is
very personal and accurate about you.

44
00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:39.865
So once you have that
great content in place,

45
00:02:39.865 --> 00:02:43.694
the next thing to do is to start
thinking about your markup.

46
00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:45.838
How are we going to mark this up?

47
00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:50.706
And I've given you, this is the end
result that we're going for here,

48
00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:55.250
so we have tiny text on the top and
we have bigger text underneath and

49
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.707
then we have some more little text.

50
00:02:57.707 --> 00:03:04.849
But remember, HTML stands for what,
the hypertext markup language, right?

51
00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.667
Nowhere in that does that say design,

52
00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:13.140
nowhere in that does that say colors or
size or boldness or anything else.

53
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.329
HTML is all about communicating
the message behind this information.

54
00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.258
So I'm gonna give you again five
minutes to take your first pass at how

55
00:03:23.258 --> 00:03:24.220
to mark this up.

56
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.803
It's trickier than you think and
that's your hint.

57
00:03:27.803 --> 00:03:32.066
[LAUGH] And so
what I want you to think about here is,

58
00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:35.631
what is the most important thing, okay?

59
00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:36.749
I'll give another hint.

60
00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.236
The h1 is not gonna be
located in this text.

61
00:03:39.236 --> 00:03:43.201
We're going to put the h1
in the nav bar later on.

62
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:47.065
But for right now, so start with
something like h2 for a heading.

63
00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:50.075
What is the most important part
of this information that's here?

64
00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:52.141
So what gets the h2?

65
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:54.105
What is less important information?

66
00:03:54.105 --> 00:03:57.081
That might get something like
a paragraph tag for example.

67
00:03:57.081 --> 00:03:59.346
Is there any other information in here?

68
00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:03.094
Maybe you wanna make a link, for
example, where would that go?

69
00:04:03.094 --> 00:04:06.933
What resources are going to and
what does that markup look like?

70
00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:11.695
Take a look at this, think really hard
about what the HTML might be to mark this

71
00:04:11.695 --> 00:04:15.817
up, and I'm gonna go through
the answer with you in just a second.

72
00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:17.176
Go ahead and give it a try.

73
00:04:21.503 --> 00:04:22.540
How would you do with that?

74
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.600
Hopefully things went okay for you.

75
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.326
And so I'm gonna talk you
through the answer here.

76
00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:32.959
And before I go into that, the thing to
remember about semantic HTML is that,

77
00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:35.953
what is the meaning that
you are trying to convey,

78
00:04:35.953 --> 00:04:39.334
that is behind everything
that you do in semantic HTML.

79
00:04:39.334 --> 00:04:42.869
So in other words,
there is no one correct answer.

80
00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:47.510
If you are trying to convey certain
types of information, that should drive

81
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.730
the choice of HTML elements that
you use to convey that information.

82
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.005
And your choices may be different than
mine because you're trying to convey

83
00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:57.016
something else.

84
00:04:57.016 --> 00:05:01.006
So let's go through what I have here for
an answer for this.

85
00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:04.524
We won't worry about how this
looks because that doesn't matter,

86
00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:06.818
we can make it look
however we want with CSS.

87
00:05:06.818 --> 00:05:11.338
So here is my particular text here.

88
00:05:11.338 --> 00:05:15.481
So first of all I've surrounded this
whole thing with a section tag,

89
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:18.564
because this is going to
be a section of my webpage.

90
00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:22.029
This isn't really information that
could stand by itself who would make

91
00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:25.454
an interesting webpage, although
maybe you could argue that it does.

92
00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:29.390
If it did it could be an article,
but in this particular case,

93
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.662
I'm just considering this
part of a larger whole.

94
00:05:32.662 --> 00:05:37.862
So I've used my section element here and
I've given it an ID, an intro,

95
00:05:37.862 --> 00:05:43.765
because I may ultimately wind up making a
link to this particular part of the page.

96
00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:47.751
So that's why I've used
an ID as opposed to a class.

97
00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:52.110
If that doesn't make sense to you as
to how to make a link within the page,

98
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.978
we will of course talk about that
later when we get to the nav bar.

99
00:05:55.978 --> 00:05:58.355
The next thing is hi my
name is Jen Kramer and

100
00:05:58.355 --> 00:06:01.536
I suspect many of you probably
put a heading around this.

101
00:06:01.536 --> 00:06:05.900
But I gave you a hint that the h1
is going to be in the nav bar.

102
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.720
So as you look at the final version of the
webpage, you know that I have my name up

103
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.167
here in the upper left hand corner,
kind of like a logo.

104
00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:17.464
That is actually going
to take the h1 later.

105
00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:21.622
And while you can have multiple h1's
on a web page, generally speaking,

106
00:06:21.622 --> 00:06:24.867
the trend in front end web
development is to have only one.

107
00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:28.770
So if you're taking that approach
of only one h1 on the page,

108
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.234
then you need to figure out
where the h2 is going to do.

109
00:06:32.234 --> 00:06:35.500
If my name is the most important
thing in the h1 on top,

110
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.470
I've decided that I teach the web is the
most important part of this introduction,

111
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.601
because that tells you what you do.

112
00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:46.844
Nobody cares who Jen Kramer is unless you
are gonna pair that with something that

113
00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:50.455
gives you context because by the way
there's a Jen Kramer who ran for

114
00:06:50.455 --> 00:06:54.382
political office in Chicago and
there's a Jen Kramer who's a magician in

115
00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:57.459
Las Vegas and
there's many other Jen Kramers out there.

116
00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:02.418
So this is the one who teaches the web,
that's why I've made that the h2.

117
00:07:02.418 --> 00:07:05.447
As for hi my name is,
I mark that up as a paragraph and

118
00:07:05.447 --> 00:07:10.306
I did put a span tag around the words Jen
Kramer because clearly we're gonna have to

119
00:07:10.306 --> 00:07:14.906
sell that differently than everything
else that's there in that sentence.

120
00:07:14.906 --> 00:07:19.028
Then I have a paragraph with the
information about what it is that I do for

121
00:07:19.028 --> 00:07:23.567
work, and another paragraph talking
about what I'm doing currently which is

122
00:07:23.567 --> 00:07:28.037
creating courses for Frontend Masters,
and I link to my information there on

123
00:07:28.037 --> 00:07:31.505
the Frontend Masters website and
then I closed my section.

124
00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:33.749
Why span and not h2 and h3?

125
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:35.750
Great question.

126
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.163
Why span and not h2 and h3,
because this is a full sentence.

127
00:07:40.163 --> 00:07:42.460
Hi my name is Jen Kramer.

128
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.864
That is a whole sentence.

129
00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:47.902
If we used an h2 for
whatever, Jen Kramer and

130
00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:52.789
hi my name is is an h3,
then we are actually nesting two

131
00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:57.807
headings inside of each other,
which is kind of weird.

132
00:07:57.807 --> 00:08:02.704
The other part of that is it's one
complete sentence that is kind

133
00:08:02.704 --> 00:08:03.978
of a paragraph.

134
00:08:03.978 --> 00:08:06.776
We wouldn't want to break that
up into multiple headings.

135
00:08:06.776 --> 00:08:10.938
So you're probably thinking about the HTML
is more of a sailing mechanism here,

136
00:08:10.938 --> 00:08:13.890
as opposed to the meaning
that you're trying to convey.
