00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.562
All right, so that winds up being the end
of the course here at this point in time.

2
00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:07.700
We have built a two page website
that we set out to create.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.170
We made our homepage,
we made a very complex layout.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.750
We have our About page which is
actually a subset of that layout.

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.903
We've gone through and
tested everything, and

6
00:00:16.903 --> 00:00:19.690
made sure that our links
are going together correctly.

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.017
That we are being skipped down
the page appropriately, or

8
00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:28.180
shifted to another page
appropriately on the website.

9
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.368
And you will find here that in the
instructions for chapter seven, I've given

10
00:00:33.368 --> 00:00:38.492
you some additional options that you can
add to the site at this point in time.

11
00:00:38.492 --> 00:00:42.921
You can add hamburger buttons and
drop-down menus and additional projects

12
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:47.989
and all kinds of other things if you wanna
continue building this particular website.

13
00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.432
If you're looking for
some next steps for this course,

14
00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:55.826
the next thing I would recommend for
you to work on would be my flexbox and

15
00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:58.262
grid course here at Frontend Masters.

16
00:00:58.262 --> 00:01:02.484
That is going to teach you more about the
layouts in much more detail than I've gone

17
00:01:02.484 --> 00:01:03.290
through here.

18
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.712
So here you got a little tiny little
baby introduction to some of those

19
00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:07.539
technologies.

20
00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:10.764
That course will take you into flexbox and
grid very deeply.

21
00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:14.817
And will teach you lots and
lots of different tricks and tips for

22
00:01:14.817 --> 00:01:19.880
working with CSS layouts, and really
build your skills and your confidence.

23
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.550
So thank you all so much for watching.

24
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.340
I really appreciate it.

25
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.410
I hope you enjoyed today's work.

26
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.400
And I hope to see you in the future
at another Frontend Masters course.

27
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.262
Thanks so much.
