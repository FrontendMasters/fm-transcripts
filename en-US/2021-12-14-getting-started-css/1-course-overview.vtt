00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.951
So let's go through all of the things
that we're gonna be covering today and

2
00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:05.443
get a sense for what this is.

3
00:00:05.443 --> 00:00:09.568
First of all,
there is a course website and

4
00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:14.381
the course website is
getting started with all one

5
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:19.206
word getting started with
dot CSS dot education.

6
00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:20.557
And if you go there,

7
00:00:20.557 --> 00:00:25.019
you will find this website where
it says getting started with CSS.

8
00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.402
And you'll notice down here as we scroll
down a little bit, there's a listing of

9
00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:34.042
the seven chapters, the things that we're
going to look at today, a little bit about

10
00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:38.570
our course objectives, and a little bit
of background about the workshop itself.

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.363
Before I go into all of that, let me show
you the finished portfolio site that we're

12
00:00:43.363 --> 00:00:48.023
going to build today, it looks shockingly
like the website that I just showed you

13
00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:50.852
and you'll see here,
we have a navigation bar.

14
00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:53.258
You have your name on its portfolio site,

15
00:00:53.258 --> 00:00:56.504
we have a little bit of
introductory text up here on the.

16
00:00:56.504 --> 00:01:01.696
Then we have a series of projects that
perhaps you've encountered along the way.

17
00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:06.020
By the way you'll have an opportunity to
customize the site with your own content

18
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.151
so as we scroll on through here that's
what that looks like we have a little bit

19
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:12.013
of information about contact me.

20
00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:14.872
And then we have some links
down here on the bottom,

21
00:01:14.872 --> 00:01:18.476
this website is currently all
about me because I'm Jen Kramer.

22
00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:22.731
I would hope that you want to change all
this information to be all about you so

23
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:25.856
to have your name,
your interests and your projects and

24
00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:29.333
I'm going to give you an opportunity
to do that along the way.

25
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.463
We'll also have an about page and so

26
00:01:31.463 --> 00:01:35.581
here you'll have an about page that
looks kind of like the projects.

27
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:40.827
And by the way it's all responsive of
course so if I narrow up my screen here

28
00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:46.256
you'll see that we have a navigation
bar that's going to reformat itself.

29
00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:50.752
And underneath that we have
some projects that will reform

30
00:01:50.752 --> 00:01:55.338
themselves as well, okay, so
that is what we're going for

31
00:01:55.338 --> 00:01:59.665
today and if I was a beginning
beginner looking at that.

32
00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:04.165
I would probably feel pretty intimidated
at this moment in time because that seems

33
00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:05.860
like a pretty advanced site for

34
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.397
someone without a lot of background
knowledge and HTML and CSS.

35
00:02:09.397 --> 00:02:14.373
The trick behind this type of project is
always to think about how are we going

36
00:02:14.373 --> 00:02:16.172
to break this into pieces.

37
00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:19.433
Start with one of the simplest
pieces of this puzzle,

38
00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:24.085
work that particular problem and
in fact we're gonna work it in isolation.

39
00:02:24.085 --> 00:02:27.550
So we don't have to worry about all of
the other considerations that are there

40
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.145
on the page.

41
00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:33.096
In fact, we'll do that using code pen,
I love code pen as a tool for teaching,

42
00:02:33.096 --> 00:02:36.185
because there's no
environment to configure.

43
00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:40.695
It's just gonna give us some HTML and CSS
blocks, also gives us a JavaScript block,

44
00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:42.548
but we're not gonna use that one.

45
00:02:42.548 --> 00:02:48.181
And we can write our code, and
immediately see it rendered on this side.

46
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:50.804
So we'll do that,
we'll break this into pieces,

47
00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:54.355
we'll look at just the text here for
the opening introductory text.

48
00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:58.017
We'll look at the navbar in isolation,
we'll work at these projects,

49
00:02:58.017 --> 00:03:00.191
probably getting to that this afternoon.

50
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:02.469
And thinking about how
we're gonna make this work,

51
00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.542
including this interesting overlap
thing that we have going on here.

52
00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:09.298
And you'll do some things yourself along
the way you'll wind up coding some

53
00:03:09.298 --> 00:03:12.009
of these things all on your
own without my assistance.
