1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.873
So now that you have your homepage
completely assembled here from chapter

2
00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:08.159
six, the next thing for
you to do is all on your own,

3
00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.730
I want you to build an about page for
the website.

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.512
So, if you take a look at my screenshot
here of how this should look there,

5
00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:18.590
some parts of this that
should look familiar to you.

6
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.629
For example,
you have a navbar appear here at the top,

7
00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:24.617
kinda looks like the navbar
we already have in place.

8
00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:29.410
As is generally true on websites anyway,
we have the same sort of footer here.

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.782
And then in the middle instead
of projects we have instead

10
00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:38.960
information about me, right,
or about you, I hope.

11
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.268
So, what I'd like for you to do is
to start by taking your homepage,

12
00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:49.821
and you're gonna simply save it,
File Save As.

13
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:56.611
So, index dot HTML inside of VS code,
File Save As, call it about dot HTML.

14
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:59.085
And then take a look at
the HTML that you have there,

15
00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:02.021
think about what you need to keep and
what you need to delete,

16
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:05.560
because you don't need to keep
everything that you had on the homepage.

17
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.360
Then you wanna modify that content
to reflect your own biography.

18
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.844
Maybe drop in your own picture,
drop in your own biography, or

19
00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:20.110
you can use the provided information as
I've given it to you, that's fine too.

20
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.413
And then debug.

21
00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:25.014
So, you're gonna need to go through, you
wanna look at the navigation on the top,

22
00:01:25.014 --> 00:01:28.330
click all the links, make sure it
goes where you expect it to go.

23
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.410
Click anything else that's
clickable on the page.

24
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.710
Make sure it opens consistently either
a new windows or not new windows.

25
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.310
And if you have some extra time,
feel free to expand on your bio, or

26
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.750
add some more projects to the homepage,
or whatever it is that you would like.

27
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.691
For those of you who
are a little bit more advanced,

28
00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:54.134
I have some advanced additions for this
webpage that you could think about adding.

29
00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:56.097
And I've given you some links for
where you can go and

30
00:01:56.097 --> 00:01:58.020
read about these techniques
a little bit further.

31
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.730
So, here I've given you a link
to a CSS-only hamburger button.

32
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.756
So, I mentioned I cover how to build
this in the Frontend Masters advanced

33
00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:12.456
CSS layouts course, if you wanna
watch that portion of that course,

34
00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:16.750
here are some instructions on how
to build a CSS only drop down,

35
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.690
that is accessible you can tab through it.

36
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.550
Or you can add both of those things
to your navbar, if you wanted to.

37
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.299
You could also think about doing a contact
form instead of an Email button,

38
00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.700
that would be something to take
the site to the next level.

39
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.800
Or of course,
you could expand the project section.

40
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.296
So rather than the whole total of
the project is what you see there

41
00:02:37.296 --> 00:02:41.330
on the homepage, which is how
we currently have it configured.

42
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.750
Use that as an introduction
to your project.

43
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.927
Give it all like a read more kinda style,
kind of button, which will take you

44
00:02:48.927 --> 00:02:52.646
to another page on this website that
will give you much more detail,

45
00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:56.367
maybe some more screenshots,
a link to the actual project itself,

46
00:02:56.367 --> 00:03:00.710
that type of thing as individual separate
pages for the rest of the website.

47
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.260
That would be something for you to do.

48
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.414
So, what I'd like for you to do now
though, is just very simply to build,

49
00:03:07.414 --> 00:03:09.150
this about page.

50
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.534
And, we're gonna give you just
five minutes to go through and

51
00:03:12.534 --> 00:03:14.470
put this page together.

52
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.170
And, then I will talk to you about how
I approach this particular problem.

53
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.741
So, go ahead and give it a try, and

54
00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:24.084
I'll talk to you about
the answer in just a minute.

55
00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:37.350
All right, so hopefully that about
page went pretty well for you.

56
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.942
There actually wasn't a ton
of work to do believe it or

57
00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:41.920
not to create that about page.

58
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.420
You've already done most of
the work on the homepage.

59
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.671
It's a matter now for the about page of
scaling back all the work that you did for

60
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:52.102
the homepage to just the parts
that you need for the about page.

61
00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:56.919
So, let's talk through my answers here and
we'll start here with the CSS,

62
00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:01.195
and what you'll see here in
the CSS is that nothing changed.

63
00:04:01.195 --> 00:04:04.207
We already had all of
the styling written for

64
00:04:04.207 --> 00:04:07.067
the homepage and this is a subset of that.

65
00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:11.863
And so, the projects layout that we
used on the homepage is gonna carry

66
00:04:11.863 --> 00:04:13.570
into the about page.

67
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.874
So, there really isn't any tweaks
that you need to make here for that,

68
00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:21.550
all the changes happen in the HTML,
what changes there are.

69
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.827
So, let's start on down here at
the very bottom of our HTML document,

70
00:04:26.827 --> 00:04:29.340
this is the footer nothing changed.

71
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.416
Footer is exactly the way
it was on the homepage,

72
00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:35.400
shockingly, I know, you can't believe it.

73
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.430
Then we have our gradient bar that
comes right before the footer.

74
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.700
Then you're going to simply repurpose
the portfolio section of the page.

75
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.819
So, the ID here is still called portfolio,
even though or

76
00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.147
projects, sorry,
the idea here is still called projects,

77
00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:03.900
even though you have got this
existing already on your homepage.

78
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.334
So, what we have going on here very
simply is one of those projects, so

79
00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:13.210
instead of here are the projects I'm
proud of, this is now Jen Kramer.

80
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.470
Then we have our article,
we have our image, and we have our text.

81
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.690
It's all just listed right here.

82
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.840
And then we have a gradient
bar in between those.

83
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.420
And then up here on the top of the page,
we have our navigation.

84
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.130
Now, There we probably need to make
a few tweaks to this navigation.

85
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.850
Let's just take a quick
peek at how this works.

86
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.020
So, if we open this up, here we go,

87
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:49.780
open this up in our default browser,
so it looks good, right?

88
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.580
But always go through and
click your buttons on the top.

89
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.440
So, here's one of the things that
happens when you click on projects.

90
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.642
May wanna make sure it goes back
to the homepage projects and

91
00:06:00.642 --> 00:06:03.660
not to the page that you're on.

92
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.054
So one of the changes that
hopefully you made, was for

93
00:06:07.054 --> 00:06:09.400
something like that projects link.

94
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.097
It says here index.html,
and then that hashtag or

95
00:06:14.097 --> 00:06:17.820
pound sign followed by that ID, write?

96
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.500
The portfolio or the projects
depending on which ID you are using.

97
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.832
You wanna be sure to go
back to the homepage,

98
00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:26.300
and then skip down to
that section of the page.

99
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.400
If you just left this with only the ID,
okay?

100
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.851
And save this, and let me go back,

101
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:39.640
refresh this page, and click on projects.

102
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.335
You're actually gonna skip down to
your bio by default, all right?

103
00:06:44.335 --> 00:06:46.731
So, you need to always
double check your links and

104
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:49.480
make sure that they're doing
what you expect them to do.

105
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.800
This about page should link to itself, you
should be able to click on Jen Kramer and

106
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.390
go back to the homepage and
make sure that that is working correctly.

107
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.341
Make sure that when you click on
the Contact link that is linking you to

108
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:06.190
the appropriate section
of the page as well.

109
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.898
So, all of that it's very,
very important to go through and

110
00:07:09.898 --> 00:07:14.425
check all of those links and make sure
that that is all working correctly.

111
00:07:14.425 --> 00:07:20.400
So, double check all of that as you
put that webpage together, finally.
