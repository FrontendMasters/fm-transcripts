1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.480
Let's go ahead and
start styling this then.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.420
The place I'm gonna start is
styling the blue background.

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.300
And we kind of have already
seen this pattern in effect.

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.395
If you think back to that
contact section that we did,

5
00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:22.590
where we have our plum background
color for the section, okay?

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.204
We could do the same thing here for
the background color for

7
00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:30.600
the project's portion of the screen,
this should be blue, okay?

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.880
So let's set that up here,
sure, fork this, there we go.

9
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.758
So the way to do that,
of course here in our CSS,

10
00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:49.330
we'll scroll on down here to
all around line 64 or so.

11
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.954
And we can add our section-blue class or

12
00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:58.990
dark blue I guess is
what I called it DK blue.

13
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.252
And we're going to have a background
color of that dark blue,

14
00:01:05.252 --> 00:01:08.077
that's the name from the variable.

15
00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:16.450
Okay, and then we need to, of course,

16
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.320
apply it to the work here,
so let's put in that div.

17
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.796
And that div is gonna go where?

18
00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:29.410
It's gonna go around the whole section
because the section may have a limited

19
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.110
width to it, but the blue background color
is gonna go all the way across the page.

20
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.370
So we'll add that here,

21
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.189
div with class of section-dkblue.

22
00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:52.850
And we'll close that div down
here at the bottom, okay?

23
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.860
So now we have a nice blue
background to work with.

24
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.940
And of course, that's gonna be
limited to our particular projects.

25
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.250
And then we're ready to
style up the rest of this.

26
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.475
As you take a look at the project section
here you can see that we've got our

27
00:02:07.475 --> 00:02:11.720
text and our images are smashing
into the edges of our window here.

28
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.353
So the first thing to do is to make
sure we give this a little bit of

29
00:02:14.353 --> 00:02:15.580
breathing room.

30
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.787
If you take a look back at the CSS
that we've written so far,

31
00:02:18.787 --> 00:02:22.058
we've got 4 rems of space pretty
consistently at the top and

32
00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:26.190
the bottom of things like the footer,
and the introduction, and so forth.

33
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.590
We've actually got a little more space
at the bottom of the introduction, so

34
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.510
we should probably continue
with that pattern.

35
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.921
And so what we'll do here and
I'm just scroll down to just

36
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:42.900
before the media queries,
we go, right on in here.

37
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.330
And so what I'm gonna do was put
in a comment projects section.

38
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.893
And so for the projects section overall,

39
00:02:55.893 --> 00:03:01.609
we can give that a padding of 4rem 1rem,
right,

40
00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.750
that should get it off the edges
of the page very nice.

41
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.041
And then for projects,
h2, let's address that,

42
00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:20.950
so this has got a default font size here.

43
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.173
What we'd like to do is
change that a little bit,

44
00:03:25.173 --> 00:03:30.426
I think I have it a little bit bigger and
give it some different

45
00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:35.690
space here on the bottom, so
my font size will be 2.5rem.

46
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.974
And my margin on the bottom, What I have

47
00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:47.271
here is the following, I really would
like it to be if my font size is 2.5rem.

48
00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:52.011
I would like to be consistent with
my line height, so in other words,

49
00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:54.970
I'd like to have 1.5 times 2.5rem.

50
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.530
And I could work that math if I wanted
to or I could use something like calc.

51
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.548
So calc is this little function that will
do math for you how awesome is that,

52
00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:14.805
and so
we could just simply say 2.5rem times 1.5.

53
00:04:14.805 --> 00:04:19.446
So this is sort of a very brief
introduction to calc that's

54
00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:21.410
as simple as calc gets.

55
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.570
We can multiply two numbers, we can add
them, we can subtract them, and so forth.

56
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.910
Calc is of course compatible
with things like variables.

57
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.893
So if I had a number stored in a variable
we've used variables in this project,

58
00:04:33.893 --> 00:04:38.065
their colors and their fonts,
we can't add and subtract those.

59
00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:41.868
But if we had numbers somewhere
inside of those variables,

60
00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:46.670
we could do math with those
particular variables if we wanted to.

61
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.690
And again, there's other courses
on the front end masters library.

62
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.281
They'll go into calc in more detail,
including my advanced layouts course, but

63
00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:55.060
for right now that's what's going on.

64
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.011
We're gonna take our font size,
which was 2.5rem, and

65
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:01.445
we're gonna multiply it by 1.5 to
give us a little bit more space.

66
00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:08.453
Make that text a little bigger and give us
space between that and our next project.

67
00:05:08.453 --> 00:05:12.818
For projects, H3,

68
00:05:12.818 --> 00:05:17.455
we know from our drawing,
we wanted that to be aqua and

69
00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:21.387
color, so
let's set that up color bar aqua.

70
00:05:24.717 --> 00:05:27.760
So that should make the words
wall of wonder are aqua color.

71
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.245
The h4 the latest project and
the technologies used including we're

72
00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:39.719
gonna have to do some changes to that,
so for our projects h4.

73
00:05:41.214 --> 00:05:45.244
We wanna have a font size
of something like one rim,

74
00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:50.620
it's much smaller than the rest
of the text that's here.

75
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.705
And we're also going to want
to set our font family.

76
00:05:57.484 --> 00:06:05.810
To var mono, so it has that
typewriter font look to it, okay?

77
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.348
And then we have that issue
of in our website here,

78
00:06:10.348 --> 00:06:14.196
latest project, and
wall of wonder are very close together,

79
00:06:14.196 --> 00:06:18.280
there's actually very little
space in between those.

80
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.940
Whereas in our CodePen,
we have a lot of space right now.

81
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.006
So that space is coming from the headings
by default have some margin associated

82
00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:27.210
with them.

83
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.410
And we did zero out our margin way up
here in the beginning of the document.

84
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.290
We zeroed out the margin for our h1, h2,

85
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.502
and h3 up here back up more online for
h3 or so.

86
00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:47.545
So now that space is coming
strictly from the h4 and

87
00:06:47.545 --> 00:06:53.027
we can get rid of that just
by saying margin 0 and

88
00:06:53.027 --> 00:06:58.340
that will remove that particular space.

89
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.470
Okay, the space that's here
now between the paragraph and

90
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.609
technologies used include
which is an h4 and

91
00:07:05.609 --> 00:07:10.250
the space between that technologies
used to include and the list.

92
00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:15.260
So that top space is coming from
the paragraph which has a margin on

93
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.793
the bottom by default from your browser.

94
00:07:17.793 --> 00:07:20.640
And the space here between
the technologies and

95
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.782
the actual technologies that we're
using that comes from the list.

96
00:07:26.262 --> 00:07:28.123
So that's why those
spaces are still there.

97
00:07:30.644 --> 00:07:34.150
All right, now back to our HTML here, so

98
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:40.200
again in my diagram here I've got
my two headings all styled up.

99
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.671
But this big paragraph here we're gonna
need to turn that into a black box

100
00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:45.485
aren't we?

101
00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:49.040
We need to have a nice dark
background on it, we need around

102
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.630
some corners probably put some padding
on it, so let's make that happen.

103
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.198
I'm actually gonna start by putting
a class on that paragraph and

104
00:08:01.198 --> 00:08:05.831
I'm gonna call it black box because
that's what we're gonna do to it,

105
00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:08.010
we're gonna make it a black box.

106
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.100
And then,
we can write our style down here.

107
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:20.573
Class of black box, will look as follows,

108
00:08:20.573 --> 00:08:29.082
it's gonna have a bit of
a background color, bar black.

109
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.333
So there you go now you can see that,
okay,

110
00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:36.780
if you can't see it you can't style it.

111
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.902
So by putting things like background
colors and borders on your CSS first helps

112
00:08:40.902 --> 00:08:43.900
to point you in direction as
to what you should do next, so

113
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.780
if you're just thinking, well,
I just need a black background.

114
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.770
There it is, well, we're not quite there
yet, so let's keep adding to that.

115
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.711
One of the things that we should probably
do is give it some padding, like 1rem,

116
00:08:57.711 --> 00:09:00.630
give it a little bit of breathing room,
right?

117
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.070
We don't want it smashed into the edges of
the box, then we can round the corners.

118
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.627
Border radius maybe
something like 10 pixels.

119
00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:21.124
So there we go there's the nice
rounded corners that we

120
00:09:21.124 --> 00:09:25.751
were looking for
we can set the text color to white.

121
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.372
Okay, so there's the white for
the website,

122
00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:34.621
you can also change our font size.

123
00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:45.059
1rem because it is a little bit smaller
than what we have here by default and

124
00:09:45.059 --> 00:09:49.310
we can set our line height to 1.5.

125
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.864
Remember once again 1.5 just a ratio,
not an absolute unit of measure, and

126
00:09:53.864 --> 00:09:58.850
then that'll give you a little bit of
breathing room there in that black box.

127
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.014
Looking better already, isn't it?

128
00:10:01.014 --> 00:10:06.467
Yeah, okay, so let's see here,

129
00:10:06.467 --> 00:10:10.981
so we've got the headings,

130
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:14.943
those are looking good.

131
00:10:14.943 --> 00:10:17.202
We've got our paragraph
that's looking good,

132
00:10:17.202 --> 00:10:20.270
let's take a look at this next
one here then our technologies.

133
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:26.910
We have our three technologies here, so
that's all looking the way it should.

134
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.187
But these three technologies are still
set up as a bulleted list and

135
00:10:30.187 --> 00:10:32.952
we wanna have them going
horizontally across the page.

136
00:10:36.132 --> 00:10:39.324
So hopefully some of this you can
get that by now cuz we've only done

137
00:10:39.324 --> 00:10:41.538
this like three or
four times at this point.

138
00:10:41.538 --> 00:10:46.565
So projects, Ul, we're gonna have

139
00:10:46.565 --> 00:10:51.760
that be our list, style type of none.

140
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:59.241
Turn off the bullets, turn off the extra
padding associated with this or

141
00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:02.507
our padding zero and our margin is zero,

142
00:11:02.507 --> 00:11:06.181
turn off all of that, so
there we go for that.

143
00:11:09.681 --> 00:11:13.194
Then we're gonna want this to
go in a horizontal line, so

144
00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:14.960
we can do that with Flexbox.

145
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.216
Display Flex.

146
00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:24.830
Right, flex flow row wrap.

147
00:11:28.074 --> 00:11:33.130
And then we want to have this left
aligned then we're gonna have our

148
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:39.380
justify content set to flex start in other
words set up to this the start of the row.

149
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.175
The reason I'm declaring this here
that is the default value for

150
00:11:43.175 --> 00:11:48.022
Flexbox, but I'm gonna just declare it
anyway because I'm gonna change it later

151
00:11:48.022 --> 00:11:50.079
than a couple of other scenarios.

152
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:57.160
Obviously the words all run into
each other that's not good,

153
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.180
so let's put in a gap, 1rem, there we go.

154
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.461
And it's a little bit big, so
let's reduce our font size to 1rem.

155
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:16.110
Right, not so bad, okay, so
the last part of this, is this image.

156
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:21.025
So right now we have our image
crashed into our technologies and

157
00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:26.990
the way that we want it to look we
need a little bit more breathing room.

158
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.260
And then we have this weird
effect going on here.

159
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.100
This is that line that kind of
goes around on two sides and

160
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.670
it isn't quite touching the image, so
let's think about an approach for this.

161
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.116
We have our image here in place, maybe
what we need to do is put in a border,

162
00:12:45.116 --> 00:12:49.607
we wanna put a border on two sides of this
image, we wanna put it on the top, and

163
00:12:49.607 --> 00:12:51.290
we want to put it on the left.

164
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.550
But if you just put on the border,
it's going to touch the image itself.

165
00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.030
So how do we get space between
the border and the image?

166
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.472
We use padding,
should you put in a little bit of padding,

167
00:13:03.472 --> 00:13:08.490
that's gonna get the border off the edge
of the image, and then round the corners.

168
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.250
And that'll give you
the cool round corner here.

169
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:15.990
And it just so happens to be, this is how
CSS treats the edges of the border here.

170
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.598
It actually is kind of a cool effect,
it sort of curves just a little bit

171
00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:23.660
right there on the edges, so
that's where that comes from.

172
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.174
So now all we have to do is just
write the code for that no big deal.

173
00:13:30.158 --> 00:13:34.100
So this will be then the project's image.

174
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:43.683
And what we'll do, first of all,
let's get it away from the text and

175
00:13:43.683 --> 00:13:50.128
give it all some breathing room,
so margin 2rem 0 4rem 0.

176
00:13:50.128 --> 00:13:55.117
So give me a little bit of space here
between my technologies in the picture and

177
00:13:55.117 --> 00:13:58.520
it'll give me a lot of space
down here on the bottom.

178
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:07.506
Then we can say border, left,
one pixel solid var aqua,

179
00:14:07.506 --> 00:14:15.480
so that's something new that we
haven't actually looked at before.

180
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.040
You might have guessed that with these CSS
variables, you can put them in anywhere.

181
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.030
So far we've done things like a font color
or a background color, that kind of thing.

182
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.950
But here you can actually substitute in
that variable right for your border color.

183
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:35.015
So instead of one pixel solid red,
it's one pixel

184
00:14:35.015 --> 00:14:40.328
solid var aqua, okay, so
that's the border left.

185
00:14:40.328 --> 00:14:48.285
And then we just change
the next one to border top,

186
00:14:48.285 --> 00:14:52.470
there we go, top, okay?

187
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.412
And then we can give this a border radius,

188
00:14:59.388 --> 00:15:04.880
Let's say 25 pixels, okay, so
that's gonna round things up a little bit.

189
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.213
So if your eyes are really good, you can
see that we now have an aqua line going

190
00:15:09.213 --> 00:15:12.440
across the top of the image and
down the side.

191
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.570
But it's a just like I said the border
is right on top of the image.

192
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.939
To give it a little bit of space
as you know, from the box model,

193
00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:24.290
the distance between the content in
the border is the padding, right?

194
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:29.432
No different here,
even though it's an image instead

195
00:15:29.432 --> 00:15:34.126
of text that distance is
still called padding, so

196
00:15:34.126 --> 00:15:37.159
let's add that padding 1rem.

197
00:15:40.848 --> 00:15:45.630
And that will move your image away
from that border, cool effect.

198
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.070
So you've actually seen that many
places on the web sometimes you'll see

199
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.800
a thumbnail effect, with or
without those rounded corners.

200
00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.780
If you see that sort of border that
goes around the office a little square

201
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.442
picture or something.

202
00:16:02.442 --> 00:16:06.801
And it's got sort of looks like a frame
on the picture it's on all four

203
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:09.058
sides that's that same idea here,

204
00:16:09.058 --> 00:16:14.043
all we've done is just put it on two sides
instead of putting on all four sides.

205
00:16:14.043 --> 00:16:15.918
And there you go, that wasn't so scary.

206
00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:21.165
We have now coded your first project for
the mobile dimension, not bad.
