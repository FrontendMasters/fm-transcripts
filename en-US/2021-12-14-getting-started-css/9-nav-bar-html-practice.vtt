00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
Navbars are some of my favorite
things in the whole world.

2
00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:08.389
Because I think you can teach pretty much
all of web development [LAUGH] in terms of

3
00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.325
HTML and CSS inside of a navbar.

4
00:00:10.325 --> 00:00:12.370
You learn good semantic markup.

5
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.704
You learn all kinds of
crazy layout tricks.

6
00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:18.235
You learn all kinds of interesting
things about the cascade and

7
00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:22.306
selectors and all the rest of it,
sort of a little microcosm of web page.

8
00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:24.072
And, of course, they're highly relevant.

9
00:00:24.072 --> 00:00:26.393
What is a web page without a navbar?

10
00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:32.134
So we'll start here and
I'm going to give this to you to do first.

11
00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:36.701
Creating the correct markup for
a navbar inside of a CodePen.

12
00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:39.929
So let's take a look at
our beginning CodePen.

13
00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.927
As you see here, I have copied
over the CSS as it exists so far.

14
00:00:44.927 --> 00:00:48.145
That's the CSS from the intro
exercise that we did,

15
00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:51.008
the CSS from the contact
exercise that we did.

16
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:56.356
And I have given you, here's what our
navigation will ultimately look like.

17
00:00:56.356 --> 00:01:01.482
You're gonna put in your name, and
then there's a series of links here.

18
00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:04.819
And so what I would like for
you to do now, is I would like for

19
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.470
you to give a pass at this,.

20
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.198
Take like five minutes and

21
00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:13.160
think about how you would go about
marking up this navbar in a semantic way.

22
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.652
Remember that this is a list of links,
hint hint.

23
00:01:18.652 --> 00:01:22.766
It is a list of links, so
you'll need to put in a link.

24
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.100
It doesn't have to go anywhere.

25
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.990
We can worry about that part later.

26
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.244
It's a list doesn't matter what
he's links in, it probably doesn't.

27
00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:37.273
So that should sort of trigger something
else for you in terms of the HTML.

28
00:01:37.273 --> 00:01:40.664
Its navigation,
its major navigation for the web page,

29
00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:43.711
that should trigger another
HTML element for you.

30
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:48.149
And we had talked about that there's an H1
in here somewhere as the most important

31
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.935
part of this.

32
00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:55.610
So think about all of that, and take a
first pass at marking this up as a navbar.

33
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.650
And I'm gonna talk you through
the answer here in just a moment and

34
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.037
see what you can do in terms
of just marking this up.

35
00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:07.463
Don't worry about how it looks just yet.

36
00:02:07.463 --> 00:02:09.102
How did you do that?.

37
00:02:09.102 --> 00:02:11.754
Hopefully, you did okay
with that navbar markup.

38
00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:13.459
Navbars are really again,

39
00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.512
one of the things I really love because
the markup is pretty much always the same.

40
00:02:18.512 --> 00:02:22.550
And very few people are doing it
correctly at this point in time.

41
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.369
A navigation bar is a list of links
that can be visited in any order.

42
00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:32.292
So it's a list that should immediately
trigger in your head one of the types of

43
00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:34.351
HTML lists that are available.

44
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:38.603
UL for an unordered list,
OL for an ordered list, or

45
00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:43.737
if you're super fancy,
maybe even DL for a description list.

46
00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:46.497
I'm sure there's several
choices to choose from but

47
00:02:46.497 --> 00:02:49.517
that doesn't matter what order
you visit those links in.

48
00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:52.558
There isn't a first thing to do or
a second thing to do and

49
00:02:52.558 --> 00:02:54.640
we don't have pairs of information.

50
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.568
So that means that the unordered list
is going to be the foundation of

51
00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:01.214
how our navbar works.

52
00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:06.157
Then we're going to flag it with
the nav element in order to set this as

53
00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:08.810
the main navigation on our webpage.

54
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.680
It's not any list of links,
it is our navigation.

55
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.417
And so that's why we have a nav tag there.

56
00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:18.776
So that is the foundation of any
navbar that you ever code from now on.

57
00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:21.419
Now a lot of developers look at this and
they go, man,

58
00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.683
that just looks like a lot
of extra HTML markup.

59
00:03:23.683 --> 00:03:27.793
Well, let me tell you,
having all those extra elements will wind

60
00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:31.468
it making styling a lot easier and
a lot more interesting.

61
00:03:31.468 --> 00:03:35.320
It also enhances
accessibility along the way.

62
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.833
So here's my CodePen and
how I marked this up.

63
00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.322
Some of this should be pretty
straightforward for you.

64
00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:45.447
So there's that navigation,
it starts here at the beginning and

65
00:03:45.447 --> 00:03:48.004
it closes at the end of this whole thing.

66
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:53.315
Inside of that is our unordered list,
starting and ending unordered list.

67
00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:56.592
And then we have a series
of navigation items.

68
00:03:56.592 --> 00:03:58.838
They start with an LI,
they end with an LI.

69
00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:02.028
Inside of that, we have links.

70
00:04:02.028 --> 00:04:04.836
And I think all of that's
pretty straightforward.

71
00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:06.883
Where are the curveballs?

72
00:04:06.883 --> 00:04:11.799
Curveballs are here, so here on line five,
that's where I put my H1.

73
00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.798
Now you may not have seen that kind of
markup before where you have an LI.

74
00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:18.601
Inside of that, we have an H1.

75
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:21.536
That is the main heading for
an entire webpage, but

76
00:04:21.536 --> 00:04:23.523
this is valid legitimate markup.

77
00:04:23.523 --> 00:04:27.806
A heading element is allowed
inside of a list item.

78
00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:33.260
And that will ultimately be my logo,
it's gonna be a text based logo.

79
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.661
But my logo for the web page is
going to be that H1 right there.

80
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:40.599
And I have set that to link to itself.

81
00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:44.869
Ultimately, it's we're gonna
make a page called index.HTML,

82
00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:48.462
which is historically,
the homepage of your website.

83
00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:50.848
So that's why I've linked that there.

84
00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:54.959
Then we're going to have a link to
the projects section of our webpage,

85
00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.615
we haven't built that yet.

86
00:04:56.615 --> 00:05:02.216
But you can set that up there
by linking to pound projects,

87
00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:08.291
or pound contact, pound hash tag
is the other one, of course.

88
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:12.784
So the way you set up that
linking inside of the same page

89
00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:15.921
simply linked to that particular ID.

90
00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:18.740
So by hashtag contact here,

91
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.617
we're skipping down to the section
with the ID of contact.

92
00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:26.717
Okay, so that's what all of that is.

93
00:05:26.717 --> 00:05:28.420
I have a link to my LinkedIn.

94
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.708
I have a link to my GitHub, and
I have a link to my resume.

95
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:36.743
I prefer to make things that go
off site open in a new window.

96
00:05:36.743 --> 00:05:40.764
I know some people feel very strongly
about this going the other way that

97
00:05:40.764 --> 00:05:43.256
everything should open in the same window.

98
00:05:43.256 --> 00:05:47.397
My advice to you is you can do either
of those things just be consistent.

99
00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:50.831
We want them to all either all the links
go upside open a new windows or

100
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:52.526
they all open in the same window.

101
00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:54.840
Whatever way it is that you
want to choose how to do that.
