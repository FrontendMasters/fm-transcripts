1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.959
So, now we're gonna style
this particular text and

2
00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.160
you have the website to refer to take
a look at colors and all the rest of that.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.359
Where I'm going to actually start
is at the end point here and

4
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.122
I'm gonna walk you through this part
of this because I wanna be sure that

5
00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:20.210
everybody gets they're starting
CSS set up the same way that I do.

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.455
So I'm going to go a jump briefly
to the end point of part three, so

7
00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:27.910
this is chapter two part
three the ending code pen.

8
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.677
And this is where we're going to make it
pretty and I'm gonna walk you through this

9
00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:37.257
part of this because I want you to be sure
to start your CSS the same way that I do.

10
00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:40.845
And I'm actually gonna start at the ending
code pen here because we're gonna copy

11
00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:43.459
over a big chunk of text that
I've already written for you.

12
00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:48.704
I'm so nice that way, so here In the CSS
for the ending state of part three,

13
00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:53.575
and then we'll walk through
how to actually style this.

14
00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:57.505
We are going to go just up here
at the very top of this document.

15
00:00:57.505 --> 00:00:59.315
Now this may be new to some of you.

16
00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:04.195
This is the concept of CSS variables,
also called CSS custom properties.

17
00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:08.059
This is not a course on variables and
custom properties, but

18
00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:12.910
they are incredibly useful for spelling
out things we're gonna use over and

19
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.380
over again, in this case,
colors and font stacks.

20
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.760
And I think I even have
a font size in here.

21
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.410
So variables work just
like you would expect.

22
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.390
You remember about variables from algebra,
x equals three.

23
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.370
So x plus four equals seven.

24
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.630
What is the value of x?

25
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.268
It must be three, right this is
the same concept here inside of CSS.

26
00:01:34.268 --> 00:01:38.676
So what we do to set this up we have
these available globally to us so

27
00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:42.783
in other words we can use these
anywhere in our CSS document.

28
00:01:42.783 --> 00:01:48.198
To set it up we use this colon route and
that is called a pseudo class,

29
00:01:48.198 --> 00:01:52.050
it indicates this is
the top of our document.

30
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.042
Now, you might be thinking
well why not just HTML?

31
00:01:56.042 --> 00:02:02.140
Two reasons, one there is a before and
an after associated with HTML.

32
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.588
And by using route we're gonna
encompass all of the things everywhere,

33
00:02:05.588 --> 00:02:08.010
right, the entire document object model.

34
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.000
Second thing is has to
do with specificity.

35
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.378
So, a pseudo class is more
heavily weighted in the cascade,

36
00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:19.785
than a simple HTML element like HTML.

37
00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:22.800
[LAUGH] So this is going to weigh
thing a little more heavily,

38
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.970
give us a little bit more specificity, and

39
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.070
potentially overrides some other things
that we might do in our documents.

40
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.410
So, this tends to be what people
do in order to set this up.

41
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.920
And so, here I have my entire color
scheme, you start each of these variables

42
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.430
with double dash and you give it a name
and that name can be anything you want.

43
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.330
And I could have called
this George Salmon, Mary.

44
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.950
But I call these by
the names of the colors.

45
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.977
Some people would say that that is
a completely wrong way of doing things

46
00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:55.599
because now I'm associating a hex
code with a name for a color and

47
00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.610
what happens if we
change things over time?

48
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.980
That's fair.

49
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.541
That's why you often see things like
primary color, secondary color and so

50
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.850
forth inside of stylesheets.

51
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.546
But I'd also argue that it's pretty rare
that companies change their branding.

52
00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:16.136
And that if your graphic design
team has named these colors,

53
00:03:16.136 --> 00:03:20.816
which, our graphic design team
totally named these colors,

54
00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:25.766
then you can just use those words
that will refer back to some style

55
00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:30.923
guide that you might have access to and
map those colors back there.

56
00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:35.750
The second part of this has to do
with the border box model here.

57
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.290
And you can read about that at CSS tricks.

58
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.090
They'll explain the border box model and
how that works.

59
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.920
It's also explained in the front
end masters boot camp.

60
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.448
We wanna work with the border box
model and so to make that happen,

61
00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:53.297
we need to have a declaration here,
that will set us at the border box and

62
00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:55.760
then set us up to inherit from there.

63
00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.394
So basically what I'd like for
you to do is to copy lines, one to 22.

64
00:04:00.394 --> 00:04:02.061
We're just gonna copy that.

65
00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:06.480
And we're going to paste it into the code
pen that we're about to start working on.

66
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.170
You can get rid of this body font
family of Arial that was just there to

67
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.610
keep the text from looking too awful.

68
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.870
And we are set and
ready to go there, okay?

69
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.430
So that gives you that baseline so
we can refer to those colors later on.

70
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.296
Now, if you're using your
own custom color scheme,

71
00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:28.863
feel free to swap in your own colors
here and set that up according to

72
00:04:28.863 --> 00:04:32.920
whatever color scheme it is that you
are using for your particular site.

73
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.240
So let's go ahead then and start setting
up the rest of this particular document.

74
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.780
First of all, we would like to set
up the styling for this web page.

75
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.380
And I always like to do this
using the body element.

76
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.371
And the body element of course
encompasses pretty much

77
00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:53.440
everything that's visible on the web page.

78
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.793
By default, your browser will put
either padding or margin on it.

79
00:04:58.793 --> 00:05:03.655
So anytime you've seen that situation
let's just say we have a background

80
00:05:03.655 --> 00:05:05.900
color of blue just for the moment.

81
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.263
Here on this page actually let
me change that the section

82
00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:13.848
color with a background color
of blue there that's better.

83
00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:18.710
See how we get that weird white wrapper
around that whole thing there and

84
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.996
the color doesn't stretch all the way
up to the edges of your browser window.

85
00:05:23.996 --> 00:05:28.034
The reason why is that the body
element has either padding or

86
00:05:28.034 --> 00:05:32.840
margin on it and it depends on
what browser you're looking at.

87
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.693
So what we do here to get
around that particular

88
00:05:38.693 --> 00:05:45.911
problem is if we say our padding is 0,
and our margin is 0

89
00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:54.185
Later if we say our section has
now a background color of blue,

90
00:05:54.185 --> 00:06:00.250
now you see that stretches all
the way across the page, okay?

91
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.194
We have an issue with the top and
the bottom that's a different issue that

92
00:06:03.194 --> 00:06:05.132
actually doesn't relate
to the body element.

93
00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:07.901
But that we just solve
that particular problem

94
00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:12.260
now we can have color that goes all
the way to the edges of the screen.

95
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.089
So then the next thing I
like to do is set up all of

96
00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:20.200
my default fonts that I'm going to use,
we can always override those later.

97
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.290
And I'm going to set up some colors and
some font sizes as well.

98
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.550
And I'm gonna make use of all of
these variables that I just set.

99
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.770
So I set all of this stuff up.

100
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.520
It's stored out there.

101
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.504
We know if when I type in a color
of black, what to display, but

102
00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:39.750
I haven't actually called any of
these variables yet in my CSS.

103
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.050
So here's the way we do that.

104
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.443
We're gonna say our font
family has a variable this

105
00:06:47.443 --> 00:06:51.980
is the way you do this,
of the name science.

106
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.302
So all you have to type do is type in var,
v-a-r is in variable,

107
00:06:56.302 --> 00:07:00.940
two parentheses and then inside of it,
the name of the variable.

108
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.010
So these are the names of the variables.

109
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.783
In this case, we want Oxygen,
sansaraf, and so

110
00:07:06.783 --> 00:07:09.920
that will load in that particular font.

111
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.410
Now we have an issue, don't we?

112
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.230
This is actually Ariel
that's displaying here.

113
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.390
Why is that?

114
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.496
Because here we've said Oxygen, sansaraf.

115
00:07:20.496 --> 00:07:23.040
Oxygen isn't loaded in this document yet.

116
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.430
And so right now it's pulling in
the defaults on saraf for my web browser.

117
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.360
That happens to be Ariel.

118
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.400
We need to go and
get Oxygen and Oxygen Mono.

119
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.590
So, let's do that now.

120
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.505
If you open up another tab, we'll go to

121
00:07:38.505 --> 00:07:43.490
fonts.google.com and
if we search for Oxygen,

122
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.610
you can click on that later oxygen and
Oxygen Mono.

123
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.451
Those are the two that we need actually,
if you click on Oxygen,

124
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:56.590
the one that we're going
to use is just the regular.

125
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:02.478
So we'll select this style and
then we can click the back button,

126
00:08:02.478 --> 00:08:05.369
then we'll go to Oxygen Mono and

127
00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:10.845
we only have one choice there,
so we'll select that style.

128
00:08:10.845 --> 00:08:14.769
If you want the bold for Oxygen for
some headings or whatever,

129
00:08:14.769 --> 00:08:19.600
feel free you can add additional ones
remember that every font that you add,

130
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.808
adds to your overall page weight.

131
00:08:21.808 --> 00:08:24.402
In the world of HTML and CSS web pages,

132
00:08:24.402 --> 00:08:29.837
it's the probably the biggest source of
page weight comes from either images,

133
00:08:29.837 --> 00:08:33.680
or it may come from some
of these particular fonts.

134
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.089
But remember, we don't have 400
megabytes of JavaScript to worry about,

135
00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:38.480
which is really nice.

136
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.370
So we have a little bit more
flexibility in our font choices.

137
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.143
So this will give us here some code for

138
00:08:46.143 --> 00:08:50.769
incorporating these
fonts into our web page.

139
00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:55.755
You're gonna need to make this work in
code pen, you're gonna need to modify

140
00:08:55.755 --> 00:08:59.434
this just a little bit and
what I want you to do is look for,

141
00:08:59.434 --> 00:09:03.134
we blow the screen up just a little bit so
you can see this.

142
00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:07.816
Over here where they give you the code,
you wanna take this little bit

143
00:09:07.816 --> 00:09:12.645
here where it says link h ref and
just copy the URL part of that.

144
00:09:12.645 --> 00:09:15.135
Okay, so I'm gonna copy that.

145
00:09:15.135 --> 00:09:18.625
And then here in code pen,
we'll go to our settings.

146
00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:24.445
We'll go to CSS, and down here where
it says external style sheets and pens.

147
00:09:24.445 --> 00:09:29.347
We will paste in our particular URL
that we just copied from there and

148
00:09:29.347 --> 00:09:31.159
then say Save and Close.

149
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.152
And then it should refresh and

150
00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:37.308
you should see the Oxygen font
displaying there on the page.

151
00:09:37.308 --> 00:09:41.990
&gt;&gt; What's the difference between
a pseudo class and a universal selector?

152
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:47.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the universal selector is gonna
have the same issue as the HTML element.

153
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.331
So, in fact, it's even worse.

154
00:09:49.331 --> 00:09:53.669
So, the universal selector which
is just basically a star if

155
00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:57.921
you remember DOS from the old
days we used to do, whatever,

156
00:09:57.921 --> 00:10:03.940
star dot doc find all the files on your
computer that had the doc ending on it.

157
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.036
And of course we use them
in command line stuff.

158
00:10:06.036 --> 00:10:11.124
Now, that star indicates all of
the elements inside of your document.

159
00:10:11.124 --> 00:10:15.762
And but again, it's not really necessarily
thinking about the full DOM as a whole,

160
00:10:15.762 --> 00:10:17.800
potentially may or may or maybe not.

161
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.320
Depending on what browser you're using.

162
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.870
But also the universal selector
has no specificity to it.

163
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.710
In other words,
if you are comparing two styles,

164
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.510
they're exactly the same, the HTML
element versus the universal selector.

165
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.930
The universal selector loses.

166
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:40.821
It's the only one of the, well one of
the only ones other than that not pseudo

167
00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:46.830
class that loses when it comes to the HTML
elements or any other HTML element.

168
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.900
And it has no specificity to it at all and
so it's very easily overwritten.

169
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.260
So again that's part of
the reason why we use root, yeah.

170
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.700
&gt;&gt; What is the double colon mean?

171
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:05.075
&gt;&gt; The double colon is a pseudo
element as opposed to a pseudo class.

172
00:11:05.075 --> 00:11:07.950
And again,
some of that has to do with specificity.

173
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.680
And some of it has to
do with functionality.

174
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.335
So the functionality piece of that,

175
00:11:13.335 --> 00:11:17.970
the pseudo class is often having
to do with some functionality.

176
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:23.002
So if we just think about links, for
example, colon link, colon visited,

177
00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:27.799
colon hover though all of those
are various states of a particular link as

178
00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:31.600
opposed to a pseudo class which
often has to do with text.

179
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.762
So before the text or after the text,
other pseudo elements are first letter.

180
00:11:37.762 --> 00:11:41.065
So the very first letter of a paragraph,
we're gonna style that

181
00:11:41.065 --> 00:11:44.569
slightly differently than all of
the rest of the entire paragraph.

182
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:49.131
That's another pseudo element,
in terms of specificity,

183
00:11:49.131 --> 00:11:52.263
pseudo elements have less specificity,

184
00:11:52.263 --> 00:11:57.273
they're online with an HTML element
as opposed to a pseudo class,

185
00:11:57.273 --> 00:12:00.990
which has specificity at
the level of a class.

186
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.108
So classes and
pseudo classes are weighted the same,

187
00:12:05.108 --> 00:12:11.690
which is higher than an HTML element and
a pseudo element weighted the same.

188
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.634
Yeah, it's a weird looking
thing here with the HTML,

189
00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:16.560
the black box sizing of border box.

190
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.210
So just briefly on that by default,
it's something called a content box.

191
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.920
Again, you can refer to the front
end masters bootcamp notes on this.

192
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.436
So what the content box
versus the border boxes,

193
00:12:28.436 --> 00:12:32.110
the box sizing property is not inherited.

194
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:37.560
And so that is why we have both HTML
here saying the box sizes is border box.

195
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.636
And then we have this whole long weirdo
series of the universal selector,

196
00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:44.266
everything before it and
everything after it,

197
00:12:44.266 --> 00:12:46.980
we're inheriting that
particular box sizing.

198
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.092
And again,
this has to do with potentially,

199
00:12:49.092 --> 00:12:51.649
there might be a reason you
wanna override this later,

200
00:12:51.649 --> 00:12:55.420
but this is typically the way
people are executing this moment.

201
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.343
There are other people that write
this slightly differently, but

202
00:12:58.343 --> 00:13:00.860
this is what you'll see pretty
commonly across the web.
