1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.654
All right, so we have one more
section here, so that's part three.

2
00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:08.488
So we've got them lined
up next to each other.

3
00:00:08.488 --> 00:00:12.590
So the last part here is
getting these cells to overlap.

4
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.443
So let's go through that now,

5
00:00:14.443 --> 00:00:18.450
and then I'm gonna have you try it
to add the additional projects.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.790
Okay, so now we are gonna use Grid
to get these projects to overlap.

7
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.637
So, as you see here in our diagram,
as you know,

8
00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:31.970
right now we have two columns
that are next to each other,

9
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.590
somehow, we need to get these
two things to overlap in space.

10
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.103
So that we get that very cool effect.
So the question is,

11
00:00:38.103 --> 00:00:41.213
how much overlap do you want?

12
00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:44.466
And as you can see from our diagram,
we want a little bit of overlap.

13
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:49.463
We don't want an excessive amount because
then we'll cover up the picture entirely.

14
00:00:49.463 --> 00:00:50.320
We don't want to do that.

15
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.476
But we want enough that we go, wow,
you got an overlap going on there,

16
00:00:54.476 --> 00:00:56.010
how cool is that?

17
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.821
All right, so

18
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:01.020
let's go back to revisit what we did
here with our grid template columns.

19
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.535
So right now we have this split
into just two columns on this page.

20
00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:08.307
One column, we have the image,
one column, we have our text.

21
00:01:08.307 --> 00:01:10.650
But we can have as many
columns as we want.

22
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.560
If we wanted to have 100 columns
on this page, we could do that.

23
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.200
It's actually really easy to do with grid,
the syntax you can do one of two ways.

24
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.700
You can either say 1FR times 100 [LAUGH]
just let it keep on going forever.

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.306
Or, you can use the shorthand
syntax which says simply

26
00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:35.940
repeat something like 100, 1FR.

27
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.689
So now I have 100 columns.

28
00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.440
There we go, and my image and my text
are assigned to the first two columns.

29
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.366
That's what you're seeing there [LAUGH]
not quite what we really had in mind.

30
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:54.470
So I'm actually gonna reduce that again,
just to ten.

31
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.070
Let's just work with ten columns.

32
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.860
Now by default, what grid will do,
is it tries very hard to think for you.

33
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.130
It's a thinking about well, you've got
ten columns, and you have two children.

34
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.484
So I'm gonna put the first child in the
first column and I'll put the second child

35
00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:16.115
in the second column and
then I guess you have eight empty columns.

36
00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:19.050
[APPLAUSE] Have a nice day says CSS grid.

37
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.057
Well, that's not exactly
what we had in mind.

38
00:02:22.057 --> 00:02:25.205
What we'd really like to have happen is,
sort of a 40 60 split.

39
00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:29.424
We'd like to have the image take up
about four of those columns, and

40
00:02:29.424 --> 00:02:33.291
we'd like to have the text take
up about six of those columns.

41
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:38.262
Actually, well, a little bit more right
seven, seven columns, eight columns, so

42
00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:40.000
that it overlaps that image.

43
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.700
And so how are we going to go about
doing that and telling grid what to do?

44
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.900
Well, that comes into some
additional syntax here.

45
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.425
So we've told the Article to do this, so

46
00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:57.520
now what we'll do is we'll say for
the project's image.

47
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.596
Now we have to tell it what
columns to display in, so

48
00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:06.130
let me give you the syntax and
then I'll explain it to you.

49
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.040
So I'm going to say grid column, so
grid column1/6, what does that mean?

50
00:03:12.903 --> 00:03:19.146
If you imagine a series of boxes on the
page, okay, so here we are on the page.

51
00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:23.975
This is line number one outside of
everything the very far left side of

52
00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:26.564
the screen that's line number one.

53
00:03:26.564 --> 00:03:29.680
Line number two is happening,
let's see, this is the image.

54
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.734
So line number two is
happening in the image,

55
00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:35.138
line three is happening in the image,
line four is happening in the image,

56
00:03:35.138 --> 00:03:36.830
line five is happening in the image.

57
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.310
Line six is happening right here
between the image and the text.

58
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.139
So we're sort of counting over,
so we count like humans,

59
00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.563
we don't start with zero,
we start with one, and

60
00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:50.534
we're starting over here on
the far left side of the screen.

61
00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:57.790
So we go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and
then that's where those numbers come from.

62
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.857
Let's do the same thing
then with our text, and for

63
00:04:01.857 --> 00:04:05.934
the text,
we'll say our grid column is 5/11.

64
00:04:05.934 --> 00:04:09.801
So since we're going 5,
6, 7, 8, 9,10,11, right?

65
00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:12.330
We're overlapping that
center column there.

66
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.612
So the image is gonna stretch
into that one column and

67
00:04:16.612 --> 00:04:20.713
now we have the text
stretching into that column.

68
00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:23.516
But grid again,
trying to be helpful but not.

69
00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:26.917
Puts these now on two
separate rows because

70
00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:30.989
you actually do have
an overlap here in the middle.

71
00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:35.105
And by default grid says,
you made a mistake, well,

72
00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:40.320
let me help you with that I'll just put
all of that stuff into another row.

73
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.309
That's what's happening here, so

74
00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:46.120
we have our image we have our
text down here in the second row.

75
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.525
So now we need to tell them no, I want
both of those things in the same row.

76
00:04:51.525 --> 00:04:59.220
So the way we do that grid-row: 1/2,
right?

77
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.085
We're gonna start at the top of
the screen, that's line number one.

78
00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:08.639
Line number two was the one after
that row, so one to two And

79
00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.040
we're gonna say that again for
the text, grid-row: 1/2.

80
00:05:15.793 --> 00:05:21.017
You did it, look at that they overlap,
you've put them all into the same row,

81
00:05:21.017 --> 00:05:23.801
you've given it some number of columns.

82
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:28.290
That was me playing around with
however many columns might work here,

83
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.789
you might find this works
just fine with 12 columns or

84
00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.765
maybe you can get away with only
using 3 columns or whatever.

85
00:05:35.765 --> 00:05:41.020
But we managed to get everything
to overlap here, just like that.

86
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.760
How cool is that?

87
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.873
You didn't believe you could do
this at the start of the course but

88
00:05:45.873 --> 00:05:47.520
here you are, you made it happen.

89
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.899
And so now as we narrow up the screen
here, this is looking pretty good,

90
00:05:54.899 --> 00:06:00.921
until we get to our break point and then
things stack on top of each other, okay?

91
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.235
Before that, there they are next to
each other and looking all right.

92
00:06:05.235 --> 00:06:06.300
How amazing is that?
