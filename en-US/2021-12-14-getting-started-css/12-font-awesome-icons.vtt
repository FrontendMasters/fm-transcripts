WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.277
Let's move on to some accessible icons.

2
00:00:03.277 --> 00:00:07.017
We're going to work with
something called Font Awesome and

3
00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:11.746
I imagine many of you have heard of
font awesome before fontawesome.com.

4
00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:18.685
Now the reason I'm using Font Awesome
here is because Font Awesome is a free or

5
00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:23.170
potentially part free part
paid font library that

6
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.460
offers a ton of icons that
are available to you.

7
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.210
So if you were to go to fontawesome.com
Click on Start for Free.

8
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.610
Let's see here or icons, I guess I
should say, up at the top navigation.

9
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.508
If you click on the icons,

10
00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:45.520
it will tell you that there are 7864
icons today, not all of them are free.

11
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.178
If you click on Free over
here in the left navigation

12
00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:53.870
only 1608 icons are free today and
this is Font Awesome five.

13
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.365
As of this recording, there is about
to be a release for Font Awesome 6, but

14
00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:02.300
we're gonna work with
Font Awesome 5 today.

15
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.355
The reason we're gonna use a font for

16
00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:08.329
doing this is just to again because
this is an introductory CSS course,

17
00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.926
we're gonna try to make things
simple when working with icons.

18
00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:16.637
Many professionals will tell you that
they prefer to work with an actual SVG,

19
00:01:16.637 --> 00:01:21.635
a Scalable Vector Graphic, which will give
you the Math for drawing these types of

20
00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:25.760
icons and incorporate those
SVGs into their document.

21
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.487
I prefer to use Font Awesome when I'm
teaching a course like this because

22
00:01:30.487 --> 00:01:35.058
with a single installation,
we have access to 1608 icons, and so

23
00:01:35.058 --> 00:01:39.220
it's easy to make changes and
swap things in and out.

24
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.310
You may also like it for
prototyping for that reason.

25
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.303
Once you have defined exactly
what icons you want to use,

26
00:01:46.303 --> 00:01:51.973
you could always go back later and swap
those out for the actual SVG Code instead.

27
00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:55.809
The reason people like SVG
better than the font itself,

28
00:01:55.809 --> 00:02:00.240
the fonts file size is much
larger than the individual SVGs.

29
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.080
It's rare that you're going to use this
entire icon set inside of your website.

30
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.894
So why load all of that stuff in,

31
00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:10.132
if you're only gonna use
a handful of icons in the first?

32
00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:12.447
But for our purposes this is perfect.

33
00:02:12.447 --> 00:02:17.096
Let's go through swapping
out the LinkedIn icon then

34
00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:21.641
I'm going to let you guys
swap out the GitHub icon and

35
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:27.780
add an icon for yourself for
whatever it is that you want to do.

36
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.072
So we are here this was at
Part 3 Adding Accessible Icon.

37
00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:37.194
So I'm gonna walk you through adding
the LinkedIn icon now So we'll

38
00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:41.850
start here inside of Font Awesome and
we are looking for an icon for LinkedIn.

39
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.045
So in the search box,
all we have to do is type in LinkedIn, and

40
00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:49.550
as it turns out,
there are two options here.

41
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.790
I prefer the one with the box.

42
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.520
If you like the other one,
that's okay too.

43
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.425
When you click on that particular icon
it's going to give you notice here, it

44
00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:04.770
will give you the option of downloading,
that's this download icon here.

45
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.610
You could download the SVG from here.

46
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.560
It'll also give you the HTML that
will call that particular icon.

47
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.890
It will give you the Unicode option
that's useful in some environments.

48
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.870
I've used that when working in Web Flow,
for example and or

49
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.590
you can copy the Unicode glyph.

50
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.100
We're gonna copy this HTML right here,
click that.

51
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.652
And then inside of our
code pane in our HTML,

52
00:03:34.652 --> 00:03:39.284
we'll scroll on back
here to our LlinkedIn and

53
00:03:39.284 --> 00:03:43.702
I am going to drop in
inside of the link itself

54
00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:51.340
Right there, I'm going to
paste in that particular code.

55
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.367
And I think I'm just going to
reformat this a little bit just so

56
00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:58.943
you can read it a little bit
better there on the screen.

57
00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:07.459
So we've got an li, we've got our a link
right and then we have this code that we

58
00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.537
just copied in from Font Awesome and
nothing is happening why is that?

59
00:04:12.537 --> 00:04:13.755
We haven't loaded the font.

60
00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:16.995
So, let's load the font.

61
00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:21.339
We're gonna go to our settings,
we're gonna go to our CSS, and

62
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.425
scroll on down here to external
style sheets and pens.

63
00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:28.951
One of the things that's great about
CodePen is it already has Font Awesome,

64
00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:29.935
accessible for you.

65
00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:35.410
So, if in the search box here at the top
we start to type in Font Awesome.

66
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.380
It'll give you in this
case version 5.15.4.

67
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.020
That's the most recent
version at the moment.

68
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.390
Click that it'll add that line of code
right here and we can say Save and Close.

69
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.367
And you'll see here now
inside of our link,

70
00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:54.482
we have our LinkedIn icon in
addition to the LinkedIn works.

71
00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:56.000
So that's pretty awesome.

72
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.316
So we're gonna make a couple of tweaks
though to the code that Font Awesome

73
00:05:01.316 --> 00:05:07.160
gives us and it has given me an I here and
I guess it's doing this because I is icon.

74
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.710
Nothing could be further from the truth.

75
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.149
The I element dates from very
early on on the web back before,

76
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:23.068
we had a lot of support for CSS, and if we
wanted to make things bold we used B and

77
00:05:23.068 --> 00:05:27.028
if we wanted to make
things italic we used I.

78
00:05:27.028 --> 00:05:32.114
Obviously, CSS came along and
we switched over to more semantic

79
00:05:32.114 --> 00:05:38.030
elements is strong and M, but B and
I have made a comeback in HTML five.

80
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.976
They mean all they mean completely
different things that have nothing to do

81
00:05:40.976 --> 00:05:42.360
with bolded and talic.

82
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.420
All right, and
they don't mean icon either.

83
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.790
So I don't particularly like this markup.

84
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.580
I prefer to use it with span,
which is a better choice.

85
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.938
So I always change this,

86
00:05:55.938 --> 00:06:00.927
to span when I work with this
if you want to leave it as I,

87
00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:05.820
it's certainly fine to do
a lot of people do that.

88
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.197
And then the other thing now that
happens in terms of accessibility,

89
00:06:10.197 --> 00:06:13.593
you want to hide the icon
from the screen readers, but

90
00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:18.441
you want your people who are browsing
this website to be able to see the icon.

91
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:22.730
But for screen readers you may want
that text that says LinkedIn but

92
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.189
you want to hide that from
people who can see the icon.

93
00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:30.307
So we need to do a little bit of
juggling here to expose the icon or

94
00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:33.280
the words to the correct person.

95
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.009
Now, this trick of hiding the words,
I recommend only when the icon is

96
00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.150
really truly something that your target
audience is going to understand.

97
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.170
This is a portfolio website.

98
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.260
People who are looking for employees know
what LinkedIn is and know the the icon.

99
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.526
They know what the GitHub icon But if you
are in a situation where, I don't know,

100
00:06:55.526 --> 00:07:00.328
you want to have some sort of icon show
up for the about portion of the page,

101
00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:04.170
that you're going to need to
include some words with it.

102
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:12.644
So think through whether people will
actually understand what that icon means.

103
00:07:12.644 --> 00:07:19.235
So the way we'll set this up is
as follows inside of our icon,

104
00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:24.170
we're going to say aria
hidden equals true.

105
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.130
So this is going to hide the icon
itself from screen readers.

106
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.300
Okay?

107
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.845
So that's the first part of this.

108
00:07:35.077 --> 00:07:41.077
And then the second part of this is
the with the word LinkedIn itself and

109
00:07:41.077 --> 00:07:44.940
I'm going to put a screen
Span around this and

110
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.514
I'm going to add a class
of SSR hyphen only

111
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:57.770
The word LinkedIn and
then slash span So what is this?

112
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:04.230
This is an SSR hyphen only anytime you
see that, and you'll see it in Bootstrap.

113
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.490
You'll see it in Tailwind,
you'll see it in all kinds of places,

114
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.850
all kinds of frameworks.

115
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.460
It means screen reader only.

116
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.224
So this is a CSS style that comes
from the bootstraps, or sorry,

117
00:08:15.224 --> 00:08:18.050
from the Font Awesome style sheet.

118
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.810
And it will take that word and
set it in such a way that screen readers

119
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.400
are able to read it if they are reading
your webpage but people who

120
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.470
are looking at your page visually
will not see that word and in fact.

121
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.810
That is what's going on here.

122
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:37.605
You can see the LinkedIn icon, but you
don't see the LinkedIn words anymore, but

123
00:08:37.605 --> 00:08:39.410
yet it's still accessible.

124
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.799
So these are the changes that you need
to make if you're gonna work with

125
00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.900
Font Awesome and
you're gonna work with its icon set.

126
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.950
These two changes.

127
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:52.580
The Aria Hidden True on the icon and then
make sure the words are either there for

128
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.868
everyone depending on the kind of icon
that you're using or add that class

129
00:08:57.868 --> 00:09:02.754
of SR only if the words need to be
hidden from all but screen readers.

130
00:09:02.754 --> 00:09:06.101
Those particular classes come from
Font Awesome and the way that,

131
00:09:06.101 --> 00:09:07.485
It thinks about the world.

132
00:09:07.485 --> 00:09:12.585
So just any page of icons that
you happen to be looking at here.

133
00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:18.495
I'm gonna look at this chameleon,
it has an FAB, start to add an FA.

134
00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:22.865
This link here has FAS starts with FAS.

135
00:09:22.865 --> 00:09:29.053
It has to do with some sort of styling
here inside of Font Awesome but

136
00:09:29.053 --> 00:09:36.364
all of these icons will start with FAS,
FAB FA whatever they all start with FA.

137
00:09:36.364 --> 00:09:41.017
Fortunately there's a very cool
selector that we can use that

138
00:09:41.017 --> 00:09:44.260
will say if it starts with FA...

139
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.616
If it contains FA as
part of the class name,

140
00:09:47.616 --> 00:09:51.080
we can apply certain
kinds of styling to it.

141
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.520
Let's apply that now because we need
to make this a little bit bigger.

142
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.150
It looks kind of tiny right
there inside of this nav bar.

143
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.587
Here inside of my Nav bar what
I'm going to do is add to this.

144
00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:14.463
A nav with a class and
this is in square brackets,

145
00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:21.960
I'm gonna say class star equals,
quote, FA, hyphen.

146
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:28.067
And, We're

147
00:10:28.067 --> 00:10:34.440
going to say the font size Is 150% and

148
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.240
the color is var aqua, all right?

149
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.161
So, font size not hard to understand,

150
00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:48.680
150% means make it 150% bigger
than the base font size.

151
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.492
Color, probably you got that good.

152
00:10:51.492 --> 00:10:53.477
What about the selector?

153
00:10:53.477 --> 00:10:56.502
So this selector is called
the attribute selector.

154
00:10:56.502 --> 00:10:58.900
So rather than looking for

155
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:04.568
the HTML element UL nav A all
the rest of them this is looking for

156
00:11:04.568 --> 00:11:08.725
One of the attributes
inside of the HTML tag.

157
00:11:08.725 --> 00:11:14.096
So here we've got we have a class,
that's our attribute and

158
00:11:14.096 --> 00:11:20.710
we have FA B we have FA hyphen LinkedIn,
right FA hyphen LinkedIn.

159
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:25.570
So I'm targeting this starting
FA hyphen portion of this class.

160
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.670
So we're looking for
