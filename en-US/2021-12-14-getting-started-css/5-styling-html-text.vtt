1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.395
So we have our font family in place.

2
00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:07.492
Let's also put in our background
color background hyphen color.

3
00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:12.178
And once again we can just draw that from
our variables that are up here at the top

4
00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:12.967
of the page.

5
00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:17.912
And we want a kind of a black background,
right?

6
00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:21.210
So we all just say var black.

7
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.079
So that'll make the black background
kinda hard to read our text now.

8
00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.090
So let's set our color.

9
00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:35.948
To white.

10
00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:42.159
And by the way, that black and
that white aren't pure 000 black or

11
00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.455
FFF white,
those are slightly less than that.

12
00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:50.942
And that's all appeared
declared in our variables.

13
00:00:50.942 --> 00:00:53.831
And then we can also set our font size.

14
00:00:55.926 --> 00:01:04.360
Var, font size Because I like
the text a little bit bigger.

15
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.970
The next thing I wanna do, I want to
think a little bit about these headings.

16
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.456
One of the things that happens
as you start to work with all of

17
00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:14.567
this text that's here on the page.

18
00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:19.286
Is that sometimes you want to modify
the distance between some of these lines.

19
00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:23.624
And by default your headings
have margin assigned to them.

20
00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:26.933
And in fact, the margin assigned to
all of the headings is the same.

21
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:27.970
It's 1 m, e m.

22
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.545
Which is a relative unit of
measure 1m on an h1 is much

23
00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:37.519
bigger than 1m on a paragraph.

24
00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:39.581
Because it's a sliding scale.

25
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:41.547
It's very relative to what's going on.

26
00:01:41.547 --> 00:01:44.103
It's the width of a letter m.

27
00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:47.680
So, obviously that's bigger
when the h1 is bigger.

28
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.014
It's smaller when
the paragraph type is smaller.

29
00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:56.739
So one of the things that a lot of people
like to do is to turn off some of these

30
00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:58.275
settings like margin.

31
00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:00.373
And then we can adapt
them a little bit later.

32
00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:05.870
So that is what I'm going to do here.

33
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:13.196
I'm going to say, for my h1, h2 and h3.

34
00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:18.714
Let's set these up to have a margin of 0.

35
00:02:18.714 --> 00:02:23.140
And we'll see some of that
starts to close together.

36
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.341
But, hi, my name is Jen Kramer, didn't
smash right on top of I teach the web.

37
00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:31.340
Why is that?

38
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.281
Does anyone have any idea why the margin
if I turn off the margin on that h2.

39
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:41.524
Why didn't those two lines of text
smash on top of each other immediately?

40
00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:43.429
So anyone have any idea?

41
00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.233
Okay, so I'll tell you,
though weird trick.

42
00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.822
They are block elements
that's absolutely true, but

43
00:02:48.822 --> 00:02:52.550
that doesn't explain why they didn't
line up on top of each other.

44
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.765
This is the weird thing about margin and
CSS that throws a lot of people.

45
00:02:56.765 --> 00:02:59.256
If I have two elements coming together and

46
00:02:59.256 --> 00:03:02.682
I have padding no margin let's
talk about just padding.

47
00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:07.014
I have one REM of padding here I have one
REM of padding here they come together.

48
00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:09.691
What is the distance
between those two elements?

49
00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:13.786
Two REM, right?

50
00:03:13.786 --> 00:03:15.682
1 plus 1 is 2.

51
00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:17.872
In margin land though it's
completely different.

52
00:03:17.872 --> 00:03:22.405
If I have 1 REM of margin and 1 REM of
margin and they come together in CSS,

53
00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:24.764
how far apart are those two elements?

54
00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:30.568
One REM one plus one
equals one in margin land.

55
00:03:30.568 --> 00:03:35.983
I know it's really weird but margins
collapse when they encounter each other.

56
00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:37.464
And if they are different values.

57
00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:39.885
So if I have two rems of margin and

58
00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:43.492
one REM of margin coming
together the two wins.

59
00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:47.907
So we'll wind up with a space
of two rems in between.

60
00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:53.138
Wat's happening here is my paragraph
has one m of margin on it my

61
00:03:53.138 --> 00:03:58.286
h two had one m of margin on it
now it's been turned into a zero.

62
00:03:58.286 --> 00:04:01.570
So I still have a space in
between those two lines.

63
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.757
That space is coming from my paragraph.

64
00:04:04.757 --> 00:04:08.293
Okay, that space is
coming from my paragraph.

65
00:04:08.293 --> 00:04:10.490
So if you're wondering why that's there.

66
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.031
That's the reason why this is margins
only in a vertical direction.

67
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:18.710
Horizontally margins add just as
you would expect that they would.

68
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:23.610
Padding in a vertical direction,
adds exactly as you expect it would.

69
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.327
But margin in a vertical direction
has this weird exception to the rule,

70
00:04:28.327 --> 00:04:29.421
they collapse.

71
00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:33.904
Let's also set up our link styling.

72
00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:35.162
Let's start with an A.

73
00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:43.592
And we can assign a color to that,

74
00:04:43.592 --> 00:04:49.312
in this case I'm gonna use a var magenta,

75
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.808
Yeah, there's that nice hot color for
the link.

76
00:04:56.808 --> 00:05:00.103
And right now we just have our link color.

77
00:05:00.103 --> 00:05:01.546
But we don't have a hover state.

78
00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:04.138
So maybe we wanna hover state.

79
00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:08.691
And so to add that,
we'll just add an a:hover after that.

80
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.841
And I'm gonna change that color
to a hot mag, a hot magenta.

81
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.792
It's subtle but it changes color just
a tiny little bit when you hover over it.

82
00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:31.370
And text decoration of none.

83
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.635
So about these links I just
wanted to mention real quick.

84
00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:41.390
Here's the rules on underlines if you want
to make an accessible web page, okay?

85
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.162
If you have text that's inside of a
paragraph the way this particular link is,

86
00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:47.691
okay?

87
00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:51.469
You want to have an underline
displayed by default.

88
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:57.770
Or some other methodology other than
color that indicates that this is a link.

89
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.360
And the underlined is
a great way to do that.

90
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.260
Because everyone recognizes that
underlined text on the web is a link.

91
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.074
You can turn off that underline on hover.

92
00:06:07.074 --> 00:06:11.140
But when you have your
links in on your web page.

93
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.758
And they are set up this way,
in other words, no underline by default.

94
00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:19.282
You have to actually roll your mouse over
it, maybe the underline appears then.

95
00:06:19.282 --> 00:06:23.312
Remember that 10% of
the population is colorblind.

96
00:06:23.312 --> 00:06:29.295
And you are now calling out your
links specifically only by color.

97
00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:33.580
You wanna be sure that there is
a second way of identifying that link.

98
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.749
That's one of the core
accessibility principles.

99
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:42.740
So I recommend that for links again inside
of text you always have an underline.

100
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.297
When we go to the navbar the position
in space suggests that this is

101
00:06:46.297 --> 00:06:47.339
a navigation bar.

102
00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:49.952
Plus we'll have markup that
indicates that it's such.

103
00:06:49.952 --> 00:06:52.743
There it is fine to turn off
the underlines on your links.

104
00:06:52.743 --> 00:06:57.031
But inside of your text you really
wanna leave your links underlined.

105
00:06:57.031 --> 00:07:00.305
So that's just sort of some generic
styles here that are gonna carry us

106
00:07:00.305 --> 00:07:02.190
through the rest of our page.

107
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.334
Why do I say they're generic?

108
00:07:03.334 --> 00:07:07.283
Because so far,
we've only use sort of HTML elements.

109
00:07:07.283 --> 00:07:10.042
Okay, in terms of calling out our CSS,

110
00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:13.730
we have not actually applied
any specific classes.

111
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.095
We haven't applied any IDs.

112
00:07:15.095 --> 00:07:17.797
We haven't done any
exceptions to the rule.

113
00:07:17.797 --> 00:07:20.361
So generally speaking,
when you build your CSS.

114
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:22.991
Build some big generic
things outside of it and

115
00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:25.361
then create your exceptions to the rule.

116
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:26.942
You're gonna wind up with and

117
00:07:26.942 --> 00:07:30.240
more maintainable page it's
gonna be much easier to manage.
