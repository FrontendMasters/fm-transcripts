WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.315
So for the rest of this then, Let's

2
00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:10.084
say that these are our intro styles, so
these are going to be styles specific

3
00:00:10.084 --> 00:00:13.226
to this intro section of text for
the rest of this.

4
00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:19.703
And I'm gonna start with
generically on my intro itself,

5
00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:25.929
maybe we'll put some padding
on the bottom of 10 rem.

6
00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.369
You won't actually see
anything happen here but

7
00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.655
it will show up when we start to
assemble this into a full web page.

8
00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:36.643
This will give us some nice space in
between the end of this introduction and

9
00:00:36.643 --> 00:00:39.739
before we go into the next
section of the page.

10
00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.497
We're gonna also add some other styles.

11
00:00:42.497 --> 00:00:46.926
So again, for
the paragraphs here inside of our intro,

12
00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:51.743
we may want the font size to
actually be just a touch smaller.

13
00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:55.714
We set it to 1.3 rem on
the body of the document, but

14
00:00:55.714 --> 00:01:00.941
here we want it to be slightly smaller,
so I'm gonna say it's 1 rem.

15
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:06.101
That will make all of that
text just a tiny little

16
00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:11.009
bit smaller, and our line height is 1.5.

17
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.507
Okay, now, some of you may look that and
go, 1.5 what?

18
00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:19.445
So this is one of the big mistakes that
a lot of people make with line height, and

19
00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.742
that is that they add some sort of
unit of measure along with this.

20
00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:25.297
When you add a unit of
measure to line height,

21
00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:28.809
you've now set line height to
be an absolute unit of measure.

22
00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:33.626
So if I said for example 1.5 rem,
you won't see any necessarily any

23
00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:37.627
visual distinction here with
my particular website, but

24
00:01:37.627 --> 00:01:43.350
if I blew the text up a little bit more,
that line height would be unchanging.

25
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.351
When you take the unit of measure off
of line height, it's now a proportion.

26
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:54.460
So what I've said here is 1.5 times
whatever my font size happens to be.

27
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.218
So if I blow my text up in the browser,
again, an accessibility to type

28
00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:02.295
of thing because I need to have a larger
font size to be able to read this page,

29
00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:05.130
then the line height will
blow up proportionately.

30
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.172
If you don't do that, you'll end up with
a text that overlaps on top of itself,

31
00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:13.560
when you blow up your fonts
inside of the web browser,

32
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.180
maybe you've seen that in action before,
okay?

33
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.502
So when working with line height,
remember it's a proportion and

34
00:02:20.502 --> 00:02:22.118
leave off the units of measure.

35
00:02:22.118 --> 00:02:26.478
Okay, so let's focus on the name
portion of this now up here on the top.

36
00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:31.354
And once again, if we take a look
at what we're trying to build here,

37
00:02:31.354 --> 00:02:36.314
hi, my name is, is clearly not that
Oxygen Sans Serif font that we've

38
00:02:36.314 --> 00:02:39.448
been working with, so let's change that.

39
00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:44.358
And to do that, I need to select
this particular paragraph here.

40
00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:47.684
And I could do that with
something like first child, or

41
00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:49.647
I could just add a class to this.

42
00:02:49.647 --> 00:02:52.692
So I am gonna add a class
to this called name and

43
00:02:52.692 --> 00:02:55.748
I'm gonna put that on
the paragraph itself.

44
00:02:55.748 --> 00:03:03.092
So here in my HTML on line 3, my
paragraph is now p with a class of name.

45
00:03:03.092 --> 00:03:06.745
And then down here in my CSS,

46
00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:13.292
I can say intro .name,
and change my font family,

47
00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:18.328
so font-family: var (--mono).

48
00:03:21.148 --> 00:03:27.464
So there's that, hi, my name is, but
of course, Jen Kramer is not quite right.

49
00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:32.077
All right, now I need to target
just the name portion of this,

50
00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:34.405
that span tag that I have here.

51
00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:36.382
So let's write a class for that as well.

52
00:03:38.864 --> 00:03:44.110
So this will be name space span,
I don't need to create another class for

53
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.125
this, span is a perfectly good HTML tag.

54
00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:51.221
Normally, it has a class associated
with it, but because I put the class on

55
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:54.731
the paragraph, and I only have
one span element inside of this,

56
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:57.180
I could write a style just like this.

57
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.088
If you feel more comfortable
adding a class to the span tag,

58
00:04:00.088 --> 00:04:01.201
you could do that too.

59
00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:06.277
All right, so here we'll say font-family,

60
00:04:06.277 --> 00:04:12.665
we'll have to reset it again,
var(--sans), okay?

61
00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:18.945
And then we need a font size for
rem, right?

62
00:04:18.945 --> 00:04:21.890
Make it nice and big.

63
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.515
And then we want the color, Aqua.

64
00:04:31.364 --> 00:04:34.844
Now here comes the fun part,
how do we get it on its own line?

65
00:04:34.844 --> 00:04:36.639
Do we have any suggestions?

66
00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.392
How would I get this font its own line?

67
00:04:39.392 --> 00:04:42.603
What is span by default?

68
00:04:42.603 --> 00:04:45.775
Is it block or is it in line?

69
00:04:45.775 --> 00:04:46.570
&gt;&gt; In line.

70
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.403
&gt;&gt; In line, right?

71
00:04:48.403 --> 00:04:53.786
So if something is in line, it is in line,
it is part of that whole paragraph.

72
00:04:53.786 --> 00:04:56.398
If we wanted it on its own line,
it should be what?

73
00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:01.705
Probably a block, yeah.

74
00:05:01.705 --> 00:05:07.776
So to this, we can simply say,
display : block.

75
00:05:07.776 --> 00:05:10.086
There, now it's on its own line.

76
00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:16.733
And finally,
the last thing that I wanna do is this,

77
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:20.822
intro h2 font-size: 4rem.

78
00:05:20.822 --> 00:05:25.345
There we go, I teach the web,
nice and big, but of course,

79
00:05:25.345 --> 00:05:31.046
you could always mess around with that
if you wanted to say something like,

80
00:05:31.046 --> 00:05:33.055
font-weight: normal.

81
00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:37.525
Since this is coming from a Google Font,
it tends to display the weight that we had

82
00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:42.486
for the Google Font, which I think we use
the 400 weight or 300 weight Oxygen font.

83
00:05:42.486 --> 00:05:44.814
So it looks the way it looks.

84
00:05:44.814 --> 00:05:48.703
I think that went down just a tiny
little bit in terms of boldness but

85
00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:52.876
you can mess around with the font weight
to make it look the way you want.

86
00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:57.958
So there we go, we have constructed
our first part of this webpage.

87
00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.461
What we did was we took just
that little bit of text,

88
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:03.506
we dropped it into a code pen.

89
00:06:03.506 --> 00:06:09.243
And then we worried about styling that
all by itself in its own little universe,

90
00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:13.364
and we wound up with this
particular look to the web page.

91
00:06:13.364 --> 00:06:16.602
Not too awful, right?

92
00:06:16.602 --> 00:06:19.890
A nice way to look at this and break
the problem down into smaller pieces.
