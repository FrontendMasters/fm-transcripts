00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.158
Okay, so
let's move on to make our color bars, and

2
00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:07.430
that is going to start with a gradient.

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.389
So here in our instructions, so

4
00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.070
we are still in Chapter 4.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.430
We are down now on Part 3, which is
called adding lines in between sections.

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.040
So how do we get this cool gradient?

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.000
They look like borders, don't they?

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.062
So my first approach to this was
to try using the border property,

9
00:00:33.062 --> 00:00:37.030
but you need to have
a gradient associated with it.

10
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.156
So the regular old border property
will let you assign a color to it.

11
00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:44.040
So I can make a one
pixel solid red border.

12
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.906
That's straightforward enough to do.

13
00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:51.794
But to implement a gradient, you can
use a property called border-image.

14
00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:54.639
And that will allow you
to plug in a gradient.

15
00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:59.086
Unfortunately, it works great in Firefox,
it works great in Chrome.

16
00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:03.235
But in Safari it will not put
it on one side of your element,

17
00:01:03.235 --> 00:01:05.534
it will put it on all four sides.

18
00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:06.823
So in other words,

19
00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:11.587
you'll wind up with a box of gradient
as opposed to a line of gradient.

20
00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:15.500
So the way I wound up having to
solve this was to use a div,

21
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.102
create my gradient, and
set that as the background for that div.

22
00:01:20.102 --> 00:01:24.707
And then give it a very small height so
that it looks like a line.

23
00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:29.630
That was the solution that I came up with
that wound up working across browsers.

24
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.430
So the first step in that process
is to generate the gradient.

25
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.367
And there are lots of websites you
can go to to generate a CSS gradient,

26
00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.972
but I've chosen cssgradient.io.

27
00:01:40.972 --> 00:01:44.710
If you have another site you like,
feel free to use it.

28
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.150
And here what we're going to
do is generate a gradient.

29
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.330
And I've given you the two colors
that this particular gradient uses.

30
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.110
You're welcome to choose other colors,
if you like.

31
00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.070
So I think this one is
the pinkish magenta color.

32
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.181
So let's just plug that in,
copy, paste there.

33
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.137
And then we have another color here.

34
00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:18.572
This is the aqua color,
copy and paste it there.

35
00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:21.448
Okay, so
the way this particular website works,

36
00:02:21.448 --> 00:02:25.979
it's gonna show you what the gradient
looks like up here at the top of the page.

37
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.030
So right now what we have
going on is a radial gradient.

38
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.000
So it's actually more of a circle.

39
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.881
Your mileage may vary, by the way.

40
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:38.638
I use this site a lot, and
I was creating a radial gradient for

41
00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:40.863
something else a little while ago.

42
00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:43.710
I'm gonna switch it back over to linear.

43
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.670
Linear is gonna treat it,
obviously, more like a line.

44
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.195
And we have two color stops here.

45
00:02:50.195 --> 00:02:56.405
We have one at 35, so, in other words make
it solid magenta until we get to the 35,

46
00:02:56.405 --> 00:03:01.433
which is just sort of a number on
a scale of 1 to 100 or 0 to 100.

47
00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:04.873
Then between 35 and 68,
we're gonna make the gradient happen,

48
00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:06.840
go from one color to the other.

49
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.789
And then 68 and higher,
we're gonna make it all the aqua color.

50
00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.830
I actually don't want that.

51
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.135
So we can just slide these points all
the way out to the end, 0 and 100.

52
00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:20.469
And then the last part
of this is the angle.

53
00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:27.959
So down here in the interface,
it says 353 degrees, which is great.

54
00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.129
What I actually want,
though, is 90 degrees.

55
00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.304
The reason I want it at 90 degrees is
because I have a very narrow height and

56
00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:40.259
I want to have my color bar go
from pink to aqua on the page.

57
00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.344
And I want the whole
gradient to be visible.

58
00:03:42.344 --> 00:03:45.800
If I do a very small height and
I have a funky line going on,

59
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.340
who knows how much of the gradient is
actually gonna show up inside of that?

60
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.880
All right, so once you have set this up,

61
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.310
this will give you the CSS
down here at the bottom.

62
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.720
So it's giving you two lines of CSS.

63
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.460
One line is just a solid color.

64
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.736
That's a fallback for

65
00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:09.020
older browsers that may not be
able to implement a CSS gradient.

66
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.656
My understanding is that most browsers are
pretty good at CSS gradients at this point

67
00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:14.460
in time.

68
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.400
So I am just gonna copy this
second line of code here.

69
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.470
And that is the code for the gradient that
we just created there in the interface.

70
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.250
Okay, so we'll copy that line of code.

71
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.792
And we will go over
here to our styles.css.

72
00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:35.278
And I'm gonna scroll back
on up in my style sheet,

73
00:04:35.278 --> 00:04:38.277
back where it says background color divs.

74
00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:41.460
It's probably a good place to
put it to keep things organized.

75
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.603
And I am going to create
a class called gradient.

76
00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.640
Cuz like I said,
I'm super creative that way.

77
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.873
I'm gonna give the gradient that thing
that I just copied from the color gradient

78
00:04:54.873 --> 00:04:55.440
website.

79
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.190
And I'm gonna assign out
a height of 2 pixels, okay?

80
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.120
So a div with a class of gradient is
gonna have a height of 2 pixels and

81
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.683
it will have that gradient
associated with it.

82
00:05:09.683 --> 00:05:14.145
And then all I have to do,
after I save my CSS,

83
00:05:14.145 --> 00:05:18.520
is drop in those divs into my document.

84
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.650
So where are those color
gradient lines gonna go?

85
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.419
They are going to go after the navigation,
after the intro.

86
00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.386
So here, between the intro and
the contact, we'll add a div here.

87
00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:41.300
Class=gradient /div, okay?

88
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.380
Why div?

89
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.870
Because we want a block level element that
will stretch all the way across the page.

90
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.970
And div is meaningless.

91
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.810
There's no semantic value
associated with a div.

92
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.861
It's gonna go in here.

93
00:05:56.861 --> 00:06:00.601
Its whole purpose in life
is to hold that class and

94
00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:04.718
to be 2 pixels size so
it'll look cool, that's it.

95
00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:07.256
All right, so, I'm gonna copy that.

96
00:06:07.256 --> 00:06:10.281
And before I go crazy and
put all of them in,

97
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.485
let's just take a quick
peek at our webpage.

98
00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:17.144
So make sure your CSS and
your HTML are saved.

99
00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:22.068
And refresh your web page, and you should
have a cool gradient line showing up

100
00:06:22.068 --> 00:06:25.719
here now in between your introduction and
your contact.

101
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:29.156
All right, so let's add the last one and

102
00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:34.123
that's gonna go in between
your contact and your footer.

103
00:06:34.123 --> 00:06:40.352
So we'll drop in another div with
a class of gradient right there.

104
00:06:40.352 --> 00:06:43.060
And I think that's all of
the ones we have at the moment.

105
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.630
So either side of the contact, basically.

106
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.548
I mean,
this webpage is almost done, right?

107
00:06:47.548 --> 00:06:49.349
All that's left is the hard part.

108
00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:50.104
You're doing great.
