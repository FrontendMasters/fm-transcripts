1
00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:04.705
This is the moment where we're going
to move all of the stuff on our

2
00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:07.275
website from CodePen into VSCode.

3
00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:11.652
And I'm actually going to let
you take the first pass at this.

4
00:00:11.652 --> 00:00:16.114
And I'll walk through setting
up the file structure with you.

5
00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:19.480
And then I'm gonna let you do
this part copy over the code on

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.608
your own to get the practice of moving
from one environment to another.

7
00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:28.542
So what we're going to do first is we're
gonna set up a file structure on your

8
00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:33.260
desktop, and I'll walk you through
how to do that here in just a moment.

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.319
And what we're going to do
is go through your CodePens.

10
00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:40.741
So we have one for the intro that
we put together, we have one for

11
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:45.594
the footer, and we have one for
the navbar, and one for the contact.

12
00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:49.383
So that's four of the five sections on
that homepage we've actually already

13
00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:49.974
finished.

14
00:00:49.974 --> 00:00:54.510
So you'll go back and
investigate those CodePens and

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.363
copy in their code into the VS code and
then we'll debug.

16
00:00:59.363 --> 00:01:03.411
So let's start here with
setting up our file structure.

17
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:07.908
So what we're going to do is
right here on your desktop,

18
00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:13.171
we're gonna make a new folder,
and I'm gonna call this folder,

19
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:17.696
the portfolio Folder.

20
00:01:19.456 --> 00:01:21.194
So that will give us a start here.

21
00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:24.650
I like to put it on the desktop
because then it's really easy to find,

22
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.570
if you wanna put it somewhere
else in your file structure on

23
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.318
your computer that's just fine.

24
00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:32.216
It's just easier to find
on the desktop sometimes.

25
00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:36.687
And then I'm going to
open up my VSCode here.

26
00:01:36.687 --> 00:01:39.940
And again,
you can use any text editor that you want,

27
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.712
I am using VSCode there's a link for
it back in chapter one under prerequisites

28
00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:49.140
if you would like to download this and
install this on your own computer.

29
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.963
And now I'm just gonna simply
grab that portfolio folder and

30
00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:58.510
drag it and drop it inside of VS Code.

31
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.884
And I'm gonna say don't save.

32
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.701
For the question that it asks,
and then you should see that,

33
00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:14.833
so you may see a welcome panel
over here on the side, and

34
00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:21.660
over here on the left hand side you
see absolutely nothing, all is well.

35
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.390
Inside of that portfolio folder
that has absolutely nothing in it

36
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.231
we're gonna create two more folders.

37
00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:34.289
So, however you do that in your
environment, go ahead and do that.

38
00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:39.884
I'm going to create a folder called Image,
I-M-G for image,

39
00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:45.077
and I'm gonna create a folder called CSS,
just like that.

40
00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:48.717
And once I create them here,
they will also show up in VS Code.

41
00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:52.954
Those of you who know VS Code, yes you
can also create your folders there.

42
00:02:52.954 --> 00:02:56.344
So once you've got that in place
you have your portfolio folder.

43
00:02:56.344 --> 00:02:59.342
Inside of that is a CSS
folder with nothing in it,

44
00:02:59.342 --> 00:03:01.547
an image folder with nothing in it.

45
00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:07.215
Let's start our HTML file and a CSS
file so that you have those ready to go.

46
00:03:07.215 --> 00:03:10.339
So right here in this Welcome tab,
you can click on New File,

47
00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:11.698
that's what we wanna do.

48
00:03:11.698 --> 00:03:14.875
And it will ask you to select
a language to get started.

49
00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:17.117
So let's do the HTML first.

50
00:03:17.117 --> 00:03:23.567
If you scroll on down to HTML here, there
we go, that will start you in HTML file.

51
00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:28.508
The advantage here is that now we
can type an exclamation point,

52
00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:32.362
one single exclamation point,
and then hit Tab.

53
00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:38.166
So you have to make sure that when you
start your New File it's the type of HTML.

54
00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:43.697
Then you're gonna type an exclamation
point just one and hit Tab, not return but

55
00:03:43.697 --> 00:03:48.840
Tab and it will fill in all of this
information here for you automatically.

56
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.146
That is a functionality called Emmet,
that drives all of that,

57
00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:57.065
it's a really great little
shortcut to getting started.

58
00:03:57.065 --> 00:04:02.085
I'm gonna change the title of
my document to Jen Kramer's

59
00:04:02.085 --> 00:04:06.593
portfolio website or
whatever else you want to do for

60
00:04:06.593 --> 00:04:12.341
the title of your document, and
then we can just save it File Save.

61
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:17.814
It will ask us what we wanna call it,
we wanna call it index.HTML.

62
00:04:17.814 --> 00:04:19.892
Why index?

63
00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:24.696
Because index.HTML is one of those
default file names that if you

64
00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:29.409
were to put this up on a server somewhere,
it would be recognized

65
00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.410
generally speaking by that server
as the homepage for the website.

66
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.005
You call it index or you call it default
and there's a couple of other names.

67
00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:40.572
So, we'll say Save.

68
00:04:43.373 --> 00:04:45.813
So that's in place.

69
00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:51.419
Now what I'm going to do, I'm gonna go
back to that welcome Tab or you can go to

70
00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.138
New File, is the other way to get there,
and I'm gonna make a CSS stylesheet.

71
00:04:57.138 --> 00:05:00.244
So we'll select a language and

72
00:05:00.244 --> 00:05:05.507
I'm gonna select CSS from list and
we can save this.

73
00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:11.538
That's gonna go inside
of the CSS folder and

74
00:05:11.538 --> 00:05:17.212
let's call it style.CSS because
we're really creative that way.

75
00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:21.973
Okay?

76
00:05:21.973 --> 00:05:26.251
Back in our HTML now we need to
link those two things together.

77
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:29.487
So we have our HTML document,
we have our CSS document, but

78
00:05:29.487 --> 00:05:33.847
they're not talking to each other yet,
so let's make them talk to each other.

79
00:05:33.847 --> 00:05:37.857
In the head of your document, it can go
anywhere in the head of your document.

80
00:05:37.857 --> 00:05:42.914
I usually put mine towards the end
of the head of the document,

81
00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:44.865
often after the title.

82
00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:49.662
We'll add to this link href equals quote,

83
00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:55.923
we're gonna go to CSS,
we're gonna go to style.CSS,

84
00:05:55.923 --> 00:06:00.338
and we'll add rel equals stylesheet.

85
00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.845
So that's gonna link our stylesheet
document to our HTML document.

86
00:06:08.845 --> 00:06:10.992
Super important to get started.

87
00:06:10.992 --> 00:06:15.535
So I'm gonna have you do pretty
much the second part here.

88
00:06:15.535 --> 00:06:17.704
So what you're going to
do now is the following.

89
00:06:17.704 --> 00:06:22.962
For the very last CodePen that we worked
on working on the Footer grab that CSS and

90
00:06:22.962 --> 00:06:26.966
we're just gonna copy and
paste that into the stylesheet and

91
00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:29.653
you're done with your CSS that's all.

92
00:06:29.653 --> 00:06:33.885
Then what you're going to do
is in the HTML file you're

93
00:06:33.885 --> 00:06:37.105
gonna need to make links to Google Fonts.

94
00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:41.033
Remember that's oxygen and oxygen mono
that we've been working with unless you

95
00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.816
have other font choices that
you've been working with.

96
00:06:43.816 --> 00:06:49.849
You're gonna have to generate that whole
bit of HTML that Google will give you,

97
00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:53.000
drop that into the head of your document,

98
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.436
you'll need to do the same for
the Font Awesome font pack.

99
00:06:57.436 --> 00:07:01.721
And then go through each one
of the individual CodePens,

100
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:06.911
as I mentioned navigation, the intro,
the contact and the footer.

101
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:12.825
Get that HTML, copy and
paste that into the HTML document,

102
00:07:12.825 --> 00:07:18.974
clean it all up, make sure it flows well,
format your HTML and

103
00:07:18.974 --> 00:07:23.377
so forth, and
it is not going to be perfect.

104
00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:25.797
We're gonna have to walk
through those issues but

105
00:07:25.797 --> 00:07:28.284
that's as far as I would like for
you to get for now.

106
00:07:28.284 --> 00:07:32.428
Have fun, moving from CodePen into
VS Code, and then we're gonna debug and

107
00:07:32.428 --> 00:07:33.675
clean everything up.

108
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:45.615
So, if you had ran into
problems along the way or

109
00:07:45.615 --> 00:07:50.412
anything else you could take a look
at my files they're on GitHub,

110
00:07:50.412 --> 00:07:54.537
and inside of that you'll see
where chapter four begin.

111
00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:59.530
Those are the files after you
did those first threeish steps.

112
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:04.175
So if you got hung up or confused along
the way that you can download that

113
00:08:04.175 --> 00:08:08.211
folder and continue to move
forward here with the workshop.

114
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:11.365
Let's just take a peek at those now.

115
00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:14.280
So we'll start here with the HTML.

116
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.410
And over here we've got Google fonts and
you looked up oxygen mono,

117
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.820
and you looked up oxygen, and
you loaded up those styles,

118
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.140
Google gives you this bit of
HTML down here at the bottom,

119
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.115
this goes in the head of your document.

120
00:08:31.115 --> 00:08:37.343
So that is, That's what's going on here,

121
00:08:37.343 --> 00:08:42.175
we've got our links to our various Google
thoughts up here on the top of the page.

122
00:08:42.175 --> 00:08:47.561
As for font awesome,
what I wound up doing to just sort

123
00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:53.197
of make things simple,
any CodePen here under the CSS.

124
00:08:53.197 --> 00:08:57.858
If you took a look here,
there was a link that was given to you

125
00:08:57.858 --> 00:09:01.321
here inside of the CodePen
to Font Awesome.

126
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:04.871
And so
what I did was I copied that link and

127
00:09:04.871 --> 00:09:08.745
I put that in just a regular old link,
href.

128
00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:14.345
There's that link from from CodePen, Rel
equals stylesheet, so that would give you

129
00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:19.739
the Font Awesome styles, and then after
all of that is the link to our stylesheet.

130
00:09:19.739 --> 00:09:24.727
And as I mentioned before that style
sheet is just simply to take the styles

131
00:09:24.727 --> 00:09:29.473
that you had to that point in time for
the footer Copy all of those styles

132
00:09:29.473 --> 00:09:33.102
because the footer was
the last CodePen we worked on.

133
00:09:33.102 --> 00:09:37.114
We've been accumulating styles
through all of those exercises, so

134
00:09:37.114 --> 00:09:41.483
everything is here, we just copied and
pasted that into this style sheet.

135
00:09:41.483 --> 00:09:43.373
Now in terms of the HTML,

136
00:09:43.373 --> 00:09:48.597
we had to give a little bit of thought
as to what order we put things in.

137
00:09:48.597 --> 00:09:52.271
So, we have of course,
the body tag starts it all off.

138
00:09:52.271 --> 00:09:57.214
Then we follow that up with here's all
of the navigation bar that we had put

139
00:09:57.214 --> 00:10:02.157
together, there's that chunk of code,
that's followed by the chunk of

140
00:10:02.157 --> 00:10:06.007
code from the intro copied and
pasted in that HTML there.

141
00:10:06.007 --> 00:10:09.778
Then we have a chunk of code here for
the contact, so

142
00:10:09.778 --> 00:10:14.364
we grabbed that from that CodePen and
pasted that into place.

143
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:19.386
And then finally down here at
the bottom we have the footer okay,

144
00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:22.734
so hopefully that worked out okay for you.

145
00:10:22.734 --> 00:10:27.346
And, when we put this into a web browser.

146
00:10:29.601 --> 00:10:31.557
It looks something like this.

147
00:10:31.557 --> 00:10:34.498
Did you all get something similar?

148
00:10:34.498 --> 00:10:37.413
In other words, not necessarily
the prettiest thing in the world,

149
00:10:37.413 --> 00:10:39.675
and there's definitely
some issues going on here.
