00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.541
I'm going to go to this next part here
creating a call to action button and

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:05.180
making this responsive.

3
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.225
Donald Miller, who works for
a his own company, is called StoryBrand,

4
00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:12.226
he wrote a book called
Building A Better StoryBrand.

5
00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:15.661
He has some really great pointers for
great content and

6
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.738
convincing people who visit your website
to do whatever it is you want them to do,

7
00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:25.833
to buy something, to register for your
newsletter, whatever it happens to be.

8
00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:30.040
A big call to action in the navbar is
one of the things that he recommends.

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.350
And here inside of this navbar
what is the big call to action?

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.690
What do we really want someone
visiting this website to do?

11
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.750
We probably want them to take
a look at your resume, right?

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.250
Because ultimately a portfolio
is about getting hired.

13
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.396
So we would like to highlight that
resume button in some way and

14
00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:50.000
bring attention to it.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.510
And one way to do that is
to turn it into a button.

16
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.910
Now there are HTML button elements and
there are link elements.

17
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.120
That's the a tag,
what's the difference between the two?

18
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.350
The actual HTML button element has
to do with executing something.

19
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.934
So in other words, it has JavaScript
functionality generally associated

20
00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:16.250
with it, or it is what you click
on when you submit a form.

21
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.518
So it's not about a link,
a link has to be when I click this thing,

22
00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:24.400
I go to another page,
whether that's a page on my website or

23
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.710
it's a page on another website, or
even somewhere else on the same page.

24
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.096
That is the whole purpose of a link,

25
00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:36.076
a button is all about executing something,
submit a form or

26
00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:40.710
open a modal window or whatever else
you might be doing with buttons.

27
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.740
There's a lot of things you can do.

28
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.750
So the markup that we have this
resume button is in fact correct,

29
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.670
we don't want to change that
to a HTML button element.

30
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.070
What we need to style our link such that
it actually looks like a button, okay.

31
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.770
So that is what we're
going to try to do next.

32
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.685
And the best way to do this, I think,

33
00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:10.656
you can certainly mess around with
all kinds of funky CSS selectors, but

34
00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:14.650
what I'm going to do is I'm
simply going to make a class and

35
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.460
I'm going to put it inside of that Ref,
an element itself.

36
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.670
I'm going to call it a class and
I'm real creative.

37
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.530
I'm going to call it button,
class of button.

38
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.430
Okay, so let's add that to our HTML and
then we can style that.

39
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.872
So here in my CSS,
I'm going to call a class of, Button.

40
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:43.230
And then we can start configuring things.

41
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.860
So as you know from our web page, that is
a hot magenta or it's a magenta button.

42
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.880
It's got that hot magenta
color when we hover over.

43
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.733
It's got some rounded colors it is the
mono sort of font there's no underlying

44
00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:02.010
all of those things are really
important to that particular button.

45
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.690
So let's go ahead and
style that up accordingly then so

46
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.481
it has a background hyphen
color of var what, magenta.

47
00:03:13.677 --> 00:03:18.960
So there's that background
color right off the bat, right?

48
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.157
But that looks a little bit tight, so we
probably wanna add some padding to that.

49
00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:28.787
So padding 0.5 rem, okay so
that gives you a little bit

50
00:03:28.787 --> 00:03:33.320
of space between the text and
the edges of your button and

51
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.163
then all we need to do is round
the corners, border radius.

52
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:48.800
Five pixels and so that of course
is subject to your designer eye.

53
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.133
If you think that the corner
should be more rounded or

54
00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:53.944
if you think that there should
be more padding or less padding,

55
00:03:53.944 --> 00:03:56.720
you can of course make all of
those adjustments accordingly.

56
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.600
But this is what looked good to me,
so that's good.

57
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.050
That looks pretty good right there,
well, we got a bit of a problem.

58
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.110
When we roll our mouse over that button,
the text disappears.

59
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.150
That's because by default, our links
are styled to be the color of this button.

60
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.350
So we're gonna need to do
something about that, right?

61
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.910
So let's write that style
dot button cowen hover.

62
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.577
We want the color to be white or
var white.

63
00:04:29.473 --> 00:04:33.357
So when we roll our mouse over,
we keep our text and

64
00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:36.790
we're gonna change our background color.

65
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.086
To var, dot mag,

66
00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:48.880
there we go.

67
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.782
So, now we have a really big
call to action right there,

68
00:04:52.782 --> 00:04:56.152
on the button draws your attention very,
clearly right to that button so,

69
00:04:56.152 --> 00:04:57.881
you can see what's happening there.
