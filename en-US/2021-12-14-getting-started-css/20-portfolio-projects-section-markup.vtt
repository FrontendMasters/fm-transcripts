1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.292
We are ready to do the hard
part of this portfolio, so

2
00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:07.461
this is now going to be the actual
portfolio section of the homepage.

3
00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:11.408
And why do I say it's the hard part,
it's actually not all that hard, but

4
00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:12.947
it does look intimidating.

5
00:00:12.947 --> 00:00:15.979
We have some crazy design
stuff going on here,

6
00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:20.735
where we've got text overlapping
images and all kinds of other things.

7
00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:25.216
But as you have seen already to this
point in the course, the methodology for

8
00:00:25.216 --> 00:00:28.240
working through these
problems remains the same.

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.552
We are gonna start with
semantic meaningful markup,

10
00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:35.682
then we're gonna work on styling
little bits and pieces at a time.

11
00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:39.558
And eventually we're going to
get to that overlap problem,

12
00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:43.898
it's easier than you think here in
the projects next Chapter Five.

13
00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:46.984
This is how this is going
to look on desktop and

14
00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:49.270
how this is gonna look on mobile.

15
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.547
So remember the phrase mobile first,

16
00:00:51.547 --> 00:00:55.472
mobile first means that this is
the default styling for the page.

17
00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:59.171
In other words, no media queries
involved in that particular layout.

18
00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:03.873
And then we'll also have the desktop
dimension which will be inside of

19
00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:08.416
media queries that will override
that default mobile styling which

20
00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:10.820
occurs outside the media queries.

21
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.734
So, that will be something that we'll
be looking into as part of this

22
00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:17.354
particular project.

23
00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:22.884
So we're gonna start here then basically
building this portion of the page first,

24
00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:24.230
see how this looks.

25
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.820
We have our text up on top, we have our
image underneath and that's where we're

26
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.470
going to start building that first mark it
up, and then apply all the pretty styling.

27
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.576
And then we'll make it look like this was
the very last part of the whole thing, all

28
00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:44.625
right, so, the first place that we start
then again is with that semantic HTML.

29
00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:49.591
And I've given you of course, your
starting code pen here, things that you

30
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:54.489
want to think about as you start working
through this particular problem.

31
00:01:54.489 --> 00:02:00.330
So, I've given you the image and
I've given you the text that's here.

32
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.874
What is the most important part about
this series of, portfolio projects,

33
00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:09.427
so we have a title for this whole section
called projects that I'm proud of.

34
00:02:09.427 --> 00:02:13.518
Then we're gonna have a series of
the individual projects, what is

35
00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:17.825
the most important part of information
here was that sort of headline,

36
00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:19.643
part of that latest project?

37
00:02:19.643 --> 00:02:23.114
Is that latest project is it wall of
wonder, is it the project description,

38
00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:24.975
you're gonna have to think about that?

39
00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:28.039
And line your headings elements
in the appropriate way.

40
00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:33.026
You're gonna need to identify what it's
a paragraph, maybe you have a list of

41
00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:37.501
things here like the technologies
that you were used to include them.

42
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:41.517
And then I've given you the image
as a freebie there at the end.

43
00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:45.083
In code pen you have to have the Pro
version, which is the paid version,

44
00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:46.342
in order to host images.

45
00:02:46.342 --> 00:02:51.341
So I've done that part for you and
given you that image tag there at the end.

46
00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:55.808
Take a look at this particular
problem in terms of just the HTML,

47
00:02:55.808 --> 00:03:01.038
do not worry about how it looks,
don't try to group any of these elements.

48
00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:03.042
Just mark this up appropriately and

49
00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:06.728
I will tell you the way that I marked
it up for our project section.

50
00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:17.082
All right, so we are back again,
let's take a look at

51
00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:21.142
how you did with marking up the HTML for
our project section.

52
00:03:21.142 --> 00:03:23.336
This is really important, as always,

53
00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:28.126
we start with a semantic HTML what is the
meaning that you're trying to communicate?

54
00:03:28.126 --> 00:03:31.492
And then we can always throw
in all of the dives and

55
00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:33.888
all the spans that you want later.

56
00:03:33.888 --> 00:03:37.690
As needed that's what we've been doing the
whole way through this is no exception.

57
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.237
So let's start here with our HTML,
so here's the way that I did it.

58
00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:49.840
All right, so first of all, as we have
been doing the whole way through,

59
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.616
we started with a section
element because this is yet

60
00:03:52.616 --> 00:03:54.530
another section of that homepage.

61
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.529
So section and then the idea of
projects we put in that link in our nav

62
00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:03.831
bar to projects and so
we need something to connect it to.

63
00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:08.000
So that idea projects is important,
you can call it anything you want.

64
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.135
But whatever the ID is here in the section
needs to match the H ref attribute for

65
00:04:13.135 --> 00:04:16.060
the project's link in your navigation, so

66
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.103
we'll skip down to the page
there to the appropriate point.

67
00:04:20.103 --> 00:04:23.078
Then I have a native H2 for
the whole section,

68
00:04:23.078 --> 00:04:27.515
projects I'm proud of that is the H2 for
that whole entire section.

69
00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:33.844
Then after that I've sort of grouped
everything together here in an article and

70
00:04:33.844 --> 00:04:39.590
that is because this is sort of its
own little self included story.

71
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.631
This is something that we could syndicate
that you would be able to get meaning

72
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:46.252
from, just by looking at
what happens to be here.

73
00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:50.590
So that's why I chose the article
element for doing this and

74
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.972
then inside of this,
we already have an H2 for

75
00:04:53.972 --> 00:04:58.082
the entire section with H1
is your name and the navbar.

76
00:04:58.082 --> 00:05:01.070
H2 for the whole section
is projects I'm proud of.

77
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.602
So we're on to H3 as our next element
remember you can make these any size

78
00:05:05.602 --> 00:05:10.209
you want, but you need to make sure
that these headings are not skipped and

79
00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:12.542
that they are go one after the other.

80
00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:17.245
So the important part here in this
article is wall of wonder that is

81
00:05:17.245 --> 00:05:19.051
the name of the project.

82
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:22.688
The latest project even though
it comes first, is descriptive,

83
00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:26.797
it's not necessarily the most important
thing that's here on the page.

84
00:05:26.797 --> 00:05:28.938
So I've set that to be an H4,

85
00:05:28.938 --> 00:05:34.614
then we have a paragraph that has the
description of that particular project.

86
00:05:34.614 --> 00:05:38.422
And the technologies used
include a mark that up as an H4,

87
00:05:38.422 --> 00:05:42.541
it's part of the article, but
if the article title is the h3,

88
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:46.770
then the h4 becomes sort of
the next level information.

89
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.061
So the technologies that we used include,
in this case, HTML, CSS, and SVG,

90
00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:52.867
that's a list of technologies.

91
00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:56.203
So that's an unordered list and
then at the very end,

92
00:05:56.203 --> 00:06:01.110
we have our image which is still part of
our article, and then we end our section
