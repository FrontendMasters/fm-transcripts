00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.276
All right, so
let's wrap up chapter number five.

2
00:00:03.276 --> 00:00:05.150
This is the last piece of this.

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.580
Here's what I would like for you to do.

4
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.250
This is the additional projects
portion of the course.

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.240
So what we've got here
is a series of projects.

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.520
And you'll see that there's
that first project.

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.590
We've already got that coded.

8
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.483
We've got the projects I'm proud of,
that's all coded.

9
00:00:22.483 --> 00:00:24.400
But now we've got two more.

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.710
And so one of these looks very similar.

11
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.840
That's the Wall of Wonder collection.

12
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.120
But then we have this Feed-A-Star-Mole
game that is a reverse layout.

13
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.659
So instead of having
the image on the left and

14
00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.304
the text on the right,
we reverse those two.

15
00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:44.610
So that is your next challenge.

16
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.510
And I have given you
your beginning CodePen.

17
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.630
I'm giving you answers for
all of the images on the left,

18
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.200
all of the text on the right.

19
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.480
If it feels like too much for
you to try to make one go the other way,

20
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.590
there's an answer for that.

21
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.700
That would probably be the best
approach to start with.

22
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.918
And then if you have time,
see if you can make that middle one and

23
00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:07.795
just the middle one do the reverse layout.

24
00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:10.558
And then we'll come back and
I will give you my answer.

25
00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:24.250
Let's take a look at the same side layout
CodePen here and see what happened.

26
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.130
So I gave you all of the text and the
pictures and everything that you needed.

27
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.831
So the big challenge here in making
the same side-by-side layout like

28
00:01:35.831 --> 00:01:42.630
this was very simply just making sure the
HTML is the same for all of the projects.

29
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.450
So what you hopefully did was you went
through each one of these projects,

30
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.665
turned it into an article,
gave it that div with a class of text.

31
00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:55.893
Marked up each one of these projects
the same way with the h3s and

32
00:01:55.893 --> 00:02:00.529
the h4s and the paragraphs with
the class of blackbox, and so forth.

33
00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:04.799
And so in theory, it should all
then look exactly like this because

34
00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.165
we established the pattern
with the first project.

35
00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:12.657
And the other two projects then,
if they're marked up the same way,

36
00:02:12.657 --> 00:02:15.767
they should wind up looking the same way,
too.

37
00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:20.310
You shouldn't have to adjust any CSS for
those succeeding projects.

38
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.535
And, of course, if you wanted to make
your screen a little bit smaller,

39
00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:28.370
you should see how nicely everything
stacks on top of each other.

40
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.488
Okay, so
that's the same side part of that.

41
00:02:32.488 --> 00:02:39.226
Once you have that working, so the markup
is correct and it's on the same side,

42
00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:44.670
then the next question is how do
we get that alternating layout?

43
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.195
And so the way that you would
go about doing that is this.

44
00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:52.133
So in the HTML for that second project, I
set up an article with a class of reverse,

45
00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:56.100
because that's what it is, it's reversing.

46
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.040
And then we just set up some
exceptions with that reverse class.

47
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.430
So in our CSS, what we'll do
inside the media query, so here,

48
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.940
for projects reverse,
I just read a few styles to reverse this.

49
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.361
So instead of projects or
just the regular old text,

50
00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:20.261
here I've said projects reverse text,
has a different configuration for

51
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:25.480
our grid column, a different configuration
for the order, and so forth.

52
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.632
So some of those numbers change.

53
00:03:27.632 --> 00:03:32.313
And instead of saying flex-end for
our list that we have here at the end,

54
00:03:32.313 --> 00:03:36.210
we go back and
tell it to do a flex-start again.

55
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.685
So it's really just these three classes
here that you would need in order to

56
00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:41.620
reverse this.

57
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.739
We're just gonna change what columns and
the ordering of the image and

58
00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.740
the text to make these things
then overlap each other.

59
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.010
So that's all there is to that and making
all of the rest of this go in place.
