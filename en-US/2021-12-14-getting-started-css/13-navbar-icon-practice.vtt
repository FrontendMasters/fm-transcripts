00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.439
I would like you to first of all,
take the GitHub link that we have here,

2
00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.360
swap that out for the GitHub icon,
make it accessible.

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.326
And then the second thing I'd like for
you to do is I'd like for

4
00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:17.190
you to find some kind of icon that
might be suitable to go with your name.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.955
So in my case in my website here,
I picked the HTML icon here,

6
00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:29.480
but there are many other choices
1608 choices for an icon.

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.540
So I'd like you to pick something
from the font is awesome

8
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.377
choices that might go with your name and
get that installed as well.

9
00:00:38.377 --> 00:00:42.757
That's gonna require a little bit of
styling trick there also to make it work

10
00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:47.274
with your name, so you might have to write
an extra class in order to add a little

11
00:00:47.274 --> 00:00:51.820
bit of styling to that, see how far you
get and then I'll tell you my answer.

12
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.574
Go ahead

13
00:00:58.623 --> 00:01:01.958
Hope you all did well with
that navbar exercise.

14
00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:08.132
Let's take a look at how
we might go through adding

15
00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:13.134
those particular icons to our web page.

16
00:01:13.134 --> 00:01:18.496
So here's what I've got going on in my
particular let's start here with the HTML,

17
00:01:18.496 --> 00:01:22.479
so here with GitHub pretty much
looks exactly like LinkedIn,

18
00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.099
except it has a different code,
of course for the icon.

19
00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:29.206
So here we've got the GitHub square,

20
00:01:29.206 --> 00:01:33.973
Aria hidden true,
screen reader only is the GitHub icon.

21
00:01:33.973 --> 00:01:38.109
And it should have taken the same
styling that the LinkedIn icon did.

22
00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.308
So you should be pretty well set up here.

23
00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:47.704
And then up here at the top of the page,
as I said before I chose this particular

24
00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:52.685
icon to represent me, I hope you chose
whatever represents you well and

25
00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:55.355
was available there on font awesome.

26
00:01:55.355 --> 00:02:00.310
So I hid that particular icon, right,
so aria-hidden true, I don't I need

27
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.512
that icon to be visible to screen readers,
but I wanted my name to show next to it.

28
00:02:05.512 --> 00:02:09.853
So the way I set that up was with
two different span elements.

29
00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:15.266
One span contains that icon, the other
span is going to contain my name.

30
00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:20.099
So those two things will just sit
next to each other very nicely.

31
00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.795
And in the reason when I added
that span element is down here

32
00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:31.257
in my CSS one of the things
that I added here in my nav h1,

33
00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:35.929
I didn't want that icon to be so
big by default.

34
00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:40.150
So here for nav h1 with the class of fa.

35
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.110
So notice that that comes
after the initial nav class

36
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.838
fa attributes selector declaration.

37
00:02:48.838 --> 00:02:53.199
I reset my font size to
a hundred percent and

38
00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:59.873
I set my color to aqua and
to get these two be magenta on mouse over.

39
00:02:59.873 --> 00:03:00.427
Okay.

40
00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:06.450
So by default they were not
magenta on mouse over and

41
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.773
the reason why is because
the class up here nav

42
00:03:11.773 --> 00:03:17.674
class fa is more specific
than simply nav a hover.

43
00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:24.029
If you look at the CSS specificity part of
this that does not work so you'll need to

44
00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:30.390
add an additional class here in order to
get that to work on hover for those icons.
