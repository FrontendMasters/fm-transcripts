00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.547
Okay, so now that you have
your project in place here,

2
00:00:03.547 --> 00:00:07.970
you've got your VS code page that we
finished at the end of chapter 4.

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.473
That's the one that has the death bar, the
introductory text, the contact text, and

4
00:00:12.473 --> 00:00:13.680
the footer.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.964
What I'd like for you to do now is to take
the work that you've done on the projects,

6
00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:22.230
I would like you to slot it
on into that VS code page.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.301
You probably need to add a gradient
bar in there somewhere, so

8
00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:30.480
you might need to think about where that's
gonna go and how you're gonna fit that in.

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.640
And of course, copy over
the relevant parts of the styles.

10
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.829
And then you should wind up with
a webpage that is the complete homepage,

11
00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.110
should be completely done by
the time you're done with that.

12
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.341
So as my instructions tell you to do,
go to your CodePen we just finished,

13
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:52.141
copy the CSS from that
CodePen we just finished,

14
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:55.658
replace all the CSS that you
have in your document right now.

15
00:00:55.658 --> 00:01:00.870
Just copy and paste that right and
over, erase what's already there.

16
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.086
And then you're gonna wanna take that
project HTML, copy that over, and

17
00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:08.010
plug it in the right location,
and then evaluate.

18
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.362
So what's wonky?

19
00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:10.360
What's missing?

20
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.580
What do you need to tweak?

21
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.442
As I mentioned, the gradient bars,

22
00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:17.691
you may need to think about a little
bit of other styling tweaks.

23
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:22.220
And then I'll come back and
I'll tell you my answer to the problem.

24
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.581
So go ahead and give that a try.

25
00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:35.396
All right, so hopefully that was a little
easier than what you did the last time

26
00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:39.693
around, when we had to pull in all
of those different code patterns.

27
00:01:39.693 --> 00:01:42.429
This time we only had one to work with,
and hopefully,

28
00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.226
that went pretty smoothly for you.

29
00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:50.190
So if you take a look here in your HTML,
it probably looks something like mine.

30
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.471
So you can add those div
with a class of gradients,

31
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:56.059
you can add as many of those as you need.

32
00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:59.873
You need one at the top of the project,
so you need one at the bottom, so

33
00:01:59.873 --> 00:02:04.271
one in between the intro in the projects,
one between projects and the contact,

34
00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:07.134
those are two gradients
that you should have added.

35
00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:13.100
But the rest of the HTML should be pretty
straightforward, copy paste kinda thing.

36
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.027
And then, of course,
I copied over my CSS from that CodePen.

37
00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:22.405
And when I took a look at the web page,
I saw something like this.

38
00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:25.530
And so why navbar my intro was good, but

39
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.184
my projects are stretching all
the way across the screen.

40
00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:33.198
So we forgot to do something with that,
and

41
00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:37.320
then there's those gradient
bars that I dropped in here.

42
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.676
So how do we going to narrow this up and

43
00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:44.320
get this in line with everything
else that's here on the page?

44
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.140
All we need to do is take a look at what
we've done before, and what we've done

45
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.050
before is we set a max width of 1200
pixels, and we centered it on the page.

46
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.813
So here in our CSS,
what we ought to do then is add,

47
00:02:54.813 --> 00:02:55.666
we're gonna add a style here for
the projects itself.

48
00:02:55.666 --> 00:03:00.508
We'll set the max width of

49
00:03:00.508 --> 00:03:04.690
1200 pixels, and

50
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.860
we'll set the margin to 0 auto.

51
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.573
And once we've done that,
we've saved our document,

52
00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:23.597
then when we go back to our web page,
it should, in theory,

53
00:03:23.597 --> 00:03:28.676
all line up and
look absolutely fabulous, okay?

54
00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:31.277
And if we make the page
a little bit narrower,

55
00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:34.302
we'll run into a couple
breakpoints along the way.

56
00:03:34.302 --> 00:03:38.613
I think, my navigation breaks before my
projects do, there's nothing wrong with

57
00:03:38.613 --> 00:03:46.702
that, that's just a thing And
make the screen a little narrower still,

58
00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:51.220
and then you'll see our projects all
stack very nicely on top of each other.

59
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:57.410
All right?

60
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.174
So congratulations, you built that
complicated seemingly difficult

61
00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:07.346
looking web page layout, by process of
breaking things into little pieces.

62
00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:11.825
So what I hope you take away
from this is as follows.

63
00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:14.662
So first of all,
take a look at the web page and

64
00:04:14.662 --> 00:04:18.338
identify what is probably
the easiest thing to code on it.

65
00:04:18.338 --> 00:04:22.696
In this case, we started with this little
bit of text right on up here at the top of

66
00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:25.520
the page, because it's just text.

67
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.485
So we started with that, we put it
into CodePen, we formatted it up,

68
00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:30.698
we got our quick win,
which always energizes you.

69
00:04:30.698 --> 00:04:34.952
If you start with a hard thing, then
it feels like everything else is hard,

70
00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:36.448
start with the quick win.

71
00:04:36.448 --> 00:04:39.634
So we formatted that tiny
little bit that felt really,

72
00:04:39.634 --> 00:04:44.080
really good, then we moved on to navbar,
that was the next thing to work on.

73
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.880
And from the navbar,
we learned about accessible icons,

74
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.730
we learned about how to format
something to look like a button.

75
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.925
That was then stuff we could carry into
the footer of the webpage, where we also

76
00:04:55.925 --> 00:05:01.055
had icons, and we could format those to
look like the way that you see it here.

77
00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:05.763
And then we were ready to add on the
contact section, which was also not that

78
00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:09.723
hard, and we had already styled
up the button in the navbar, so

79
00:05:09.723 --> 00:05:14.017
then we could drop that into
the contact section and add on, right?

80
00:05:14.017 --> 00:05:18.405
So, all along the way, we're sort of
doing things and progressive levels

81
00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:22.738
of difficulty and recycling the little
bits of code that we write as we go.

82
00:05:22.738 --> 00:05:27.638
Then the last part that we tackled was the
projects, because it looked complicated,

83
00:05:27.638 --> 00:05:31.140
and it was gonna take a little
bit extra time to work on.

84
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.649
So I hope that this approach,
and particularly,

85
00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:36.111
where we just sort of work
things out in CodePen.

86
00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:40.132
Where we could go really fast and
see what the immediate results were,

87
00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:44.439
we can go faster there, then we can
inside the vs code for this type of work.

88
00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:49.057
And then bring it all back together inside
a vs code to put the page together,

89
00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.004
do your final set of twerks, and

90
00:05:51.004 --> 00:05:54.420
you have a project that you
can really truly be proud of.
