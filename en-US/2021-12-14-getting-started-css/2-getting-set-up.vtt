1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.950
We are at chapter one.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.350
And this is the prerequisites
in getting set up.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.830
And this is definitely more oriented
towards you beginning beginners.

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.827
So as I said before,

5
00:00:09.827 --> 00:00:14.300
we're going to be building a portfolio
website about two pages in length.

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.149
And I will provide you all of the assets
that you see on that site already.

7
00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:20.054
So the about me picture and

8
00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:24.736
the pictures of the projects
that maybe you've actually done.

9
00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:28.738
But I would actually prefer it and I think
it'll be a more meaningful project to you

10
00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:31.350
if you swap this out with
all of your own information.

11
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.675
And so for those of you who are a little
bit more advanced and already know

12
00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:38.279
how to set up a coding environment, this
might be what you wanna work on while I

13
00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:41.296
address some of the beginning
beginners here for a few minutes.

14
00:00:41.296 --> 00:00:44.692
So what I would recommend
you do is the following.

15
00:00:44.692 --> 00:00:49.480
You can go to a website like Adobe Color,
and choose a color palette for your work.

16
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.132
So I am gonna be working in the color
palette you saw there on your screen, but

17
00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:56.650
let me just open up Adobe Color here.

18
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.690
If you've not been to this website before,
this is color.adobe.com/explore.

19
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.444
And you'll see here that on this page,
there are a few color palettes,

20
00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:09.660
they all look kind of remarkably similar.

21
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.304
Unfortunately, they don't
make this too obvious.

22
00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:13.779
So if you go over here to the views side,

23
00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:18.830
this little drop down here in the upper
right corner, go to color themes.

24
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.194
And then you can just go to
something like most popular, and so

25
00:01:22.194 --> 00:01:24.210
this is what's popular here today.

26
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.261
All kinds of different color themes
that are here and available for you, or

27
00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:32.070
you can filter them in a bunch
of other different ways.

28
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.732
And if you find one in here that you like,
you go wow, this one's really great,

29
00:01:35.732 --> 00:01:38.040
click on it,
it will put you into another screen.

30
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.587
It'll give you all of the hex codes
that you need in order to work with this

31
00:01:41.587 --> 00:01:43.290
particular color theme.

32
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.178
And of course, for
those of you who are graphic designers and

33
00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:48.555
a little bit more
knowledgeable in this context,

34
00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:52.060
you are welcome to of course
create your own color palette.

35
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.300
So that's the Adobe Color
functionality that's here.

36
00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:02.512
Second, think about two fonts that go
together that you want to use together.

37
00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:07.111
We're going to be using two fonts that
come from Google Fonts today that's Oxygen

38
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:09.080
and Oxygen Mono.

39
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.480
But, you are welcome to choose different
fonts, if you like different fonts.

40
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.348
And obviously, most of you're probably
familiar with the Google Fonts website,

41
00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:19.260
it's at fonts.google.com.

42
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.680
And today there are only 12,084 fonts to
choose from, I hope that's enough for you.

43
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.970
And you can choose two that
are going to go together.

44
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.817
If you have no idea how to choose two
fonts that go together, the website that I

45
00:02:33.817 --> 00:02:38.235
recommend for you is called font pair,
and that's at fontpair.co.

46
00:02:38.235 --> 00:02:44.123
And font pair has a whole
bunch of different fonts.

47
00:02:44.123 --> 00:02:46.030
You can just scroll through here, and

48
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.900
it'll give you some ideas of
two fonts that go together.

49
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.252
So if design is not really your thing,
just pick something from here that you go,

50
00:02:53.252 --> 00:02:55.030
wow, that looks kind of fun.

51
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.060
I think I might make use
of those particular fonts.

52
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.445
And I believe the fonts that are in use
here are also available on Google Fonts,

53
00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:04.488
but you'll want to double check that and
make sure that that's true.

54
00:03:08.747 --> 00:03:15.330
Get a photo of yourself, suitable for
a workplace type of website.

55
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.055
The usual types of recommendations
apply obviously, this is a work site so

56
00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:22.920
you want to have something that's
fairly professional looking.

57
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.830
Don't wear a hat, don't wear your
sunglasses, smile, look at the camera.

58
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.910
Those would be my biggest hints to you for
a picture for that particular page.

59
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.696
Three examples of your work would be
a great thing to include as well,

60
00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:41.283
you can get a screenshot for each of those
to fit the theme that I've given you here.

61
00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:45.880
And write up just a couple of sentences
about that particular project.

62
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.780
That would be a wonderful
thing to include and then you

63
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.111
could maybe link of someplace where you
might have some more detail about that.

64
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.632
The social media links are good things
to include I recommend LinkedIn and

65
00:03:56.632 --> 00:03:58.351
GitHub for a work related website.

66
00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:02.638
But if you are a big Twitter user or
other social media platform user and

67
00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:06.215
you want to include that
that's fine as well.

68
00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:11.261
And if you wish, a copy of your resume,
and you might have that in PDF format and

69
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:14.801
might be on a place like Dropbox or
Box or Google Drive.

70
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:18.875
Or maybe you actually have that someplace
else that's already marked up in HTML, and

71
00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:20.315
that would be fine too.

72
00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:23.590
All right, so the things that you should
know before you take this course.

73
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.647
So back a few years ago we put together
a boot camp here at Front End Masters,

74
00:04:28.647 --> 00:04:32.275
it was Brian Holt who did
the JavaScript part of that.

75
00:04:32.275 --> 00:04:36.938
And I covered HTML and CSS,
that is available online.

76
00:04:36.938 --> 00:04:41.079
So, we offered this course here
on our Internet fundamentals,

77
00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:45.770
Internet fundamentals.com/watch
will give you all of these videos.

78
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.310
They're totally free you don't
even need to register for them.

79
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.855
And they'll give you a little bit of
background about things like a very,

80
00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:54.360
very high level about
how the Internet works.

81
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.717
They'll talk about files and
folders, organizing files and

82
00:04:57.717 --> 00:05:00.320
folders on your Mac or on your PC.

83
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.189
A little bit of background about browsers
and those kinds of technologies,

84
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.616
and a little bit about CodePen and
moving information into CodePen.

85
00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:11.179
Moving it over to VS Code,

86
00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:14.790
which is the editor that we'll
be using to build web pages.

87
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.111
So, that is here it's
on the Internet again,

88
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:21.510
no registration required you can watch
these videos at any point in time.

89
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.382
The bootcamp itself, it requires
only an email address in order to

90
00:05:26.382 --> 00:05:30.500
watch the videos here for
this particular course.

91
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.360
And so you do not need a Frontend Masters
subscription to watch this.

92
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.476
And like I said, again, it's gonna walk
you through the basic basics of HTML and

93
00:05:39.476 --> 00:05:43.860
CSS, there's a website that goes
with that as well, that's here.

94
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.515
And so what I am recommending that
you complete before you start this

95
00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:53.627
particular course would be
simply there's an introduction.

96
00:05:53.627 --> 00:05:58.730
There's a setup and prerequisites HTML,
CSS and Layout, that's it.

97
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.245
Those first five chapters are what
you're gonna need to know in order to

98
00:06:02.245 --> 00:06:03.950
take this particular course.

99
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.280
I'll talk you through all the rest of it.

100
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.455
Finally, in terms of technology,

101
00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:14.950
you're going to need to have some kind of
editor for HTML and CSS to follow along.

102
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.480
Although we're not going to get there for
a little while.

103
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.462
The editor that I will use when we
get there is called VS code and

104
00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:24.800
it's available here,
I've given you the link.

105
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.332
If you want to download this tool and
follow along, this is it,

106
00:06:29.332 --> 00:06:33.450
and mine comes up as Mac
because I'm using a Mac.

107
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.422
But as you'll see here on the down arrow,
you also have choices for Windows and for

108
00:06:38.422 --> 00:06:42.260
Linux if those are the platforms
that you happen to be running.

109
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.326
Why VS code,
it tends to be an industry standard,

110
00:06:46.326 --> 00:06:51.350
it's relatively straightforward to set
up so that is here and available to you.

111
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.319
If you like something else
if you prefer brackets,

112
00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.918
if you prefer Sublime Text,
if you prefer Notepad plus plus.

113
00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:03.013
You are welcome to use any tool that you
want that will let you write HTML and CSS.

114
00:07:03.013 --> 00:07:07.620
And there are a lot of those because
again, we're keeping this simple, simple.

115
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.640
And then finally,

116
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.840
we're going to be using code pen as
one of our big technologies today.

117
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.930
And code pen is here at code pen.io,
I have already created an account.

118
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.414
But if you have not, you can do so.

119
00:07:21.414 --> 00:07:24.040
I will give you links to the CodePen.

120
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.914
So this is what code pen looks like,
it's got an HTML block here on the top,

121
00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:29.670
it's got a CSS block here.

122
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.123
There's also a JavaScript
block down here underneath but

123
00:07:33.123 --> 00:07:36.793
I generally use the JavaScript
block to give you directions.

124
00:07:36.793 --> 00:07:40.073
That's all one great big huge comment
because again we're not reading any

125
00:07:40.073 --> 00:07:41.820
JavaScript in this course.

126
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.583
Up here on the top under settings,

127
00:07:44.583 --> 00:07:50.217
you'll find places where you can
add to this specifically under CSS.

128
00:07:50.217 --> 00:07:53.800
Scroll down to the bottom,
we'll go through this again later as well.

129
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.172
You can add here external stylesheets or
pens,

130
00:07:56.172 --> 00:08:00.430
this is a great way to include the fonts
that you're gonna use on this web page.

131
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.604
So we'll make use of this when we add
our links to our Google Fonts into

132
00:08:03.604 --> 00:08:05.160
Font Awesome.

133
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.503
The other part of this is this funny
looking button here that I don't

134
00:08:09.503 --> 00:08:12.620
know it's kind of a bunch of boxes.

135
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.280
This is how you change
the orientation of your page.

136
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.291
And I believe when you start code pen,
it will look like this where you've got

137
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:24.040
the HTML and CSS and JavaScript on the top
of the page with the design underneath.

138
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.658
I find it more convenient to put my code
on the left hand side of the screen,

139
00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:33.292
because then I am able to grab this
middle bar and move this back and forth.

140
00:08:33.292 --> 00:08:35.970
Which is helpful for
working in responsive design.

141
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.816
So you can configure your screen the same
way, and then of course you'll need a web

142
00:08:39.816 --> 00:08:43.413
browser hopefully you have Firefox and
Chrome installed on your computer.

143
00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:48.577
Those are definitely preferred over
Safari or edge which depending may

144
00:08:48.577 --> 00:08:53.582
have different issues and
tend to be less cross browser compatible.

145
00:08:53.582 --> 00:08:57.393
Although this becomes less and less of
an issue with every month that goes by.
