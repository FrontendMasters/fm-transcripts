1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.820
Let's move on then to styling this,
and in our instructions,

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.550
we'll show you what this
is gonna look like.

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.884
So we're going to set up
a horizontal nav bar.

4
00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:14.546
We're going to start by creating
the navbar that we're gonna see on mobile

5
00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:16.184
devices, and on tablet.

6
00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:19.785
Now in a more professional
setting here and

7
00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:25.496
in fact in my advanced CSS layouts
course here at Front End masters.

8
00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:30.021
I have walked through how to set up
a hamburger button using only CSS.

9
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:34.796
And so, but that takes a lot of
extra time in order to set that up.

10
00:00:34.796 --> 00:00:37.842
So I've left that out in
this particular course,

11
00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:42.857
if you're interested there is you can go
watch that advanced CSS layouts course.

12
00:00:42.857 --> 00:00:47.557
I will cover the how to put in a hamburger
button with just CSS in detail for

13
00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:50.960
the purposes of this course and
to keep this simple.

14
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.826
We're going to use this particular
layout here, for both mobile and for

15
00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:57.119
tablet settings.

16
00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.785
So the first thing that
we need to do then is,

17
00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:03.402
we need to make our navbar go
horizontally across the page.

18
00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:07.132
And we need to put the name on top and
make it bigger, and

19
00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:10.394
we wanna put all of our
links there underneath.

20
00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:13.338
So that is the first goal that
we have with our styling,

21
00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:16.478
just to worry about the text and
to make that magic happen.

22
00:01:16.478 --> 00:01:19.907
So let's go through exactly how
we might go about doing that.

23
00:01:19.907 --> 00:01:24.708
So for our navbar,
we have lots of HTML elements

24
00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:28.919
that we can work with here in our styling.

25
00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:33.440
And so the first thing that I wanna do is,
set up my default font family and

26
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.278
I wanna set up a little bit of broad
padding for the entire navbar altogether.

27
00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:45.464
And so to do that, we can just simply use
the nav element itself as our selector.

28
00:01:45.464 --> 00:01:51.494
And we'll set our font-family, To Mono,

29
00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:55.430
because that's what we
wanted in our design here.

30
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.578
You see, we have Mono down here, okay?

31
00:01:56.578 --> 00:02:01.073
And then on the top,
our name is in the oxygen song saref.

32
00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:08.391
And then after that,
we can set our font size, and

33
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:11.882
just sort of throw you
a little bit of a curveball.

34
00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.675
I've set it to 80%.

35
00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:18.699
Now you may not have ever seen percent's
used in font sizing here before, but

36
00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:24.286
it works exactly as you would expect, take
the base font size and reduce it by 80%.

37
00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:28.089
So whatever that base font size
happens to be, whether it's the H1,

38
00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.257
which is really big.

39
00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:33.166
Or whether it's the list items
which are smaller, take it and

40
00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:36.712
multiply whatever that font
size value is by a percent.

41
00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:40.017
And it proportionately
shrinks everything down.

42
00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:42.851
So you see here that I didn't
have to go through and

43
00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:47.390
specify a whole bunch of different sizes,
everything scaled appropriately.

44
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.821
And then I'm going to add to this
some padding, 1 rem on all sides.

45
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:56.189
Now let's take a look at that H1, my name.

46
00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.873
I would actually like to have that,
as I said with the oxygen sans serif font.

47
00:03:00.873 --> 00:03:02.777
So let's set that up.

48
00:03:02.777 --> 00:03:10.227
How would we go about creating a style
that would target just Jen Kramer here?

49
00:03:10.227 --> 00:03:14.964
And there are many selectors that
can be used to make this happen, but

50
00:03:14.964 --> 00:03:19.547
this is a link inside of an h1
inside of a navigation environment.

51
00:03:19.547 --> 00:03:25.556
So remember that when you write CSS
selectors you're going to write them.

52
00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:27.451
Just like everything
else we write in English.

53
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:29.777
We write them from left to right.

54
00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:32.412
But we read them from right to left.

55
00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.570
Read your selectors from right to left.

56
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.205
So I'm trying to Carga Jen Kramer.

57
00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:41.433
I'm going to start with a,
that's gonna be my link.

58
00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:45.649
That's gonna be my furthest
right selector, followed by h1,

59
00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:50.501
that will be my middle selector and
then nav will be the one on the far left.

60
00:03:56.388 --> 00:03:57.833
Okay, so nav h1 a.

61
00:03:57.833 --> 00:04:03.116
Here I'm gonna have a font-family

62
00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:10.189
of var sans, Okay?

63
00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.738
So now I have my first link, my name.

64
00:04:11.738 --> 00:04:14.818
It has a sans serif font and

65
00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:19.720
all of the rest of them
have the Mono font.

66
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.874
All right,
now we can style the navbar as a whole.

67
00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:25.118
So nav ul.

68
00:04:25.118 --> 00:04:28.689
For every navbar you ever
write from forever forward,

69
00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.734
this is the kind of style that
you can copy over and over again.

70
00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:36.724
It's always gonna start
with these three things.

71
00:04:36.724 --> 00:04:42.526
We're gonna start with our list, style
type of none that turns off the bullets.

72
00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:47.113
But you'll notice that we're
still indented slightly,

73
00:04:47.113 --> 00:04:52.072
that is because the ul element and
the ol element have by default

74
00:04:52.072 --> 00:04:56.676
on them from your browser either
padding or margin [LAUGH].

75
00:04:56.676 --> 00:05:00.149
It depends on what browser you're
working with, sometimes it's margin,

76
00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:04.132
sometimes it's padding, but that's what's
responsible for indenting your list.

77
00:05:04.132 --> 00:05:08.554
So we'll 0 both of them because we don't
know which browser people will use.

78
00:05:08.554 --> 00:05:13.122
So we'll say padding:0, margin:0, and

79
00:05:13.122 --> 00:05:18.990
that will pull everything over
to the left side of the page.

80
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.113
Okay, so the next thing we'll
do is we'll go to Flexbox.

81
00:05:23.113 --> 00:05:26.348
The reason we're going
to use Flexbox here,

82
00:05:26.348 --> 00:05:29.765
is because we have one
long line of navigation.

83
00:05:29.765 --> 00:05:33.719
And we want to put this going
horizontally across the page, and

84
00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.909
we may ultimately wind up wanting
to reorder some of these things.

85
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.988
We definitely want to change
the layout over time.

86
00:05:40.988 --> 00:05:45.973
Fortunately, Flexbox can be really,
really simple in this kind of environment.

87
00:05:45.973 --> 00:05:48.824
There's only a handful of
properties you need to know.

88
00:05:48.824 --> 00:05:53.984
And in fact, for say 85, even 90%
of the work that you do in Flexbox,

89
00:05:53.984 --> 00:05:59.751
these are the properties are gonna be the
ones you use over and over and over again.

90
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:03.590
All of the other ones that they might have
covered in your boot camps or whatever,

91
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.477
those are all extras,
they're all exceptions to the rule.

92
00:06:06.477 --> 00:06:10.061
These are really the core
properties here inside of Flexbox.

93
00:06:10.061 --> 00:06:15.985
So to set this up,
we're gonna say display: flex.

94
00:06:15.985 --> 00:06:21.021
Now put everything together in a very
ugly sort of line on the page.

95
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:22.318
There we go.

96
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:29.611
I often say flex flow: row wrap: we do
want these navigational elements to wrap

97
00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:30.797
onto another line.

98
00:06:30.797 --> 00:06:38.172
We don't want them to all crammed together
as in a no wrap type of situation,

99
00:06:38.172 --> 00:06:42.913
we do want to have that
flexibility of wrapping.

100
00:06:42.913 --> 00:06:47.008
We can justify content of center: so

101
00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:52.563
this is going to center
us in space horizontally.

102
00:06:52.563 --> 00:06:57.442
So justify content is the main axis
of what you're working with inside

103
00:06:57.442 --> 00:06:58.359
of Flexbox.

104
00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:06.646
So here that is the row will
center everything within the row.

105
00:07:06.646 --> 00:07:12.310
And we can also say a line items:center.

106
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.219
This is the vertical axis in this
particular case because we're working

107
00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:21.735
with a row justify content that
pertains to the horizontal space.

108
00:07:21.735 --> 00:07:27.223
Align items in this particular case
is applying to the vertical space,

109
00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:29.149
which is the cross axis.

110
00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:33.477
And then so they're not in line,
but don't worry, we'll fix this.

111
00:07:33.477 --> 00:07:39.762
And then gap is a new property you might
have heard about or you might not have.

112
00:07:39.762 --> 00:07:44.653
So a really great invention inside
of Flexbox that just recently became

113
00:07:44.653 --> 00:07:49.638
available, it will assign you a space
in between all of these elements.

114
00:07:49.638 --> 00:07:53.371
So we're gonna set that up to be 2rem.

115
00:07:53.371 --> 00:07:54.953
So we have a nicely spaced navbar here.

116
00:07:54.953 --> 00:07:59.080
So we already have all the bones
of our navbar in place,

117
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.417
with just a few properties
here on the page.

118
00:08:02.417 --> 00:08:03.620
How are people doing so far?

119
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.717
Have any questions at this point?

120
00:08:06.717 --> 00:08:09.938
&gt;&gt; You put nav h1 as your selector,

121
00:08:09.938 --> 00:08:15.590
is it a good idea to skip the nav
ul li h1 and your selector?

122
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:20.786
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
why did we not say nav h1 ul li a?

123
00:08:20.786 --> 00:08:22.824
Yeah, you totally could do that.

124
00:08:22.824 --> 00:08:24.269
That would be absolutely fine.

125
00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:27.765
There's nothing wrong
with that whatsoever.

126
00:08:27.765 --> 00:08:33.443
That would be a more specific selector
than what I'd specified here as just nav,

127
00:08:33.443 --> 00:08:33.952
h1 a.

128
00:08:33.952 --> 00:08:37.785
My philosophy on this is always
to put in as little as possible.

129
00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:42.181
And the reason you wanna put in as little
as possible in your CSS selectors, is so

130
00:08:42.181 --> 00:08:45.346
that they're always available
to be overridden later.

131
00:08:45.346 --> 00:08:49.946
Also, fewer elements in your
selectors make them more readable.

132
00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.141
So here, in my mind this is saying,

133
00:08:52.141 --> 00:08:56.326
we're targeting the a portion of
this link it's inside of the h1.

134
00:08:56.326 --> 00:08:58.526
And we're gonna put it in the navbar and

135
00:08:58.526 --> 00:09:02.874
all of those things are important to
understanding what that selector does.

136
00:09:02.874 --> 00:09:07.978
You absolutely could add a ul,
li you wouldn't affect anything here

137
00:09:07.978 --> 00:09:12.739
on the page Mitt just makes your
selector longer, that's all.

138
00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:16.229
So yeah, that's one of those
things you could go either way,

139
00:09:16.229 --> 00:09:19.130
I guess it's sort of
a stylistic type of question.
