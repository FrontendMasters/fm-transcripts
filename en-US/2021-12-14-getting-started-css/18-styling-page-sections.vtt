1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.457
All right, so let's start at the top here.

2
00:00:03.457 --> 00:00:05.996
Navigation bar looks pretty good.

3
00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:11.072
It looks like we've got our
responsive elements there in place.

4
00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:14.158
And it's centering as the page gets wider,
right?

5
00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:18.845
Because on the navigation bar,
we set a max width of 1200 pixels and

6
00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:20.966
we told it to center on the page.

7
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:24.494
So that is exactly what
that nav bar is doing.

8
00:00:24.494 --> 00:00:28.095
Maybe we should follow suit
with our introduction here.

9
00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:31.133
So our introduction doesn't
have any gating on it.

10
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.696
If my screen was this big,

11
00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:37.040
that introduction would stretch
across the full screen real estate.

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.605
So maybe what we ought to do for
the introduction is we

13
00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:44.908
should add that max width to it,
that might be something to do.

14
00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:49.125
The other things that are missing,
down here in the contact me section,

15
00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.074
we had that as that purple color.

16
00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:53.162
And of course,
we're missing that here on the page.

17
00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:54.933
So we'll need to think about that.

18
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:58.387
And we're also missing some of the little

19
00:00:58.387 --> 00:01:02.444
gradient lines that go in
between in the design.

20
00:01:02.444 --> 00:01:07.034
Here in the design,
we need to reevaluate these spaces here,

21
00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:10.846
when we're missing these
lovely gradient lines.

22
00:01:10.846 --> 00:01:13.286
They're here we're gonna talk
through how to make those.

23
00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:17.301
The projects part of this of course,
is the last part that we'll work on and

24
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:19.938
we're gonna still need to
build that part of it.

25
00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:22.020
So we still have these gradient lines and

26
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.419
we have a button here we need to put in,
right?

27
00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:30.963
So that's pretty much our punch
list here as we think through this.

28
00:01:30.963 --> 00:01:33.996
Okay, so let's work on that
introduction here first.

29
00:01:33.996 --> 00:01:37.434
So what I'm going to do
here in my style sheet,

30
00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:41.772
is I'm going to scroll on down
to my introduction styles.

31
00:01:41.772 --> 00:01:44.390
So that's red down around line 57 or so,

32
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.314
somewhere around in there
in your style sheet.

33
00:01:47.314 --> 00:01:50.091
And I'm gonna add to this a little bit.

34
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:56.343
So I've got by right now
a padding bottom of 10rem.

35
00:01:56.343 --> 00:02:00.516
So that's giving me a gap between
the end of the introduction and

36
00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:04.463
the start of the next section
which is that contact section.

37
00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:05.657
I'm gonna change this
up a little bit here.

38
00:02:05.657 --> 00:02:11.428
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to set padding

39
00:02:11.428 --> 00:02:17.057
overall to 4rem, remember that's the top,

40
00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:20.824
1rem, 10rem, and 1rem.

41
00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:23.961
So remember, four numbers like that,

42
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:29.285
when you see it associated with
something like padding or margin,

43
00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:34.434
those four numbers being a top,
right, bottom, left, TRBL.

44
00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:37.283
Remember that and stay out of trouble.

45
00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:41.014
TRBL, trouble.

46
00:02:41.014 --> 00:02:43.340
So that's what those four numbers mean.

47
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.708
So you can think about it as
the hands of a clock, top, right,

48
00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:51.420
bottom, left,
if you're more of a visual person.

49
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.040
So think about the hands
of an analog clock.

50
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.111
So we've got some padding on the top,

51
00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:59.654
a bit on the top to separate
us from the nav bar.

52
00:02:59.654 --> 00:03:03.668
We'll put a little bit on the sides,
so that at smaller screen dimensions,

53
00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:06.065
we don't smash into
the sides of the window.

54
00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:12.033
And then we'll have a big space of
padding going down into our next section.

55
00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:18.682
Then after that, I'm going to
add a max width of 1200 pixels.

56
00:03:18.682 --> 00:03:21.610
And we can say margin, 0 auto.

57
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.821
So that'll center our
introduction on the screen.

58
00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:35.468
So if we come on down here now and
refresh the page, that looks so

59
00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:37.653
much better, doesn't it?

60
00:03:37.653 --> 00:03:42.435
Now we have a very clear left alignment
going on here from my nav bar all the way

61
00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:44.101
down to my introduction.

62
00:03:44.101 --> 00:03:46.310
So that was just one
little bit of a tweak.

63
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.485
We added a max width,
we centered it on the page,

64
00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:54.222
and we swapped up our padding a little
bit to make this nice and spacious.

65
00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:58.428
All right, next, let's take a look
at this contact section here.

66
00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:04.039
It has the wrong background color, and we
need to add a button for the email link.

67
00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.676
So let's do that next.

68
00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:13.312
So scroll down here to
the contact section of the page.

69
00:04:13.312 --> 00:04:20.373
And what I'm going to do here, I need to
make this a background color of plum.

70
00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:25.110
So one of the things you might think
of doing is here at the contact

71
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.045
portion of this page,
we would simply say, background-color.

72
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.235
And we'd say var--plum, right?

73
00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:41.433
Makes sense?

74
00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:46.611
So if you do that, and
then take a look at the webpage.

75
00:04:46.611 --> 00:04:50.622
Unfortunately that gives you a big purple
square in the middle of the screen.

76
00:04:50.622 --> 00:04:54.929
And you'd probably really prefer to have
the purple stretching all the way across.

77
00:04:54.929 --> 00:05:00.205
So if you know why this happens,
then you know how to fix the problem.

78
00:05:00.205 --> 00:05:02.394
So why did this happen?

79
00:05:02.394 --> 00:05:07.721
This happened because we have a width
set of 400 pixels on this and

80
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:13.241
our background color,
the purple is occupying those 400 pixels.

81
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:17.797
It's not programmed to stretch
all the way across the screen.

82
00:05:17.797 --> 00:05:22.173
So how do we get it then to stretch all
the way across the screen while preserving

83
00:05:22.173 --> 00:05:24.370
our 400 pixels wide?

84
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.942
We're gonna need to add a div, okay?

85
00:05:26.942 --> 00:05:29.896
So that's what happens there.

86
00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:35.019
So here inside of my HTML down
here in the contact section,

87
00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:40.995
rather than leaving it like this,
what I'm going to do is add a div.

88
00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:46.116
And I'm gonna give it
a class of section-plum.

89
00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:50.420
Because it's the plum background color for
the section.

90
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.462
I'm real creative that way.

91
00:05:52.462 --> 00:05:59.082
And then down here at the end of
that section, we'll say slash div.

92
00:05:59.082 --> 00:06:05.071
I don't know why VS code is formatting
this so oddly but it is, so there we go.

93
00:06:05.071 --> 00:06:10.289
So we'll have this div now outside
of where the width is set.

94
00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:17.440
The width is set here on the section with
the idea of contact of 400 pixels wide.

95
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.754
So now I've got another div on top
of it where I can give it that plum

96
00:06:20.754 --> 00:06:22.130
background color.

97
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.528
And there's no restrictions on the size of
the div with a class of Section plum, so

98
00:06:26.528 --> 00:06:29.486
the purple will stretch all
the way across the screen.

99
00:06:29.486 --> 00:06:33.228
So now all we have to do is
write that particular class.

100
00:06:33.228 --> 00:06:38.230
So over here on the side, I think I put
this up towards the top of the screen.

101
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:44.146
In case we wanted to use it on
another page somewhere else,

102
00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:48.390
we could just say background color divs.

103
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:55.385
If that's something you wanna add later.

104
00:06:55.385 --> 00:07:00.306
And we'll say section- plum has got

105
00:07:00.306 --> 00:07:05.396
that background color of var-plum.

106
00:07:07.314 --> 00:07:10.498
And then of course down here
in the contacts section,

107
00:07:10.498 --> 00:07:13.134
we can get rid of
the background color here.

108
00:07:13.134 --> 00:07:14.199
You don't need that anymore.

109
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.945
So if we save that and
we take a look at our webpage, refresh.

110
00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:25.393
Now we have the purple color stretching
all the way across the screen, but yet

111
00:07:25.393 --> 00:07:29.850
we've still maintained that tight width
that we want there in that contact.

112
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.739
And then the last part of that is what
do we do about that particular button?

113
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.516
Great question.

114
00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:42.477
Well, remember that we wrote a class in
here somewhere called button, didn't we?

115
00:07:42.477 --> 00:07:46.264
Right here, around line 158 we
have a class called button.

116
00:07:46.264 --> 00:07:48.934
So we can just take that class now and

117
00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:53.580
apply it to the link that we
have in the contact section.

118
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.280
So here we are in the contacts
section down here,

119
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.541
there's our href inside of that element.

120
00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:07.100
We'll put in our class of button and
save that.

121
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.412
Let's take a look at that webpage.

122
00:08:11.412 --> 00:08:15.025
So yeah, we sort of got a button here,
sort of.

123
00:08:15.025 --> 00:08:20.003
But it's the wrong font and
it has an underline on it, right?

124
00:08:20.003 --> 00:08:25.831
Why is it doing that when the same class
of button up here works just fine for

125
00:08:25.831 --> 00:08:26.867
our resume?

126
00:08:26.867 --> 00:08:30.562
Well, the answer is always
at the CSS somewhere, and

127
00:08:30.562 --> 00:08:34.602
when it doesn't work,
doesn't work the way you expect.

128
00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:38.811
It's almost always an issue of
inheritance or the cascade.

129
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:41.623
So what's happening here with our button,

130
00:08:41.623 --> 00:08:46.268
we never actually called out a font
family on the button itself, did we?

131
00:08:46.268 --> 00:08:49.818
And we never actually called
out no underline on the button.

132
00:08:49.818 --> 00:08:51.455
Those things are inherited.

133
00:08:51.455 --> 00:08:56.305
We actually called out that
mono font family back here on

134
00:08:56.305 --> 00:09:00.753
our nav class and
that got inherited by the button.

135
00:09:00.753 --> 00:09:06.015
And we called out our lack of
an underline here on nav a.

136
00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:10.671
And that got inherited
by the button as well.

137
00:09:10.671 --> 00:09:14.003
So what we should do now?

138
00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:19.617
Well, we could make yet
another class if we really wanted or

139
00:09:19.617 --> 00:09:22.776
we could just simply add to this.

140
00:09:22.776 --> 00:09:27.772
So we could say our font
family is var-mono, right?

141
00:09:27.772 --> 00:09:32.572
And we could say text-decoration none.

142
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:37.090
Now that will be repetitive for the button
that shows up in our navigation, but

143
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.458
it will be helpful for
the one that shows up in our contact.

144
00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:44.546
We don't have to set up another class,
so we're not hurting the navigation, but

145
00:09:44.546 --> 00:09:46.038
we're helping the contact.

146
00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:49.073
Overall I'd call it a win.

147
00:09:49.073 --> 00:09:54.262
Save that, and refresh the screen.

148
00:09:54.262 --> 00:09:57.390
And there's our email me button
looking the way we want it to look.

149
00:09:59.411 --> 00:10:04.170
So then the last part of this has to do
with the footer, and it looks like my

150
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:09.183
footer padding is not quite working here,
so let's add to my footer class.

151
00:10:09.183 --> 00:10:14.296
Let's add a padding of 4rem 0, so
that will put 4rem on the top and

152
00:10:14.296 --> 00:10:18.897
the bottom of the footer,
nothing on the left and the right.

153
00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:24.642
And if we save that and refresh
the webpage, that's so much better now.

154
00:10:24.642 --> 00:10:26.556
We have a little bit of
breathing room there.

155
00:10:26.556 --> 00:10:30.003
&gt;&gt; Why did we add the div
around the contact section?

156
00:10:30.003 --> 00:10:32.437
Can we make the width 100% instead?

157
00:10:32.437 --> 00:10:34.974
&gt;&gt; You could make the width 100% instead.

158
00:10:34.974 --> 00:10:38.740
So let's do what this
person is suggesting.

159
00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:45.180
So on the contact section, if we took out
our div with a class of section plum.

160
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:54.839
And over here and our CSS,
if I can find it.

161
00:10:57.746 --> 00:10:59.183
There we go.

162
00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:03.045
With the 400 pixels,
we'll just take that out, okay?

163
00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:08.128
So now what we're saying is this contact,
which has,

164
00:11:08.128 --> 00:11:14.222
we should add back in our color here,
background-color, var.

165
00:11:14.222 --> 00:11:17.561
So now we have the plum right
on the contact section.

166
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:19.503
It's gonna stretch all
the way across the page.

167
00:11:19.503 --> 00:11:23.034
We took out the width, so
this should work great, right?

168
00:11:23.034 --> 00:11:24.791
So let's save our HTML.

169
00:11:24.791 --> 00:11:26.763
Let's save our CSS.

170
00:11:26.763 --> 00:11:29.260
And let's refresh the webpage.

171
00:11:30.585 --> 00:11:31.739
And what happens.

172
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.069
So, this is what happens,
if my goal was to keep my text compressed

173
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:42.296
in that small window,
the way that I had it styled before,

174
00:11:42.296 --> 00:11:46.378
we have gotten rid of that
particular piece of styling.

175
00:11:46.378 --> 00:11:50.607
Now I could probably re-add in
this very specific instance.

176
00:11:50.607 --> 00:11:54.922
Re-add that width of 400 pixels
to the paragraph itself, but

177
00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:59.871
sometimes we wanna think about what's
gonna happen for the page overall.

178
00:11:59.871 --> 00:12:03.712
How many exceptions to the rules
do we really wanna make?

179
00:12:03.712 --> 00:12:08.863
And so the concept of a div with the class
of section plum meant that I could

180
00:12:08.863 --> 00:12:14.945
take that same background color, and as I
said, maybe potentially eventually apply

181
00:12:14.945 --> 00:12:20.799
it elsewhere in my document rather than
adapting things very specifically here.

182
00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:26.191
So you are not necessarily completely
incorrect, this is another solution.

183
00:12:26.191 --> 00:12:30.848
You'll have to also add that with the 400
pixels to that paragraph at least in

184
00:12:30.848 --> 00:12:32.805
order to bring back the styling.
