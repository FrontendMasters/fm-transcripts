00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.759
All right so now it's time for
you to give this a try all right.

2
00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.445
So now that you've gone through this
process and you've seen how this works,

3
00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.934
here's what I'd like for you to do next.

4
00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:15.069
I want you to try styling the contact
section of the webpage and so

5
00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.377
I'll show you on the real webpage.

6
00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:21.736
The contact section of the webpage
is this part right here, contact me.

7
00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:26.324
We're gonna make an exception to that
at this point in time, let's say,

8
00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:29.220
where don't worry about
the button just yet.

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.584
Just make it a plain old link.

10
00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:32.995
We'll go back and
get the button a little bit later.

11
00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:35.805
And so here's what you need to do.

12
00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:37.847
I'll give you the beginning code pan.

13
00:00:37.847 --> 00:00:41.697
I'd like you to style up that text.

14
00:00:41.697 --> 00:00:46.693
I'd like you to markup
the HTML appropriately.

15
00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:48.374
This is the way it's supposed to look.

16
00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:51.578
You have the oxygen and oxygen motto.

17
00:00:51.578 --> 00:00:54.284
Fonts, which we have continued to use.

18
00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:58.109
The CSS that we wrote earlier
should carry into this code pen.

19
00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.118
In other words, you don't have to
rewrite everything from the beginning.

20
00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:04.171
Copy over the CSS that exists so far.

21
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:08.756
And then you'll continue to add to
that CSS as you work on this contact

22
00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:10.270
portion of the webpage
