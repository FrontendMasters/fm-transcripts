1
00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:03.499
So how'd y'all deal with
that particular example?

2
00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:05.174
Hopefully, you did okay.

3
00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:11.102
Let's go through my answer here on the
code pen, and so we are in chapter two.

4
00:00:11.102 --> 00:00:15.184
This is part four, and this was my
solution to the particular problem,

5
00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:19.744
you of course, you may have a slightly
different solution that doesn't make,

6
00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:21.186
your solution invalid.

7
00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:24.954
There's never one solution to
these particular problems.

8
00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:29.727
So we'll go through here my HTML first
because all good things start with

9
00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:30.675
good markup.

10
00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:33.596
So we start off with
a section of the webpage.

11
00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:38.168
So we started that pattern with
the introduction being a section.

12
00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:40.305
So this is also a section of the webpage.

13
00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:42.696
I'm gonna use the section
element here as well.

14
00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:47.624
I'm also gonna use an ID of contact cuz
again I'm gonna wind up using that for

15
00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:49.472
some in-page navigation,

16
00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:54.106
we'll talk more about exactly how that
works when we get to the nav bar.

17
00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:56.888
Which is the next thing we're gonna cover.

18
00:00:56.888 --> 00:01:01.539
Then mark this up is an h2 for contact me
because once again we have the h1 have

19
00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.560
already given that away,
we have the h1, on the page elsewhere.

20
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.564
So this is equally important as
a heading for this particular section.

21
00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:15.540
And then I have a paragraph describing
the kinds of things that I'm interested in

22
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.778
being contacted about.

23
00:01:16.778 --> 00:01:20.795
You're welcome to of course update
that to whatever you want it to say.

24
00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:27.165
And then I have the link at the bottom and
I have set that up to, as a mail to link.

25
00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:29.890
If you're not familiar with
this kind of link here.

26
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.971
You simply start your link with mail to,
all one word,

27
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:36.471
followed by your email address.

28
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:41.211
And in a perfect world when this button
is clicked this is going to open up

29
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:46.362
whatever email is set by default on your
computer and it will start a message.

30
00:01:46.362 --> 00:01:50.455
So, mine is a Gmail type
of environment for example.

31
00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:55.138
So when you click that particular link,
it will open up a message for

32
00:01:55.138 --> 00:01:58.353
me in Gmail so
I can write an email right there.

33
00:01:58.353 --> 00:02:02.349
A better way to do this probably
is an actual form with a,

34
00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.910
some kind of processing behind it.

35
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.915
There are many ways you can write that.

36
00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:12.075
You could, of course, write it all
out with standard HTML form and

37
00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:16.328
come up with some kind of
processing script behind it.

38
00:02:16.328 --> 00:02:21.520
You could use one of the off the shelf
kind of no code type of solutions,

39
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.871
so something like a Google form for
example.

40
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.867
Or type form or,

41
00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:30.160
there's a whole bunch of different
possibilities out there for that.

42
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.543
And maybe embed that in
the page as an iframe,

43
00:02:32.543 --> 00:02:34.810
that would be another
way to go about this.

44
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.990
So, these email links tend
not to be used all that

45
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.094
much because there are some
downsides to them,

46
00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:46.239
notably if people don't have email
configured on that particular computer.

47
00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.059
Okay, so let's go through what
the CSS winds up looking like then.

48
00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:57.672
So I added my CSX section down here,
just after my introductory information,

49
00:02:57.672 --> 00:03:01.171
all of the other stuff
that we wrote previously.

50
00:03:01.171 --> 00:03:06.546
And so here, in my contact
section I set a width for it.

51
00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:11.099
I've only 400 pixels,
and I centered the text,

52
00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.169
center align the text, and
set my margin to zero auto, and

53
00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:22.191
this is a way of aligning elements
on the webpage and centering them.

54
00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:26.737
So in this particular case, remember
when you have margin or padding and

55
00:03:26.737 --> 00:03:31.299
you have two numbers, the first number
refers to the top and the bottom.

56
00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.879
The second number refers to the left and
the right.

57
00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.738
And so margin zero auto works
hand in hand with a width value.

58
00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:42.585
So in this case the width
value is 400 pixels.

59
00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:46.987
And what this is saying is, don't put
any margin on the top of the bottom,

60
00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:47.779
obviously.

61
00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:51.755
And then whatever extra space
there is beyond 400 pixels, Mr.

62
00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:54.385
Browser, I'd like you to take that space.

63
00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:58.811
I'd like you to divide it in half and
stick it evenly on the left and

64
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:01.160
the right of that particular box.

65
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.108
So it centers the whole
box on the webpage.

66
00:04:04.108 --> 00:04:07.370
Again, you could have used
a Flexbox to do this, but

67
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.605
we haven't gotten to Flexbox yet.

68
00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:13.163
This is an old school way of doing it,
it's absolutely legit.

69
00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:16.040
It continues to work really, really well.

70
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.506
And then I added a little bit of
padding on the top of the bottom, so

71
00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:23.665
they will have a little bit of breathing
room as we start to stack these things up

72
00:04:23.665 --> 00:04:24.565
on the webpage.

73
00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:27.609
And then on my last paragraph
you could have done this,

74
00:04:27.609 --> 00:04:30.587
once again, you could have done this,
with a class,

75
00:04:30.587 --> 00:04:34.900
you could have assigned a class to this
paragraph with the email me link on it.

76
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.867
In my case I simply said,
this pseudo class of last child.

77
00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:41.093
So what does that mean?

78
00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:45.391
That means take a look at all of the
paragraphs that are here inside of this

79
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:50.395
document, pick the last one that's here,
the last child of the contact section and

80
00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:53.162
give it some padding at
the top of three rooms.

81
00:04:53.162 --> 00:04:56.629
So give us a little bit of
breathing room there as well.

82
00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.317
Now the one thing here that might look
a little bit odd to you is that I've

83
00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:03.281
made the entire page purple.

84
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:06.507
And that is because up
here in my body element,

85
00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:09.837
I changed my background color to plump,
okay?

86
00:05:09.837 --> 00:05:14.303
So we know that we're headed towards
this goal of putting everything

87
00:05:14.303 --> 00:05:15.847
together in a webpage.

88
00:05:15.847 --> 00:05:20.777
So my introductory text now has
a body background color of black, and

89
00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:24.942
my contact section has a body
background color of purple,

90
00:05:24.942 --> 00:05:27.918
we'll eventually need to resolve that.

91
00:05:27.918 --> 00:05:30.091
But I'm not gonna worry about that for
the moment.

92
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:32.934
We've basically got what's going on here.

93
00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:36.379
File that away in the back of your head
that we're gonna need to think about how

94
00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.823
we're gonna change the colours for
the backgrounds.

95
00:05:38.823 --> 00:05:43.541
The intro versus the contact
section when we eventually assemble

96
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:45.263
this into our webpage.

97
00:05:45.263 --> 00:05:47.583
Any questions on this particular problem?

98
00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:50.088
&gt;&gt; Should we add this to
our existing code pen?

99
00:05:50.088 --> 00:05:52.925
Or why are we making a new code pen for
this?

100
00:05:52.925 --> 00:05:57.574
&gt;&gt; So my goal here is to sort of isolate
each part of this web page inside of its

101
00:05:57.574 --> 00:05:58.499
own code pen.

102
00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:01.166
I'm copying from through
the CSS as it goes, so

103
00:06:01.166 --> 00:06:03.445
we're creating a unified stylesheet.

104
00:06:03.445 --> 00:06:06.617
We don't have to keep redoing
a whole bunch of work from that,

105
00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:09.374
but I'm looking at each
piece of HTML individually.

106
00:06:09.374 --> 00:06:14.588
We are going to reassemble all
these elements that we're putting

107
00:06:14.588 --> 00:06:19.529
together into VS Code to make
an actual quote, real webpage.

108
00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.333
You can just keep this as its
own code pen for the moment and

109
00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:25.507
you'll refer back to this when we
get to that part of the course.
