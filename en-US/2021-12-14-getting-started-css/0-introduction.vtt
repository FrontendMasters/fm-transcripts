00:00:00.221 --> 00:00:02.396
Hey everyone, it's Jen Kramer,

2
00:00:02.396 --> 00:00:06.378
welcome to getting started with
CSS here at Front End masters.

3
00:00:06.378 --> 00:00:13.784
And today we are gonna be building a two
page website using only HTML and CSS.

4
00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:15.731
And it's going to be a portfolio site.

5
00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:19.529
Now, before I go get into all of that,
in terms of prerequisites and

6
00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.942
what we're going to do today and
our scheduled and so forth.

7
00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:25.016
Let's just address what I just said.

8
00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:30.839
We're going to build a two page
website using only HTML and CSS.

9
00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.183
Why on earth might we
want to do this in 2021?

10
00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:38.297
And that would be a really
great question to ask.

11
00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:41.971
There's lots of issues building
websites with only HTML and CSS.

12
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:46.340
We have issues of maintainability
of making changes across all of our

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.634
individual static pages have efficiencies
of code have all kinds of other things.

14
00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:54.541
You can come up with for objections.

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.800
But I want you to think of this
project in the following way.

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.670
I'm sure many of you
have been camping before.

17
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.011
You probably live in a very nice home or
a very nice apartment.

18
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:08.890
You have heat in air conditioning you
have food in your refrigerator or

19
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.609
you can call an order takeout.

20
00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:15.646
But yet, we still occasionally at
least some of us like to go camping.

21
00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:21.864
Depriving ourselves of all of those modern
conveniences to get out out into nature.

22
00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:26.054
And enjoy a very basic style of living.

23
00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:29.021
That is the way I want you to
think about this project today.

24
00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:32.302
If you build a website and
only HTML and CSS,

25
00:01:32.302 --> 00:01:36.749
you are forced to concentrate
on those particular skills.

26
00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.627
You can't rely on some framework
to write the code for you.

27
00:01:40.627 --> 00:01:44.280
You're not relying on some
kind of versioning system or

28
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.500
anything that runs on a command line or
all of the other various complications.

29
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.379
That we like to add to our
modern web development.

30
00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:57.353
All of which might make perfect sense when
you're building a site for production.

31
00:01:57.353 --> 00:02:01.838
But here today, we're gonna work
on our HTML and our CSS skills.

32
00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:05.674
And so we're gonna strip everything
down to an absolute minimum.

33
00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:09.743
So that is the philosophy
of what we are doing today.

34
00:02:09.743 --> 00:02:13.170
This course is going to be appropriate for
beginning beginners.

35
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.977
It's also probably pretty appropriate for
a lot of junior developers who might not

36
00:02:17.977 --> 00:02:21.835
have gotten a lot of HTML and
CSS training in your coding boot camp.

37
00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:26.532
And I bet even a few of you senior
developers will enjoy going back through

38
00:02:26.532 --> 00:02:30.238
this course reviewing some of the HTML and
CSS concepts.

39
00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:32.320
That you might have forgotten over time.
