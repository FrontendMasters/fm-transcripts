1
00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:04.716
So what I'd like for you to try is
the layout for the footer of this webpage.

2
00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:07.792
Once again,
I've given you a beginning CodePen,

3
00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:10.017
I'll show you what that looks like.

4
00:00:10.017 --> 00:00:13.395
Here it is, fill in your name,
fill in your title.

5
00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:17.249
Here's where you're gonna place
your LinkedIn, your GitHub, and

6
00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.513
your email links, and you can set up
your copyright statement here, okay?

7
00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:24.938
So you're gonna do everything that
we have talked about this morning.

8
00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:28.375
You're gonna start with
good semantic markup.

9
00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:32.120
This is the footer of the webpage,
that should be a hint to you.

10
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.307
This is a series of links here that
have icons associated with them,

11
00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:39.494
that should be a hint to you.

12
00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:44.089
It's gonna be about 400 pixels wide across
all dimensions, so you don't have to worry

13
00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.795
about responsive design, just worry
about getting it to work this way.

14
00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:51.247
And again, it'll work independently
inside of that CodePen.

15
00:00:51.247 --> 00:00:55.095
I have copied over into that introductory
CodePen all of the styles that we have

16
00:00:55.095 --> 00:00:57.968
generated through the navigation
portion of the course.

17
00:00:57.968 --> 00:01:00.535
It's already hooked up
to our Google Fonts, and

18
00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:04.361
it's hooked up to Font Awesome, so
you don't need to worry about that.

19
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:09.660
So go ahead and write that markup, put
in your icons and make them accessible,

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.935
and style it up so it looks just
like the image that I showed you.

21
00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.135
So I have up here my answer.

22
00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:30.507
And so, let's look at the HTML first,
because it always starts with great HTML.

23
00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:35.264
So first of all, I wrapped a footer
element around the whole thing because,

24
00:01:35.264 --> 00:01:39.668
of course, it's the footer of the webpage,
and so that makes sense.

25
00:01:39.668 --> 00:01:44.096
I have put in my name and my title.

26
00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:46.128
And then I have a series of links.

27
00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:50.934
Notice that I did not wrap this
series of links in a nav tag.

28
00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:55.496
That's because this is not major
navigation for the website.

29
00:01:55.496 --> 00:02:01.015
It's navigation, it should be a series
of links to be visited in any order.

30
00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:04.817
That is an unordered list
with some links inside of it.

31
00:02:04.817 --> 00:02:09.698
But major navigation usually gets the nav
element as opposed to things that often

32
00:02:09.698 --> 00:02:11.574
occur in the footer like this.

33
00:02:11.574 --> 00:02:14.409
Or privacy policies, and
terms and conditions, and

34
00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.700
that kind of stuff that you find in the
footer, generally doesn't get a nav tag.

35
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.697
If you put in a nav tag,
it's really not the end of the world.

36
00:02:22.697 --> 00:02:26.879
There is definitely some debate
on the nav element in whether

37
00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.801
it should be used just for major
navigation or all kinds of navigation.

38
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:33.874
That's the way that I interpret it though,
so

39
00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:35.958
that's why I don't have
a nav element there.

40
00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.923
If you put one in, that's awesome.

41
00:02:38.923 --> 00:02:43.616
Okay, so then, of course, we have pretty
much what you had before for LinkedIn,

42
00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:45.398
what we had before for GitHub.

43
00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:49.545
And then you could set up that mailto
link that I talked about earlier,

44
00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:52.017
you could set that up with the email here.

45
00:02:52.017 --> 00:02:55.527
Make sure that you have all those
text equivalents in place, and

46
00:02:55.527 --> 00:02:57.674
I set them all to be screen reader only.

47
00:02:57.674 --> 00:03:02.735
And then down here at the bottom of
the page, I have my copyright statement.

48
00:03:02.735 --> 00:03:07.308
And I have an element here that you
may not have heard about before or

49
00:03:07.308 --> 00:03:11.894
maybe you've been told not to use,
and that is the small element.

50
00:03:11.894 --> 00:03:17.318
So small just like B and I, this was
an element that we had back in the day.

51
00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:21.195
[COUGH] The opposite of
a small was big [LAUGH] and

52
00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:24.777
it was designed to make text small or big.

53
00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:29.248
It disappeared in HTML 4,
it came back in HTML 5, and

54
00:03:29.248 --> 00:03:34.814
the small element is now recommended for
small print, fine print.

55
00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:39.261
So disclaimers, for example,
or copyright statements, or

56
00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:41.654
other types of things like this,

57
00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:46.452
where it's sort of all of that terms and
conditions type of stuff.

58
00:03:46.452 --> 00:03:47.980
That is what small is used for, and

59
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.576
that's why I put it down here
in the copyright statement.

60
00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:54.375
If you didn't do that and you just have
a regular old paragraph, that's okay too.

61
00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:58.894
The small element is sort of
a higher level kind of element

62
00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:02.293
that you may not have already known about.

63
00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:09.895
We go into our CSS, so this is all of
the CSS prior to the footer element here.

64
00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:14.425
This is all of the CSS that we've
written so far in the course.

65
00:04:14.425 --> 00:04:16.268
And then to this, we add the following.

66
00:04:16.268 --> 00:04:20.611
So first of all, I align my text in
the center, I just put that right

67
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:25.355
on the footer element, and
text align is a property that's inherited.

68
00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:29.347
So that will carry through
into all of the descendant

69
00:04:29.347 --> 00:04:32.076
elements from the footer element.

70
00:04:32.076 --> 00:04:35.494
Then, of course,
we style up our unordered list.

71
00:04:35.494 --> 00:04:39.808
Just like I told you before,
I have a list-style-type of none and

72
00:04:39.808 --> 00:04:40.895
a padding of 0.

73
00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:43.406
I did keep some margin here in place,

74
00:04:43.406 --> 00:04:47.954
although it looks like it's not
displaying over here in CodePen.

75
00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:53.449
But just to provide a little bit of space
when we copy this over into VS code,

76
00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.079
which is what we're gonna do next.

77
00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:00.179
And then, of course, I turned it into
a nav bar by making it display flex,

78
00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:02.710
row wrap, justify-content in the center.

79
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.414
I gave it a nice fat gap, cuz again,
finger navigation on a phone,

80
00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:10.438
you wanna have a nice
big clickable area and

81
00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:15.492
you wanna have space between those links,
and pumped up the font size.

82
00:05:15.492 --> 00:05:21.447
So I pretty much styled the footer
here in just two styles.

83
00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:25.452
And the rest of the stuff
carries in from the navigation,

84
00:05:25.452 --> 00:05:30.051
and including the fact that we
have these magenta colored icons.

85
00:05:30.051 --> 00:05:34.240
And that when we roll our mouse over them,
they turn to the hot magenta color,

86
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.280
that all carries in actually
from some earlier styles.
