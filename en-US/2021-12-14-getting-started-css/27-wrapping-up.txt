>> All right, so that winds up being the end of the course here at this point in time. We have built a two page website that we set out to create. We made our homepage, we made a very complex layout. We have our About page which is actually a subset of that layout.

[00:00:14]
We've gone through and tested everything, and made sure that our links are going together correctly. That we are being skipped down the page appropriately, or shifted to another page appropriately on the website. And you will find here that in the instructions for chapter seven, I've given you some additional options that you can add to the site at this point in time.

[00:00:38]
You can add hamburger buttons and drop-down menus and additional projects and all kinds of other things if you wanna continue building this particular website. If you're looking for some next steps for this course, the next thing I would recommend for you to work on would be my flexbox and grid course here at Frontend Masters.

[00:00:58]
That is going to teach you more about the layouts in much more detail than I've gone through here. So here you got a little tiny little baby introduction to some of those technologies. That course will take you into flexbox and grid very deeply. And will teach you lots and lots of different tricks and tips for working with CSS layouts, and really build your skills and your confidence.

[00:01:21]
So thank you all so much for watching. I really appreciate it. I hope you enjoyed today's work. And I hope to see you in the future at another Frontend Masters course. Thanks so much.
