00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.561
Okay so the last piece that
I want to cover here for

2
00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:06.083
our navbar is making it responsive.

3
00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:10.398
So right now, our navbar is configured
such that it looks the same across

4
00:00:10.398 --> 00:00:12.321
all screen dimensions, okay?

5
00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:17.777
And I discussed earlier that this has got
maybe some issues when it goes to mobile,

6
00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:21.830
it would be better off maybe
having a hamburger button.

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.770
I have that covered elsewhere in
the Frontend Masters curriculum.

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.832
We're not gonna add it
here in this course.

9
00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:30.360
But when it gets big, we probably
like this to all go in one line.

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.973
And in fact,
in our final portfolio website,

11
00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:36.197
you see how I've got my name
pushed over here to the left.

12
00:00:36.197 --> 00:00:39.100
I've got my navigation
over here on the right.

13
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.611
And when I make this screen smaller,

14
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:45.320
then it rearranges itself
at some point in time.

15
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.820
So that is what I mean
by making it responsive.

16
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.852
We're gonna change the way this page is
laid out when we get to what's called

17
00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.180
a break point.

18
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.251
So and we can define that as some
screen width on our website.

19
00:00:57.251 --> 00:00:59.643
So let me show you how to set that up.

20
00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:09.779
So right here after all of the styles that
are here in my style sheet currently.

21
00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:13.445
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to add a media query,

22
00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:15.930
which is part of responsive design.

23
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.009
I talk a lot about responsive design
in my course here at Frontend Masters,

24
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.350
which is all about flexbox and grid.

25
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.411
That will walk you through all of
the details of responsive design and

26
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:26.160
how this works.

27
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.650
This is a really brief lesson.

28
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.291
And the way we're gonna set this up
is with what's called a media query.

29
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.887
And it looks like this at media and

30
00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:40.078
we're going to say a minimum
width of 850 pixels.

31
00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:41.172
Why 850?

32
00:01:41.172 --> 00:01:47.774
Because extensive testing showed that
this was the right point to put those.

33
00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.690
You can make that number,
whatever you like.

34
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.888
And we're gonna put in a couple of
brackets and then inside of this,

35
00:01:55.888 --> 00:02:00.858
we can put in styles that will become
effective only when the window is at least

36
00:02:00.858 --> 00:02:02.790
850 pixels wide.

37
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.360
So in other words, 851, 1000 pixels,
1200 pixels and so forth.

38
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.790
As that window gets wider,

39
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.840
these are the styles that will apply
because they're later in the document.

40
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.440
They're gonna override
anything that came before.

41
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.810
So what I'm going to say here
is I'm going to save for my nav.

42
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.286
I'm now going to put in a max
width of 1200 pixels because let's

43
00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:32.042
face it we have some really
big monitors these days and

44
00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:35.728
we could have this navbar
get really out of control.

45
00:02:35.728 --> 00:02:37.318
We could have my name so

46
00:02:37.318 --> 00:02:41.853
far separated from the navbar
that it would just be ridiculous.

47
00:02:41.853 --> 00:02:45.096
So let's sort of limit
that with that screen and

48
00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:51.750
we're gonna say no more than 1200 pixels
wide and we'll say margin of zero auto.

49
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.980
And as I mentioned before,
margins zero auto,

50
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.060
we'll center that very nicely on the page.

51
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.008
We may not see a lot of change
over here right now, but

52
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.130
that'll be important
as we get this set up.

53
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.669
Now the only other thing I need
to do is to take my name and

54
00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.830
put it back on the same
line as my navigation.

55
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.008
So the way we got it off of that before,
is here in the style with

56
00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:20.498
a nav li first child, we said,
we set the flex basis to 100%.

57
00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:23.090
So it took up a full width of a line.

58
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.670
Now what I want to do is I want it
to take up whatever flexbox says.

59
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.905
So we're gonna just reset that here inside
of our media query nav li first child.

60
00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:38.975
The flex basis will be auto, okay?

61
00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:42.884
So a 100% is no longer in effect that will

62
00:03:42.884 --> 00:03:47.228
immediately put it back
down onto the same line.

63
00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:53.860
And here it is centered on the page,
I'm also gonna turn off that centering.

64
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.530
Remember we text align the words in
the center of that particular box.

65
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.000
I'm gonna turn that off also,
text, align left, okay?

66
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.402
Again, you may not see much
change here immediately, but

67
00:04:09.402 --> 00:04:11.950
it'll be important in just a moment.

68
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.612
Because the last thing
we'll add to this as we're

69
00:04:16.612 --> 00:04:20.730
gonna say margin, hyphen, right, auto.

70
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.655
And that's the magic sauce that will
push the logo way over to the left and

71
00:04:25.655 --> 00:04:29.560
the rest of the navbar all
the way over to the right.

72
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.562
So rather than flexbox, without this,

73
00:04:32.562 --> 00:04:36.020
what's going on is take that out for
a second.

74
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.290
What's happening now is the default
flexbox that we already set.

75
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.110
We said take everything center
it in the middle of the line.

76
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.784
And so the extra space right now that's
associated with that line is evenly split

77
00:04:49.784 --> 00:04:52.807
between the left and
right side outside of the logo,

78
00:04:52.807 --> 00:04:55.670
outside of that last navigation item.

79
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.126
By adding the line here.

80
00:04:59.774 --> 00:05:04.859
Margin-right auto, I'm taking all of that
space from the outside of my navbar,

81
00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:09.370
and I'm putting it in between the first
child and the rest of the navbar.

82
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:18.540
So now because right now my code
pin is over 850 pixels wide.

83
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.300
This is the way the navbar looks as I make
it smaller, see how it changes its layout.

84
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.960
So that is as simple as we can make
responsive design right there.

85
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.780
Just responded to a different screen
size in just a couple of CSS styles.
