00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.770
So we're gonna now go into
this last little part.

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.910
And there's two things I wanna do.

3
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.040
First, I did wanna show you a plugin
that I think embodies vim correctly.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.233
It was written by this person
I did tweet out, I asked him,

5
00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:18.530
Timothy Pope as the Pope of vim which
of his two pictures could we use?

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.226
And of course, instead someone just
made this which I feel like is

7
00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:25.260
the most appropriate form
we could make for Tim Pope.

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.610
It contains all the right
facets to be able to do this.

9
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.550
There we go, everything's ready,
we're awesome.

10
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.920
See, I'm still using plug, just like
what I showed you to use plug's great.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.499
All right, so
I don't think anything broke.

12
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.910
So the plug I really
like is called Fugitive.

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.110
If I do this what it is is Fugitive
allows you to look and get, right?

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.077
There's a whole set of things around get,
now it why in bodies the vim kind

15
00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:58.884
of spirit, is that I can walk up to it,
I can press a single character and

16
00:00:58.884 --> 00:01:02.600
it does exactly what I think
I'm gonna do as for stage.

17
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.470
I want to stage all of it.

18
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.920
I want to unstaged all of it.

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.910
I want to stage these two things.

20
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.280
I want to take this tea that we did and
I just want to get rid of it, right?

21
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.040
It's gone, it's not a part of this.

22
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.630
It's been deleted from my system.

23
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.370
It's also out of all of this.

24
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.287
I can add all these together and

25
00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:20.911
then I can press CZZ I've just
stashed all those changes.

26
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:25.437
They are now in my Get stash, I can do CCA
come right back to where we were be able

27
00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:30.470
to do that I can go on top of this, I can
look at the two differences between these.

28
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.806
I can go to the previous file,

29
00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:34.870
right you can actually see
right here I'm inside of get.

30
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.150
I'm actually inside of the other one,
the historical one.

31
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.010
I can navigate back out of
here I can go to the new one.

32
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.180
This is the one we're doing right now.

33
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.034
It has a bunch of stuff and everything
is all done via the keyboard but

34
00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:50.150
not just simply scrolling to each choice,
right.

35
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.891
So when I wanted to stash
CZZ it is just like another

36
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:55.080
command to do exactly what I want.

37
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.580
So, it takes a long time to get
to know all of these commands.

38
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.094
But in the end what makes it so powerful
is that it's just like the rest of

39
00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:10.170
vim when I wanna do something like muscle
memory takes over and it just does it.

40
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.649
I don't have to scroll to the right place
to be able to add the right things,

41
00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.950
I don't have to do all that instead,
I can just do the action.

42
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.790
I can do CC, I can go right
into a commit message, right?

43
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.360
Do all that committed,
you'll show me everything that's changed.

44
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.872
I can get push and
just push it right onto Master,

45
00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:28.200
so then nav playground you just
got a whole bunch of extra stuff.

46
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.214
And it's going to go do that I
luckily cloned it down with HTPS.

47
00:02:31.214 --> 00:02:32.675
So it doesn't work for me to push it up.

48
00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:34.221
It's gonna try to ask me to do that.

49
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:38.935
This is something that I think embodies
the right method which is whenever you're

50
00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:42.281
doing things with them,
you should try to think why am I not

51
00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.892
pressing like a couple
keys to do what I want?

52
00:02:44.892 --> 00:02:47.340
Why am I searching,
why am I taking this extra time?

53
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.307
Why am I treating it as if it's
like a mouse based UI, and

54
00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:52.730
I'm trying to find the right thing.

55
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.575
Something is fundamentally
broken about that and

56
00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:59.220
you'll never really enjoy
the fast speeds of at all.

57
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.836
If you're always having to do this
like kinda slow based searching to

58
00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:09.090
get everything done and that's kinda
how I think the ideal plug ins work.

59
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.609
It's also why I've said multiple times
that I'm not the biggest fan of fuzzy

60
00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.010
finders, I think fuzzy
finders are great stop gaps.

61
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.520
But if they're your primary form of
navigation, I do think it's wrong.

62
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.707
Because if you're in any sizable project,

63
00:03:22.707 --> 00:03:26.650
you have to type in a decent amount of
characters to get to where you want.

64
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.046
And then you end up having like just
the dumbest set of characters in your head

65
00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:32.110
like I need to go to performance handler.

66
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.030
I'm gonna go capital PE,
capital HAND, right?

67
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.342
You have to come up with like all these
ways to be able to get to what you want

68
00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:42.970
and it's like never the right way, right?

69
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.810
That's kind of how I think about it
Is that great for stopgap, great for

70
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.400
the zero 60 but there has to be better.

71
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.920
Well, the next thing you can do is you can
always use your already loaded buffers.

72
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.250
This is better, because then the amount
of stuff you type is much smaller, right?

73
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.987
Now it's smaller,
it's a little bit easy but still,

74
00:04:00.987 --> 00:04:03.550
there's a lot of cognitive overhead.

75
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.464
I just think something about this still
doesn't feel quite the right way and

76
00:04:08.464 --> 00:04:13.451
I think this works with any plug in you
use requires you to think a lot instead of

77
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:18.960
memorizing some command that becomes
second nature as you use it enough times.

78
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.850
I feel like something's broken about that.

79
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.520
Some things you just can't
get away from new project.

80
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.740
You got a fuzzy find your way in.
