00:00:00.684 --> 00:00:04.045
So anyway, so
let's talk about fuzzy finding, so for

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:08.938
a moment, I am gonna take a quick break
from what we're doing and kind of break,

3
00:00:08.938 --> 00:00:11.586
just being in completely unused Finland.

4
00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:15.033
And what I'm gonna do instead is I'm I
want to go seated to my tools, and

5
00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:18.192
I'm gonna to execute ready and
so, now this is rewriting my end,

6
00:00:18.192 --> 00:00:20.214
what it didn't do is install my plugins.

7
00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:22.806
So I'm gonna to open up vim, and
I'm gonna to go a plug install,

8
00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.694
which I believe everything should
already be installed, there we go.

9
00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:29.949
Now, when I use Ctrl + P notice I get
a nice open up window really quickly,

10
00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.227
I can also do that, right, it goes
right to it also this .c, there we go.

11
00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:37.034
Look at this,
it's even giving me this sweet LSP era,

12
00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:39.782
use of undeclared identifier,
fantastic, right,

13
00:00:39.782 --> 00:00:43.039
there's a lot in my personal
experience that's much better.

14
00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.378
Also notice that the coloring, much
better, but the big thing I wanted to show

15
00:00:47.378 --> 00:00:51.209
you is that I do have a fuzzy friend or
not only do I have a fuzzy finder.

16
00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:55.870
It also allows for using
the highlighting of my current highlight

17
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.761
scheme to actually show it in a preview.

18
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.477
Which means that I can actually
reduce down the view and

19
00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:04.903
do some pretty cool things,
I can do some really cool things with it,

20
00:01:04.903 --> 00:01:07.167
such as take this,
send it to a special list.

21
00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.492
And then I can walk through that
list really, really quickly and

22
00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:13.766
it's super neat but
we're gonna save that for later anyways.

23
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:17.302
So I just wanted to show you that I wanted
you to all see that that there is a much

24
00:01:17.302 --> 00:01:19.975
better experience,
we're just not there yet, right?

25
00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:21.566
We're still just using them or

26
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:25.971
just using some of the basics that plug-in
was called telescope, it's beautiful,

27
00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:30.517
all right, so let's move on, let's look at
another form of navigation called marks.

28
00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:36.668
All right, so marks pretty much are what
they sound like, you can bookmark a file.

29
00:01:36.668 --> 00:01:39.146
So the first thing I need to do
is I'm gonna come in here and

30
00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:40.552
I'm gonna go ready-no-env.

31
00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:44.537
I'm gonna go back to my number one
stage actually harmed before I do that,

32
00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:48.091
go ready and then I'm gonna go ready,
no and I believe stage two.

33
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:52.971
I think that's where we're at,
let me just make sure there we go, good,

34
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:58.032
okay, so we were just where we are at,
awesome, so we're gonna use marks.

35
00:01:58.032 --> 00:02:03.324
So let's reopen up our vim net,
you know our vim now playground, vim dot,

36
00:02:03.324 --> 00:02:08.876
let's navigate the way you want either
using E and typing it into twitch dot c.

37
00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:13.500
Or just navigating to source navigating
to twitch dot c and pressing enter,

38
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.677
pick a place randomly in the file,
and then press M,

39
00:02:16.677 --> 00:02:20.380
now, notice down low,
like right there, you'll see an M.

40
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.988
That means I'm in the middle of some sort
of command right now, and then pick your

41
00:02:23.988 --> 00:02:27.142
favorite capital letter you'd like
to use to come back to this point.

42
00:02:27.142 --> 00:02:32.207
I'm gonna use capital A, so
now i have a mark named capital A,

43
00:02:32.207 --> 00:02:36.506
at this position, so
let's go to a different file.

44
00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:40.937
If you're in the same file as me, you
should be able to do a space PV if you've

45
00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:44.358
done that and see some other files,
let's go to this one.

46
00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:48.296
I'm gonna use that really sweet shortcut I
told you Ctrl WO to close everything else

47
00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:51.859
down, I'm going to go down to the for
loop, and I'm going to do another M.

48
00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.687
Once again, you can saw, you can see it
and you're gonna pick another capital

49
00:02:55.687 --> 00:02:58.761
letter, don't pick A if you've
already used A because then,

50
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.576
you're gonna blow it away, right?

51
00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:06.046
I'm gonna use Shift + B, there we go,
so I have A and B, now, when I press

52
00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:11.545
just a single quotes and a capital A,
it will take me back to my first mark.

53
00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:15.767
Now, the reason why we chose
capital letters is that there's two

54
00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:20.295
types of marks, there are global marks,
there are file level marks,

55
00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:23.000
let's I'll show you what I mean by that.

56
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.770
So I'm gonna go down here and I'm gonna
do an M, and I'm going to do lowercase C,

57
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.469
you can see right there, look at that MC
and now when I press tick, lowercase C,

58
00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:33.680
I'll jump to that.

59
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.251
Now, let's do or not tick,
sorry, single quote, capital B,

60
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:43.857
I'll jump to the other file, now,
notice when I do single quote lowercase C.

61
00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:48.801
It goes hey, marks not set that does
not exist within this buffer, so

62
00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:51.444
you can do both buffer level marks and

63
00:03:51.444 --> 00:03:55.552
you can do global marks which
will work across a project.

64
00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:59.931
And so, that kind of lends itself
to a nice feel, personally though,

65
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:01.725
I'm not a huge fan of marks.

66
00:04:01.725 --> 00:04:05.174
They feel like they have a lot of overhead
and you have to remember things and

67
00:04:05.174 --> 00:04:07.438
I've tried different methods for
using marks.

68
00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:10.580
I know some people love them marks,
I just haven't got there,

69
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.696
maybe I'm just not good enough at vim yet
to be able to really achieve such a level.

70
00:04:14.696 --> 00:04:18.373
So instead, I actually wrote my own file
navigation plugin, which I'll hopefully

71
00:04:18.373 --> 00:04:21.862
have the time to show you later, which I
think is the most ideal way to navigate.

72
00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:25.894
But in the end marks are a great way for
you to be able to have a file one

73
00:04:25.894 --> 00:04:30.003
strategy I did hear that I thought
was pretty interesting was that,

74
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:33.558
you would set a mark for
the main function of your program.

75
00:04:33.558 --> 00:04:37.610
And you do it for every single project
with the same key, that way if you

76
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.817
ever wanted to go to Maine, you do
like single quote m capital M, right?

77
00:04:41.817 --> 00:04:46.422
And so, for every project it had the same
meaning and this is much more pneumonic,

78
00:04:46.422 --> 00:04:49.313
it's much easier to kind
of like keep in your head.

79
00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:53.834
And so, to me, using marks like that
could actually be pretty beneficial,

80
00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:58.302
I just haven't quite got there yet,
I haven't found my way of using them.

81
00:04:58.302 --> 00:05:00.880
If anyone has any great ideas or anything,

82
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.330
please message me, tell me how you do it,
I'd love to try a new strategy.
