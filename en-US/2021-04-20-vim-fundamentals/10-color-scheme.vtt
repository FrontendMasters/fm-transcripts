00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.363
So let's keep on going let's
change our color scheme,

2
00:00:03.363 --> 00:00:06.126
right because that color
scheme is atrocious.

3
00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:10.850
So let's what beautiful default
options then has for all of us.

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.579
So what we're going to do is we're
going to type in color scheme and

5
00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.230
to our editor so everyone,
go in there, go into command mode.

6
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.310
Remember, type in colon and
go color and then hit Ctrl + D.

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.711
See what comes up?

8
00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:26.014
Well, you can see there's
only one option color scheme.

9
00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:30.701
So I'm gonna hit Tab, it auto fills it for
me, but what color schemes are available?

10
00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:35.785
What do you think you
should press Ctrl + D.

11
00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.411
Hopefully you're thinking Ctrl + D, we've
been going over this, you can hit Ctrl +D,

12
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:40.730
you can also hit tTab.

13
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.687
Right now, if you have a blank Vimrc,
you should see effectively the same set

14
00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:49.513
of options right here that I see and
you could just pick one.

15
00:00:49.513 --> 00:00:51.298
Try picking out a couple,

16
00:00:51.298 --> 00:00:55.449
see which horrifying as color
schemes feel the best for you.

17
00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.334
Me personally,
I'm gonna probably pick desert.

18
00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:00.410
It just feels a little bit better.

19
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.220
And when I look at that beautiful code,
I got that bright green, man.

20
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.200
Like, look at that.

21
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.674
Look at how beautiful these colors are,
right?

22
00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:12.133
We'll pick out some better ones here soon,
but you can know that you can do this so

23
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.130
I can set my color scheme.

24
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.780
You wanna guess how we're going
to make the color scheme stick?

25
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.568
How would we make it
persist between sessions?

26
00:01:22.568 --> 00:01:27.956
Wait, I think we all know at this point,
open up your Vimrc.

27
00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:32.139
Go to it, go to the bottom,
now here's the fun little facts for you.

28
00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:34.754
If you do Shift + G, capital G,
you'll go to the bottom.

29
00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:36.761
GG for good game starts at the top.

30
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.960
Alright, so Shift + G, go to the bottom,
hit O, add a new space in there,

31
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.740
type in color scheme, and
then just do whatever one you chose.

32
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.180
I chose desert, there we go,
I have it, awesome.

33
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.609
I'm gonna escape, right boom, reopen it
back up and notice it's now different.

34
00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.791
I now have a saved color scheme
that's being selected, and

35
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:58.600
I have a new set of colors.

36
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.340
Slightly less offensive to the eyes,
but still fairly offensive to the eyes.

37
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.640
So if I hold, I think LSU I
think they're purple and yellow.

38
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.900
So if I hold any LSU fans.

39
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.590
Come on man, those are cool colors.

40
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.540
Okay, sure, anyhow so now we've done it.

41
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.661
We're starting to get our Vimrc.

42
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:20.530
Hopefully everyone's feeling
a little bit more confident.

43
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.640
You start to see how this game's gonna go.

44
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.134
We're gonna see things we don't like, or

45
00:02:25.134 --> 00:02:28.280
we're gonna find things
we want differently.

46
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.040
We now need to edit our Vimrc and
make it different every time, right?

47
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.500
Alright, so let's go back.

48
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.000
And I think that's really all I had to do.

49
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.969
Yeah, there's the recap.

50
00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.640
Yeah, what we've learned we've learned so
many different things.

51
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.860
I already explained everything
what we learned, but we'll do it.
