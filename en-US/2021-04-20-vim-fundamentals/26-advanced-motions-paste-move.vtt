00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
The question is, I just highlighted
some small space using visual mode

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.010
meaning not visual line mode visual mode.

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.435
But when I pasted it paste on that line,
I wanna be able to get a new line in and

4
00:00:11.435 --> 00:00:14.809
do that effectively doing an O for
me, leaving insert and

5
00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.377
then pasting it in right?

6
00:00:16.377 --> 00:00:19.829
So let's go and edit our vim RC.

7
00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.650
We can go down here, and we can actually
just make up our own one right now.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.410
We can do, how about this one?

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.850
Leader P.
So I'm gonna do space P.

10
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.140
And what it's gonna do is it's
going to do O, so now I've done O,

11
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.783
let me erase this thing.

12
00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:40.175
I've done an O, I've created a new line
at this point I'm in no remap mode right?

13
00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:43.580
And then I'm gonna do a paste and
there we go.

14
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.610
So I believe that should be it.

15
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.630
It might be a shift pace.

16
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.380
I think it's a shift pace.

17
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.970
There we go.

18
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.540
So I'm going to take this and
let's see what happens.

19
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.530
Let's shout out percent sign.

20
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.660
There we go.
I'm going to highlight just this word.

21
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.790
I'm gonna yank it, and
I'm gonna go leader P.

22
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.560
There we go, awesome,

23
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.340
I already had something called
with a different Pete lipsy.

24
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.960
We forgot to leave insert mode escape.

25
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.530
There we go, shout out, remember I
have an already a leader p map item.

26
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.170
That's why there's that long wait,
but let's just imagine that I don't so

27
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.680
leader p.

28
00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:20.891
My goodness, what did I do?

29
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:24.417
I forget the shout it out.

30
00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.665
I copied that, that's why.

31
00:01:25.665 --> 00:01:27.769
[SOUND] All right there we go.

32
00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:30.260
So let's yank it, leader P.

33
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.426
There we go.
We just went and

34
00:01:31.426 --> 00:01:33.720
we just did that little bit
off when you get the idea.

35
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.810
So if I noticed that I enter, and a little
bit down, I could follow it up with the j.

36
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.125
Shout it out, looks.

37
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:43.150
Well that's not what i'm
supposed to be doing.

38
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.380
I must have done something wrong here.

39
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.849
I copy that somewhere else?

40
00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.590
Supposed to be sourcing but anyways,
so let's just source percent sign.

41
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.056
So i should be able to leader P and
now should paste it and

42
00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:57.840
i should be able to go up j is the wrong
way, you get the idea though, right?

43
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.830
I meant to do k, here we go,
di word, take that, shout it out.

44
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.400
And leader p, there we go.

45
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.900
I was able to do it and
put myself back on that line.

46
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.307
So you can kind of experiment around and
play with this and

47
00:02:11.307 --> 00:02:13.150
create things you really like.

48
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.210
Now I do want to show you something.

49
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.747
So we've,

50
00:02:14.747 --> 00:02:18.360
we've kind of put all these things
together we have a bunch of knowledge.

51
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.935
Let me share with you some of my
favorite Remaps right now before we

52
00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:25.185
get into anything else because
this is just like, we're in

53
00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:29.689
the advanced text editing section, and so
I want to really add some awesome ones.

54
00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.840
So this one I think is
one of my favourite ones.

55
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.849
Now you have some yanked text, but
you don't want to lose it, right?

56
00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.549
You want to be able to paste it,
replace some text,

57
00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.920
but you don't wanna lose
your original yank.

58
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.373
Now there's a couple ways
we could go about this one,

59
00:02:48.373 --> 00:02:53.208
you could use your history to re paste
back out or paste from your history and

60
00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:57.700
always keep using it or two,
we could create a really awesome remap.

61
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.010
I'm always in favor of super awesome
remaps [COUGH] so let's do it.

62
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.162
So this what we're gonna do, we're gonna
like this when we're in visual mode,

63
00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:11.050
no recursive execution map.

64
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.134
We're then gonna go leader p, right?

65
00:03:13.134 --> 00:03:17.210
Elite hair P that's the English
version doesn't work.

66
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.290
We're gonna do liter P, and
we're gonna do quotes underscore P.

67
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.760
Now what this R quote
underscore d capital P.

68
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.136
What this is gonna do is we're gonna
delete our current selection and

69
00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:32.550
send it to the void register.

70
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.105
The Void register is simply a death knell,
right?

71
00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:37.200
It's gonna yank it to nowhere.

72
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.360
And that's it, so let's shout out this and
let's do foo bar bass.

73
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.500
So I'm gonna take foo, I'm gonna
highlight it, and then I'm gonna, shit,

74
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.160
I'm gonna highlight it, and
then leader P, I've now replaced it.

75
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.863
If I look at my registers,
you'll see I still have foo.

76
00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:56.660
Whereas if I didn't do that
I wouldn't have had it.

77
00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.344
So now I can do this again leader p I have
now replaced it again without losing my

78
00:04:01.344 --> 00:04:02.590
original one.

79
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.050
That's pretty damn awesome.

80
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.320
Those are one of those that are just
like just the greatest things ever.

81
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.970
There's one other one that I
didn't show you, paragraphs.

82
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.330
Remember how I told you about contiguous
blocks of code jumping by paragraph?

83
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.390
Well guess what DAP,
Delete by Paragraph, right?

84
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.602
Delete outsides of the paragraph boom,
works tip also works,

85
00:04:19.602 --> 00:04:22.279
you can delete contiguous
blocks of code like that.

86
00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.860
So let's do another one of
these really awesome ones.

87
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.800
I hope you're ready.

88
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.857
So in visual mode, leader y and

89
00:04:28.857 --> 00:04:33.930
let's do a plus sign right here,
and do that.

90
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.910
So what does this do?

91
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.640
Well, you don't know what
the plus register is.

92
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.298
The plus register, if you have the right
things installed, it doesn't always work

93
00:04:43.298 --> 00:04:47.822
on Mac, you have like, I think it's like
vim-gtk or something like that and then

94
00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:52.300
you have to ports install or brew install
or Asked as Tim Cook if you can instal it.

95
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.790
I don't know what Apple requires.

96
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.000
I know it's pretty locked down.

97
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.630
But once you get it on, it allows them to
communicate with your system clipboard.

98
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.000
I think Neovim has it by default maybe
then has it by default at this point.

99
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.040
It's been so long, I forget.

100
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.950
What it does is,
it will send it to your system clipboard.

101
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.090
So this is fantastic.

102
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.183
So now, when I do this, if I highlight
something and I go leader y.

103
00:05:14.183 --> 00:05:19.210
I now have yanked it but
I've yanked it into my Ctrl+V.

104
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.910
I now can paste into my system clipboard,
which is fantastic.

105
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.843
There is a mode to make it so that every
single yank will go into your system

106
00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:29.560
clipboard but
you don't always want that right?

107
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.040
Only sometimes do you want that I
had that mode on for a little bit.

108
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.255
But then I kept like losing stuff because
I was like, I'm gonna copy this address

109
00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:40.320
over here, I'm going to put inside
this doc, let me delete this.

110
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.160
Crap I just wrote over and again.

111
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.941
So instead I like to control when I go
into the system clipboard versus the vim

112
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:46.900
clipboard.

113
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.001
And so I found that just to be incredible.

114
00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:52.150
But wait, there's more.

115
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.026
So let's do the exact same thing but
in normal mode, so you're thinking,

116
00:05:56.026 --> 00:05:57.020
what does that do?

117
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.980
I mean, what what could that do?

118
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.770
Well, let me show you.

119
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.960
You'll see it down low, like right there.

120
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.780
I'm gonna go space y?

121
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.780
Now look at what it's actually typed for
me.

122
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.930
It typed the double quotes plus y.

123
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.590
I am now ready to yank into my clipboard,
but now I can do a motion.

124
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.932
How about ap let's highlight in yank
that whole continuous paragraph into my

125
00:06:20.932 --> 00:06:22.348
clipboard, all right?

126
00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:27.189
So you can now remap it in normal mode to
be able to grab these large sections of

127
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.229
text and
put them right into your clipboard.

128
00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.893
My goodness, this is the greatest thing
and I'd be just remiss if I did not

129
00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:39.576
mention as born it's a buddy of ours
on Twitch, he he turned me on to this.

130
00:06:39.576 --> 00:06:41.697
This was the greatest thing ever.

131
00:06:41.697 --> 00:06:45.440
This my goodness,
this is just I love this thing.

132
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.250
This is fantastic.

133
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.180
He also showed me one more.

134
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.380
That was fantastic.

135
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.003
He does capital Y, and then does
let's see what is that he does GGG.

136
00:06:54.003 --> 00:06:57.590
So you can imagine what this thing does.

137
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.205
g g goes to the top right?

138
00:06:59.205 --> 00:07:01.140
G goes down to the bottom.

139
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.850
Well if I go space y I just
copied the whole file, right?

140
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.212
And so it's like a quick way for

141
00:07:08.212 --> 00:07:11.400
me to build just grab the entire
file into my system clipboard.

142
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.990
So if I'm not,
if I'm in then this is fantastic.

143
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.409
Obviously from outside of them I can use
like x clip and pipe a file into it.

144
00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:19.548
Pretty simple, but if I'm in them,

145
00:07:19.548 --> 00:07:23.690
I can do the exact same thing without
going back out to the command line.

146
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.502
I find this to be very, very nice or

147
00:07:25.502 --> 00:07:28.770
having to do something like VG
go down here, space Y, right?

148
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.820
I don't want to have to do all that.

149
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.060
It's just a beautiful, beautiful thing.

150
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.450
There's a couple other ones but
I have to look them up.

151
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.350
And so let's just look these ones
up cuz they're very fantastic.

152
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.440
So these two are incredible.

153
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.010
I just always forget how to write them.

154
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.550
Effectively, remember when we highlight
a region and you press colon?

155
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.020
It puts these funny
characters down right here.

156
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.500
Those funny characters have real meanings.

157
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.130
Single quote opener is the beginning
of a highlighted region.

158
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.500
In a single quote close is
the end of a highlighting region.

159
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.560
And so effectively what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna do this special command

160
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.610
called a move, and I'm gonna move it
to the outside of a highlighted region.

161
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.440
And then I'm gonna hit enter.

162
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.430
Then I'm gonna highlight my
previous highlight which is gv,

163
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.995
very fantastic command, but
it's really only used for Like plugins, so

164
00:08:19.995 --> 00:08:21.503
if I go like this, watch this.

165
00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:23.885
I highlight this region I leave and
then I do gv,

166
00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:26.660
it will re highlight
my previous highlight.

167
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.368
I'm gonna press equal sign, which will
automatically indent or format my code,

168
00:08:31.368 --> 00:08:34.916
and then redo gv again,
which will re highlight my section and

169
00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:37.420
what effectively does this do?

170
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.858
Well, if I highlight this and do shift j,

171
00:08:40.858 --> 00:08:46.870
I can move code using capital K and
capital J, that's pretty darn neat.

172
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.618
And if there's functions,
this probably doesn't work, but

173
00:08:50.618 --> 00:08:53.520
if I do this, it does work, awesome.

174
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.163
It will automatically indent them and

175
00:08:55.163 --> 00:08:57.330
put them right where I
wanted them to be all right?

176
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.400
This is pretty darn cool.

177
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.130
All right, this is pretty darn legit.

178
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.010
Man, you just gotta come up
with these cool little remaps

179
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.300
to just do a lot of pretty awesome stuff.

180
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.290
Those are all fantastic.

181
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.381
They're just ways that I just make
them a little bit better, right?

182
00:09:11.381 --> 00:09:15.419
These are things that are just super
hard to express and other editors, but

183
00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:17.021
are super simple to do here and

184
00:09:17.021 --> 00:09:19.990
I just absolutely think that
that thing is fantastic.
