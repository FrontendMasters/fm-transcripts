1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.605
Awesome.
All right, so

2
00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:05.850
there's gonna be a bunch of curled files
that we'll need to get from time to time.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.480
So just be prepared.

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.080
I will be linking them in the chat.

5
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.840
Hopefully if, you're following along,
you can just copy and paste from here.

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.600
It's how we will go into them and
do the same thing together.

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.203
As I've said it before we're
gonna start when Adam and

8
00:00:19.203 --> 00:00:22.088
Eve were going from like the very,
very, very beginning and

9
00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.650
we gonna slowly build
a foundation that makes sense.

10
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.180
We gonna edit the files together.

11
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.490
We gonna walk through them together and
we gonna hopefully get to the end.

12
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.954
And as I've said earlier, motions where my
chief most important when I learned how to

13
00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:37.260
do it because I was using
a plugin inside of intelligent.

14
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.160
Today, those will be kind of the same
level of importance as other features of

15
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.240
VIM such as file navigation, being able
to do certain sets of actions, macros,

16
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.460
registers, quick fix lists, you name it,

17
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.790
we're gonna kind of go through
the whole gamut here today.

18
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:58.314
So let's open vim, go to your terminal and
just type in v i m and hit enter.

19
00:00:58.314 --> 00:01:02.670
Alright, so
now what are you supposed to do?

20
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.464
For a lot of people the first time you
open this, you're just like, well,

21
00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:09.430
that's fun.

22
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.888
Lots of WTF, lots of,
well, that's fun, but

23
00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:14.230
I have no idea what I'm
actually doing here.

24
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.320
I don't even know how to use this.

25
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.310
I don't even know how to do anything.

26
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.670
It's telling me to type all these things
to be able to go find stuff, and I'm like,

27
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.950
okay, check health.

28
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.083
Can i do push ups?

29
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.630
My goodness, i have all these like,
warnings and stuff.

30
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.582
How am i going to errors and just feels
like i don't even know what I'm doing now

31
00:01:28.582 --> 00:01:30.360
everything's gone all of a sudden.

32
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.350
It just feels weird, right?

33
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.623
Like, this is why when
people open up vim for

34
00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:39.171
the first time they
generate Sha 256 codes.

35
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:42.345
It's because you just start jamming
the keyboard until something happens, so

36
00:01:42.345 --> 00:01:43.000
let's quit.

37
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.240
By the way,
I didn't show you how to quit, press.

38
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.380
Okay.
Hey, Chuck.

39
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.980
Hey, don't tell anyone.

40
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.540
Okay, this is kind of a secret.

41
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.790
Don't tell anyone.

42
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.980
It's going to be this :q.

43
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.200
Hit enter.

44
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.920
When you do that you will leave in.

45
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.170
If that doesn't work for
you try the bathtub.

46
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.670
Just get it out, right.

47
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.170
It's, this is such a meme.

48
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.122
I came and believe it's such a meme, but

49
00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:10.230
every single day you'll see someone
not being able to exit vim.

50
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.940
And it's like hilarious.

51
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.885
There was recently a guy with a Mac
book pro with the touch bar and

52
00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:17.080
his escape key quit working.

53
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.800
And then he goes like
permanently stuck in vim.

54
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.930
He had no idea what to do.

55
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.140
And this was just a couple of weeks ago.

56
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.160
It was fantastic.

57
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.870
He wasn't technically stuck in vim,
he just didn't know how to escape.

58
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.108
Anyways, so if we could get a quick crowd
participation moment I know everyone just

59
00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.300
left but
I can always jump over to the chat.

60
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.930
What were you expecting to
see when you open up vim?

61
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.990
Does anyone have anything?

62
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.020
Anyone from the zoom class?

63
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.487
What were you expecting to see,
when you typed in v-i-m?

64
00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:45.620
&gt;&gt; An empty document.

65
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.630
&gt;&gt; An empty document?

66
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.130
Okay.

67
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.730
I bet a lot of people wanted
to see a file tree, right?

68
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.040
Was it weird not seeing that?

69
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.690
When you open up VS code, you see a file
tree you feel a little bit safer.

70
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.820
You see something on the side that
kind of orient you to where you're at.

71
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.550
You got nothing right?

72
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.960
And it felt confusing.

73
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.850
Someone's had an empty screen
from chat line numbers.

74
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.193
Yeah, maybe line numbers,
maybe something, just anything but

75
00:03:12.193 --> 00:03:16.890
it feels super disorienting when you
see nothing you're familiar with.

76
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.790
That's gonna be a pretty
regular occurrence for a while.

77
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.725
Okay?
We'll try to make it better, but

78
00:03:22.725 --> 00:03:25.090
in the end, it's gonna be pretty regular.

79
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.380
Al right, so let's move on.

80
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.530
Let's actually use vim this time.

81
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.370
All right, I hope everyone's ready.

82
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.266
So remember,
we're going to do the basic movements and

83
00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:36.220
all that here in a little bit.

84
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.100
But I'm going to just kind of walk you
through just doing your first edits.

85
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.502
So let's all open up vim together and
do vim test.js being an empty directory,

86
00:03:44.502 --> 00:03:46.090
it doesn't really matter.

87
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.311
Just don't be in a directory that has
a test.js or a test any language you like,

88
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:54.028
right, I'm just gonna use js because
I assume most people have a vague

89
00:03:54.028 --> 00:03:56.930
familiarity with JavaScript at this point.

90
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.110
So when I hit Enter,
I'll be presented a different screen.

91
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.070
Now notice that there is
at least a cue this time.

92
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.040
down here in the bottom.

93
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.050
You do see test.js.

94
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.369
Okay, at least we feel a little bit more
oriented, but I see no line numbers,

95
00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.990
I see nothing else, it feels confusing.

96
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.220
So let's just, write a for loop together.

97
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.930
So I'm gonna start typing, f o r.

98
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.380
Okay, why is that not working?

99
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.070
What?

100
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.280
We all just type f o r but
now everything's confusing.

101
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.968
Okay, open squirrely brace.

102
00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:27.650
My goodness, nothing's working.

103
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.740
What's happening?

104
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.470
That's because you were in the wrong mode.

105
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.320
So when I type in f o r, you'll notice
that like, it just nothing happens, right?

106
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.080
Okay, we got something yay.

107
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.782
Yeah, what just happened there?

108
00:04:40.782 --> 00:04:42.870
Here let me exit for a quick second.

109
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.150
You need to go into insert mode.

110
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.020
So everyone, press i.

111
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.370
Now when you press I,
what you'll see down here is insert mode.

112
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.180
This is letting you know where you're at.

113
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.493
So now, you know, you're in test.js, and
you're insert mode, insert mode will for

114
00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:01.860
the most part act just like anything else.

115
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.790
And by the way, I do use the Vortec.

116
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.180
If you can't tell there's
no ASDFs right here.

117
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.460
It's all AOEUs.

118
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.780
And so
that might be a little bit different.

119
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.570
So if you see me typing something weird,
that's probably what's happening.

120
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.019
So when you're in insert mode,
you can freely type.

121
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.440
One thing that won't work.

122
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.442
So if I start typing, for,
there's not usually that many semi-colons,

123
00:05:22.442 --> 00:05:23.890
I don't think.

124
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.464
When I'm doing this and I press enter,

125
00:05:26.464 --> 00:05:31.100
it will obviously give me a big indent,
now that's a tab.

126
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.078
You don't want a tab as you were typing
it you probably got a tab, I don't know

127
00:05:36.078 --> 00:05:41.150
if you want an eight space tab if you do
I'm power to you, but I don't use that.

128
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.150
I like four spaces.

129
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.440
This feels odd.

130
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.090
The colorings all wrong.

131
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.860
But hey, at least an auto invented for
me, right?

132
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.120
So what happened if I use shift key and
like move around with my arrows?

133
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.260
It's not, okay.

134
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.190
I don't man that feels funny, right?

135
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.840
Like you can't highlight text.

136
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.130
So what is this insert mode
that just feels wrong, right?

137
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.971
So let's jump back here and let's first
talk a little bit about modes honestly for

138
00:06:05.971 --> 00:06:07.400
a second.

139
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.665
So normal mode is where you edit text,
you modify it with delete,

140
00:06:12.665 --> 00:06:18.080
and yanking and pasting in and
putting it all over the place.

141
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.210
Insert mode is where you type new text.

142
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.490
So those are two different ones.

143
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.690
And then there's another
mode called visual mode.

144
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.977
There actually should be another
mode here, but for whatever reason,

145
00:06:27.977 --> 00:06:30.460
my GitHub Pages did not
update I'll just mention it.

146
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.780
So there probably is
a couple missing items here.

147
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.310
But there's visual mode.

148
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.763
Visual mode is equivalent to you using
your mouse and highlighting a section of

149
00:06:38.763 --> 00:06:43.000
text or using Ctrl and Shift and
the arrow keys to highlight the text.

150
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.453
And then you're able to yank it,
delete it or

151
00:06:45.453 --> 00:06:49.040
perform operations on top
of that highlighted region.

152
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.340
So it's a lot like using your mouse.

153
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.430
And so
there's one more mode called command mode.

154
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.620
When you're in normal mode and you
press colon, you can execute a command.

155
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.780
That's called command mode.

156
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.550
We'll use that from time to time.

157
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.800
But those are your basic modes.

158
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.550
There's some other ones.

159
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.950
Just don't worry about it.

160
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.341
If thing if you get into a goofy mode and
you don't really know what's happening,

161
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:10.020
press escape.

162
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.602
If that doesn't work, start doing
colon q until you're out of them and

163
00:07:12.602 --> 00:07:14.030
then just jump right back in.

164
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.600
You will learn how to get out of things
a little bit better as time goes on.

165
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.510
So, there we get we're in insert mode.

166
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.530
So how do you get out of insert mode?

167
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.748
You can press Escape,

168
00:07:23.748 --> 00:07:28.230
Escape will make your cursor go from that
thin cursor if you're using Neo Vim.

169
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.060
If you're using regular vim,
I believe you'll have a thick cursor.

170
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.074
You'll now notice that down here at
the bottom, there's no more Insert right,

171
00:07:35.074 --> 00:07:35.910
that went away.

172
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.850
You're now back into normal mode.

173
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.720
This may not feel normal.

174
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.410
But trust me, it's very normal.

175
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.540
It's just really normal.

176
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.410
Just accept it.

177
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.571
So anyways, so now there's other ways you
could actually get out of insert mode you

178
00:07:48.571 --> 00:07:51.137
can use control C you'll
see me using that a bunch.

179
00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:55.792
Control C does have a small implication in
a very specific use case that doesn't make

180
00:07:55.792 --> 00:08:00.340
it the same as escape, but we're not
gonna probably even run into that today.

181
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.800
There is also Ctrl+(,
which will also leave insert mode.

182
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.699
But for the most part either use escape
Ctrl+C Ctrl+(, whichever one you want for

183
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:15.253
today, whatever one feels the most
comfortable, because we can change it and

184
00:08:15.253 --> 00:08:19.820
we'll change it to the way you want it to
be here soon, just not at this moment.
