1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
I just pasted in the file
you should be curling down.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.629
If you use all my zest,
just type in C you press up, and

3
00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:06.970
you should be right back to it.

4
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.747
The file should be called
some javascript.md, and

5
00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:12.440
then you're gonna rename
it to exercise.js.

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.460
Awesome, awesome.

7
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.842
We're gonna go back in there, and
I've kept my spot if you haven't,

8
00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:21.290
remember the commands we
have executed thus far.

9
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.270
Where set scroll offset equals 8,

10
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.280
you can choose whatever number
makes you kinda feel comfortable.

11
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.791
That's just how many lines either below or
above, it will start auto scrolling for

12
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:34.120
you, as you get near the bottom or
the top.

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.470
Then we also did set number.

14
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.260
I don't know why it's not auto completing.

15
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.077
That puts the absolute position line
numbers, on the side of your editor.

16
00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:48.750
And then, we also did our new or
relative number.

17
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.490
We did all of them, right?

18
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.480
Relative number.

19
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.496
And that means, that from your cursor,
we're gonna to display the relative

20
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:01.350
offset to help you with faster and
more awesome than motions, right?

21
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.760
And so,
now we're gonna to start getting after it.

22
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.220
I can't quite remember what comes up next.

23
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.091
So we're gonna just kinda
look at it together, and

24
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:10.370
I think everyone's gonna
have a great time?

25
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.970
So anyways, so we've done this,
but here's the problem, right?

26
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.660
We did all these settings,
everything is awesome.

27
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.643
Everybody just quit with me for
one second quit bang,

28
00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:23.710
get out of there and
then just simply reopen it back up.

29
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.526
You can either re curl it back down,
or just simply open up exercise.js.

30
00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:31.160
Do that, and what's the problem?

31
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.160
Everything that we have put in,
gets forgotten, right?

32
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.380
And that is because vim,
does not save your settings.

33
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.330
You tell them what to do, it does not tell
you what to do, well, some of the times.

34
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.760
So anyways, so let's close this back down.

35
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.580
Now, for those who are using vim, you will
be opening up something called your vimrc.

36
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.120
And that will be located
in your home directory.

37
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.920
I just can do tilde a dot vimrc.

38
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.980
If you're using ill vim,
remember it's in your config path.

39
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.450
I showed you how to do it earlier.

40
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.480
I'll do it again really quickly right now.

41
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.093
You echo out stdpath config, and

42
00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:12.959
that will show you where you
have your a nit.vim, all right?

43
00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.546
So I'm gonna go here and I am gonna
edit my an edit.vim, which is a config,

44
00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:24.820
neo.vim and intvim, you edit yours,
so everyone should have an empty one.

45
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.736
If you've properly set up your
environment to have a clean environment,

46
00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:30.910
it should be empty, and
this should be really a new file.

47
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.852
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna do this set,

48
00:02:34.852 --> 00:02:39.920
scroll off equals 8, And
then I'll try to slow down there.

49
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.875
Remember, you can copy you can paste, so

50
00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:47.360
you can do your y your P to get
that previous line, do that.

51
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.700
Now, we can go over here, and
we can set the other options.

52
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.153
So let's dwinumber,
then you can hit Escape.

53
00:02:55.153 --> 00:02:58.190
You can go over one with l and dwdw.

54
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.260
You could have done xx,
you could have done some other things.

55
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.220
There's some other more faster,
and efficient ways to do that.

56
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.670
But for now,
I'm just kinda giving you the basics.

57
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.580
So let's do it again, let's yy, let's p.

58
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.040
Let's the p, but then press word over,
press I and then type in relative.

59
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.230
Now you'll notice, you have these
three options in your vimrc.

60
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.840
Now remember your vimrc, is simply
the identical thing to your command mode.

61
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.978
It reads one line at a time, and

62
00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:31.470
applies the settings you have
set into your vim experience.

63
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.744
So if I were to save this it'll
now say hey, you wrote it,

64
00:03:34.744 --> 00:03:38.101
you wrote it to this location,
which means I can now quit.

65
00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:40.920
And at this point,
I can reopen up that curl file here.

66
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.910
I'll just curl it back down again,
and look what we have.

67
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.890
Our setting has been saved.

68
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.870
As I move around, it moves it with me.

69
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.219
I no longer have to re type
in all those settings.

70
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.510
So this is really incredible, right?

71
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.962
Because now this is the very beginnings,
you know that there's a vimrc,

72
00:03:57.962 --> 00:04:02.250
you know it's something as simple as just
whatever commands I type into my command.

73
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.420
I can also put into my vimrc, and
it'll be automatically executed for me.

74
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.329
And that's at the beginning
of every vim startup.

75
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.940
So, this is just the beginning.

76
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.940
Hopefully the vmrc doesn't
feel that crazy right now.

77
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.530
Hopefully it feels actually pretty normal.

78
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.960
You're like, okay, I see it.

79
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.370
I can set some stuff.

80
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.850
It just gets sourced for me at some point.

81
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.330
It's kind of like a bashrc, right?

82
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.066
You don't really control when you do
a bashrc at some point in the process,

83
00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:32.845
it does it for you, and then you get
to have all your shortcuts or whatever.

84
00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:36.300
All right, so we're gonna keep on going.

85
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.430
One thing that I really dislike,
is how vim looked at that moment, right?

86
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.220
Because it just looks ugly.

87
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.440
I don't like eight spaces,
I don't like tabs.

88
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.670
I want four spaces, right?

89
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.040
That's what I want.

90
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.780
And so if I apply all these Settings,
I will get what I want.

91
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.213
And since you kinda have to look these up,
and find all the name of the settings,

92
00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:58.320
I just kinda provided them here for you.

93
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.840
But if you wanna know what they mean,
you could always use the help menu.

94
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.820
So let's look at the term, set expand tab.

95
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.040
What in the world does that mean?

96
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.949
So I can go help expand and
I can hit tab, and

97
00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.190
I'll show me a bunch of different
things that have expand in it.

98
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.170
And like none of these
are really the one I want.

99
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.080
So I can Exit out there,
and retry expand tab.

100
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.230
And when I hit Enter,
it'll take me to there.

101
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.204
And you'll see that in insert mode,

102
00:05:21.204 --> 00:05:24.880
use the appropriate number
of spaces to insert a tab.

103
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.050
Spaces are also used when you use the left
and right shifting of stuff, right?

104
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.620
You're like, okay, so expand tab simply
converts a tab character into spaces.

105
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.810
All right,
I now know what that setting means, right?

106
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.309
Now when you see set expand tab, you know
what it means that just doesn't seem like

107
00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:43.970
some magic setting, that eventually
makes all your system work correctly.

108
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.923
So you can do that with everything,
everything inside all of your set options,

109
00:05:47.923 --> 00:05:51.822
you can just do help that set option,
and you will get the editors definition.

110
00:05:51.822 --> 00:05:55.251
If that's not good enough, or
if it's written in kind of a goofy way,

111
00:05:55.251 --> 00:05:57.287
cause sometimes I read help options, and

112
00:05:57.287 --> 00:06:00.880
I don't really understand what
they're trying to tell me.

113
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.910
You can always Google it and some will
take a different stab at trying to make it

114
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.800
sound better, cause sometimes they'll use
terms that are like editor isms, right?

115
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.326
You have to understand
the nomenclature of the editor,

116
00:06:12.326 --> 00:06:14.489
to be able to understand
what you're reading.

117
00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:17.410
And that comes with time and experience.

118
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.980
But for the most part,
they're fairly comprehedable.

119
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.570
So I'm gonna take all these options that
I have right here, and I will copy them.

120
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.790
I'll put them over here in the chat,
just to make it easy.

121
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.090
Is there an online resources
that lists those settings?

122
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.121
I'll get there in just one second,
all right?

123
00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:33.540
So I pasted them all in the chat.

124
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.870
And let's go back, and go here.

125
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.250
And so, I'm gonna quit this file again.

126
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.840
And I'm gonna go back to my vimrc.

127
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.783
I'm just going to simply
press up on my shell,

128
00:06:43.783 --> 00:06:48.084
get my previous command history,
jump back in here, press Ctrl O,

129
00:06:48.084 --> 00:06:51.870
one line below and
then I'm gonna Ctrl Shift V for me.

130
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.182
So capital V, if you're on a terminal
usually that's how you have to paste in,

131
00:06:55.182 --> 00:06:55.980
so there we go.

132
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.720
Now, I have all those settings and
when I save this, it will now write it and

133
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.040
when I reopen up them,
all my weird indenting lows will be gone.

134
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.260
As you can see as I go down,
this looks better.

135
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.410
This looks more normal.

136
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.864
This probably looks like what most
people are used to seeing, when they see

137
00:07:14.864 --> 00:07:20.108
JavaScript, barring these bizarre bright
blue, the cyan, yellow and light purple.

138
00:07:20.108 --> 00:07:21.759
Like besides those colors,

139
00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:26.290
everything else looks pretty much
how you would expect it to look.

140
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.510
And so let's save it.

141
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.050
Let's go back we have it awesome,
this is kinda starting to feel better.

142
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.380
Quick recap though.

143
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.049
I know I mentioned this right before we
went down, we were combining motions and

144
00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:37.553
all that.

145
00:07:37.553 --> 00:07:39.918
So in case you forgot,
I'll do it really quickly or

146
00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.940
in case it feels a little
disjointed since the last time.

147
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.906
Let's just jump back up here,
I can walk back up there, or

148
00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:48.160
I could do it the new
way we've discovered.

149
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.732
I can type in a number 9k.

150
00:07:50.732 --> 00:07:52.500
I now have jumped up to the top.

151
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.130
I can do shift v and
do 6j, and I can do d.

152
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.270
Totally works.

153
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.190
I can do d6j, right?

154
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.840
We can combine these things
together to make them work.

155
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.203
Also fun little fact, I can do y 6 J, and
then now I can paste them all I want.

156
00:08:08.203 --> 00:08:12.712
Look at all look of that pasting
I just got done doing, right,

157
00:08:12.712 --> 00:08:15.555
cause I can now yank over a range.

158
00:08:15.555 --> 00:08:16.285
How cool is that?

159
00:08:16.285 --> 00:08:19.465
Let me undo by pressing you all of that.

160
00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:22.465
And so you can see that we can take
all these motions, and combine them.

161
00:08:22.465 --> 00:08:26.440
And here's the deal, is that right now
that probably feels a little weird to do,

162
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.825
I totally get that.

163
00:08:27.825 --> 00:08:31.105
But the more you use these motions,
the faster and faster you'll get.

164
00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:34.735
And there's also some pretty cool plugins,
specifically for niobium.

165
00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:36.750
It's actually just like a core feature.

166
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:41.410
You can highlight on yank meaning,
it will flash the region you yank.

167
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.560
So you can go, okay, I yanked that region.

168
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.274
It actually helps you kinda
comprehend your yanking and

169
00:08:46.274 --> 00:08:49.780
said going into visual mode first,
highlighting what you want.

170
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.464
And then yanking, you can get used to
using the yank motions instead of visual

171
00:08:53.464 --> 00:08:56.100
motions then yanking, it's pretty cool.

172
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.010
All right, so let's exit out of there.

173
00:08:59.010 --> 00:08:59.840
Let's go back here.

174
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.840
Let's look at this.

175
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.125
So a couple things before we move on,

176
00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:08.329
is you can always Google any options
like if you have problems with,

177
00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:12.418
say, your cursor going into a thin
cursor versus a fixed cursor.

178
00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:17.387
You can simply go and you could probably
Google like, hey, vim options cursor,

179
00:09:17.387 --> 00:09:19.735
and you'll probably get something.

180
00:09:19.735 --> 00:09:23.340
You could also go into vim,
and type in help options.

181
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.644
Now this, eventually as you scroll down,

182
00:09:25.644 --> 00:09:29.932
will literally have every single option
that is available all the way down, and

183
00:09:29.932 --> 00:09:34.028
it just keeps on going, keeps on going and
eventually some where deep down,

184
00:09:34.028 --> 00:09:37.240
look at that,
you can just see these things flying by.

185
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.410
I just saw something that said bomb.

186
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.350
That actually there you go.

187
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.660
I didn't even realize that there was,
I don't even know what this means, but

188
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.280
I'm sure as you see it, you'll see it.

189
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.050
A Boolean is default off, right?

190
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.344
You can go through, and look at all
these different things that actually

191
00:09:49.344 --> 00:09:51.790
exist within vim, and
every last one of them.

192
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.340
Now, honestly, this is pretty difficult,
cause there is a tonne of options.

193
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.980
If I go all the way down to
the bottom I say set number,

194
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.990
there's 7000 lines in this help document.

195
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.609
I doubt you're gonna read this
Stephen King novel, it'll be gripping but

196
00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:08.130
in the end, that's just way too
much context to hold in your head.

197
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.114
That's why honestly,
whenever I'm doing options setting or

198
00:10:11.114 --> 00:10:14.152
knowing what's available,
I usually either jump in here, and

199
00:10:14.152 --> 00:10:16.550
do a quick like file search
to see if I can find it.

200
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.963
If not, I just jumped on
Google try to see like, hey,

201
00:10:18.963 --> 00:10:21.680
is there some sort of option I'm missing?

202
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.119
It's very, very hard to have all
these in your head and honestly,

203
00:10:24.119 --> 00:10:26.110
I forget them all the time.

204
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.310
Completely normal, right?

205
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.630
It happens to everybody.

206
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.343
Another cool thing is that, I've showed
you this a few times you can tab complete

207
00:10:32.343 --> 00:10:35.260
options, but
there's also another available option.

208
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.070
So if I go like this, help expands tab,
remember how we couldn't quite get it.

209
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.490
If you press control D,
it'll actually show you a pop up menu.

210
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.240
And so
you can see everything that's available.

211
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.010
So you can actually look
through those one at a time.

212
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.149
And you see that the fourth
option down right here,

213
00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:52.330
sorry I'm bad at using a mouse.

214
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.815
Say's expand tab, so I can actually see
that and then I can go okay, expand,

215
00:10:56.815 --> 00:10:58.080
expand tab.

216
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.060
And you can see, all right,
I have all these options right here.

217
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.770
And so when I press tab,
I get the pop up menu.

218
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.307
When I press Ctrl D,
I get the kind of like the full,

219
00:11:06.307 --> 00:11:10.540
this is what we'd have autocompleted,
it's kind of a nice way to look at it.

220
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.732
And a fun fact when you're
inside of the tab menu,

221
00:11:13.732 --> 00:11:17.730
you can use Ctrl N to go forward,
or Ctrl P to go backwards.

222
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.767
You can also use tab, but
I got used to using Ctrl, P and N,

223
00:11:21.767 --> 00:11:27.124
because a lot of plugins also use Ctrl,
P and N to navigate these pop up menus,

224
00:11:27.124 --> 00:11:32.760
especially a lot of the autocompletes,
the lSPc, CLC conquer completion.

225
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:38.165
They all use very similar pop up menu,
s and they all require Ctrl P control N.

226
00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:40.063
You can use tab but ultimatel,

227
00:11:40.063 --> 00:11:44.790
y I just like to stick within kind
of like a pretty defined bounds.

228
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.470
It just operates vim
the same no matter what.

229
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.434
And so,
I like learning some of the isms, and

230
00:11:49.434 --> 00:11:51.790
that's one of them I have
gotten used to using.

231
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.430
That was a little bit.
