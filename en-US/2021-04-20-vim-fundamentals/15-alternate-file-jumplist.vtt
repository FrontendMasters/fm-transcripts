00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.180
Wow man marks I actually was so
excited when I first got these.

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.170
When I first found them out I thought
this is gonna be the greatest thing ever.

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.140
And then like a week into it, I'm like,
my mental overhead is just way too high.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.250
I like was breathing deeply at neck pain.

5
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.290
It was crazy.

6
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.710
Anyways, okay,
I didn't really have neck pain, come on.

7
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.660
So let's keep on going.

8
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.160
Let's kind of talk about
what we've done so far.

9
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.290
So we've used edit or
colon a you could also type in colon edit.

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.959
Showed how you can do a fuzzy find over
your root directory that you opened up and

11
00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:32.575
by using a bunch of stars,
there's a way for

12
00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:37.060
you to actually set an option to say
what your base finding pattern is.

13
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.229
And so that way e every single
time is a fuzzy find, but

14
00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:41.980
it's only an ok fuzzy find.

15
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.531
And I also showed you telescope, like
how much nicer telescope actually is, or

16
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:49.200
a fuzzy finder in general, and we're gonna
install a fuzzy finder here shortly.

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.996
I also showed you how to use Ctrl C or
Ctrl N, Ctrl P to navigate pop up menus,

18
00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:59.190
tab autocompletes, whereas Ctrl D will
show you all your possible options.

19
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.740
There's a lot here, but
let me show you a couple quick things.

20
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.520
These are like the fun things
now these I use all the time.

21
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.470
Alright, these are like staples.

22
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.800
Now here's the deal.

23
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.540
I made this edit last night
at like one in the morning.

24
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.947
So if I accidently mentioned this
elsewhere I'm gonna say sorry now but

25
00:01:16.947 --> 00:01:20.522
it felt like the right place to say,
like sometimes you get that feeling and

26
00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:21.820
this is the moment.

27
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.440
So here we go.

28
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.810
All right, so let's go back to this file.

29
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.902
So now I have those two marks set right,
I have tick capital A or

30
00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:34.410
sorry single quote capital A single
quote capital B, I can go between those.

31
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.365
Now there is something else.

32
00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:38.850
that is always available to you.

33
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.450
So the first thing I wanna do is I'm
gonna actually do registers, right?

34
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.936
And if you go all the way
down your registers,

35
00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:49.780
you'll notice these two right here,
the percent sign, and the pound sign.

36
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.615
The percent sign is my current file, it's
always that, remember when we did the so

37
00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.619
percent sign to source our vimrc,

38
00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.580
that's because it's always
pointing at your current file.

39
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.672
It is also stored in a register for
you automatically, but

40
00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:05.260
there is also the pound sign.

41
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.730
What does that pound sign?

42
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.280
What does it look like?

43
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.190
It looks like my previous file.

44
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.558
So it always stores one previous file,

45
00:02:13.558 --> 00:02:17.228
whatever your most recent previous
file is n the pound sign.

46
00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:21.783
And how you access it is Ctrl carrot now
I believe it works Ctrl six on Qwerty

47
00:02:21.783 --> 00:02:26.193
keyboards I can't tell you completely,
but I believe it's Ctrl six on

48
00:02:26.193 --> 00:02:29.930
Qwerty keyboards and
that should make the jump for you.

49
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.850
But I can press Ctrl carrot and
jump back and forth.

50
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.646
This is really nice when you're
doing like two file editing,

51
00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:39.200
you're in one file, you do some edits.

52
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.397
You take it you go and
you jump back to the other one.

53
00:02:41.397 --> 00:02:44.549
My goodness, I got it right, jump back
over here we go in here we make an edit,

54
00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.665
we write it, we jump back,

55
00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.979
and we're kind of like hopping back and
forth and doing these edits really fast.

56
00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:50.430
It actually is pretty nice.

57
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.144
As you can see right there did those two
edits really easily I could go back and

58
00:02:53.144 --> 00:02:54.370
forth between the files.

59
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.583
Alternate file also is available in ems.

60
00:02:56.583 --> 00:03:00.209
The less superior editor and
that one is it's the same notion and

61
00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.340
I know my co workers,
we talk about it all the time.

62
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.244
Alternate file is by far, one of
the most useful commands in any editor,

63
00:03:07.244 --> 00:03:11.250
just the ability to hop back and
forth really quickly, is super-duper.

64
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.060
I use it all the time for testing.

65
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.455
Like if I have a file that always breaks
and the follow up on the test file,

66
00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:20.390
you can just sit there going back and
forth and develop on it really quickly.

67
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.200
It's quite a nice feature.

68
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.220
And then the other thing I was
gonna show you is called jump list.

69
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.650
Now your jump list, it's unique,
it's fantastic, but it's weird.

70
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.830
Okay, so it's not quite file navigation
but it's also not not file navigation.

71
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.242
Alright, so
that's probably a little bit hard for

72
00:03:39.242 --> 00:03:42.437
that to make much sense but let me
show you the first thing you can do,

73
00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:46.138
you can always do help jump list right now
how the jump list effectively works is

74
00:03:46.138 --> 00:03:49.460
that there are some movement
commands that get added to it.

75
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.930
And there are file changes
that get added to it.

76
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.700
You can see all the things that actually
happened somewhere in this list.

77
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.520
I forget where it is.

78
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.580
It will tell you all about
which things get added.

79
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.400
I think it's under jumps, help jumps.

80
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.340
And it's right below it.

81
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.430
I thought, gosh, I can't even remember.

82
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.600
Anyways, you'll notice you see Ctrl I and
control O everywhere.

83
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.660
What this is,
is that's how you use your jump list.

84
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.880
So I can go like this colon jumps.

85
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.886
And you can see right here that as I go
down the empty spot marks where I'm at,

86
00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:23.630
or the globe or sorry,
the carrot marks where I'm at.

87
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.110
I don't know I said I'm spot there you go.

88
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.649
So if I want to jump backwards, I will
jump to twitch dot c back to my current

89
00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:33.678
file, twitch dot c back to my
current file, twitch dot c twice and

90
00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:38.070
then actually go all the way back
to vim nav playground directory.

91
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.670
So let's do that.

92
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.550
I'm going to go control O, O, O,
O, O, O, boom, right, there we go.

93
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.130
So I hopped back up my jump list.

94
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.610
And certain keys allow for that.

95
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.440
You can also use Ctrl I to go forward.

96
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.800
And so this can be very handy when
you're navigating a couple files.

97
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.166
But it can also be a little bit annoying
in the sense that if you have a bunch of

98
00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:01.610
movements that you use
that add to the jump list.

99
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.720
You'll watch yourself jump up and down.

100
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.339
I use it often to get back to where I was
in a file, like LGG to jump to the top,

101
00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.352
add an import statement really quickly,

102
00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:11.620
hit control low I'm right
back to where I was.

103
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.120
Right.
