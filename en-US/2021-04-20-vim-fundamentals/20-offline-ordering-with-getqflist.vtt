00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.268
So I was actually on the airplane coming
here and I really wanted the practice,

2
00:00:03.268 --> 00:00:05.470
the presentation, but I had a problem.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.780
I was on the airplane and
the site wouldn't load,

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.135
because I think there's an external
dependency on some sorta styling or

5
00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:13.760
something, and
it just looked all sorts of wonky.

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.770
So I thought, okay, I can just use
Vim to walk through my presentation.

7
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.130
I can do this, I'm an engineer,
I got this right?

8
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.380
I got fuzzy finders, I'll just do it,
this is not too hard.

9
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.870
So let me just show you
this really quickly.

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.690
This is where we're kind
of going off the rails.

11
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.340
I'm gonna try to write something
that's a little complex on the fly.

12
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.010
You never know it works
at least half the time.

13
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.820
Every single time.

14
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.480
Alright, cd, I think I called it
vim-fundamentals, there we go.

15
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.163
And when I was in here, I was like,
okay, so all I need to do,

16
00:00:44.163 --> 00:00:48.100
let's not do it here, let's go to
cd course-website, there we go.

17
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.577
All we are going to do is just
walk through my lessons, but

18
00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:54.470
then I start sitting and going, gosh, I
can't remember the order of these things.

19
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.500
What are the order of all these files?

20
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.007
I'm gonna have to remember the names for
them,

21
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:03.090
because they're not quite
named the right thing, right?

22
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.959
Alphabetical is not correct, because look,

23
00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:11.735
this one is border 15A, and
color my pencils is 10.

24
00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:14.856
My goodness, there's no way I'm
going to be able to do this, right?

25
00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:18.149
I'm going to have to search
through all this really manually.

26
00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.780
Well then I thought, wait a second, okay.

27
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.552
I am a scientist, sort of, I've sort
of considered myself a scientist,

28
00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:26.920
I quit Vim a few times, I could do this.

29
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.130
So I thought, alright, I'm gonna do grep
and I'm going to grep for order colon.

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.950
Looks pretty good, right?

31
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.400
And I'm going to do it for
everything under my lessons directory.

32
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.320
Start out md, all right, awesome.

33
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.490
We got 32 of them.

34
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.810
Yes, we're there.

35
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.410
So I can start walking them right?

36
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.720
I can walk them for okay, hold on.

37
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.230
Now they're still all the wrong order.

38
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.150
Why are they the wrong order?

39
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.650
So I'm gonna go copen, okay,

40
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.700
they alphabetized them
based on their file path.

41
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.310
Okay, so
I need a better way to do this right?

42
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.260
I need a way to do this a lot better.

43
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.680
If I were to alphabetize them on the order
string, well, there's a problem, right?

44
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.370
What's the problem?

45
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.690
String ordering of numbers is not the same
as natural ordering of numbers, right?

46
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.790
I'm gonna have one through 1 to 10,
to 20 to whatever, right?

47
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.130
It's gonna be that annoying
ordering that's not quite right.

48
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.432
So I thought okay,
we can do this, we got this,

49
00:02:22.432 --> 00:02:25.990
I have never done this before until I
was on an airplane with no internet.

50
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.380
So I was like, okay, I bet you there
is a way to get the quick fix list.

51
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.570
I am gonna type in getq and hit tab.

52
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.570
Yes, yes.

53
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.090
So we knew there is a good quick fix list.

54
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.290
I can get the quick fix list.

55
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.410
So I hit Enter, and let's just do this up,
hold on, I'm doing help.

56
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.180
Let's do getqfixlist.

57
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.313
What is it called?

58
00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:52.379
Getqfixlist, yeah, my goodness call

59
00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:58.326
getqfixlist am I not knowing how to type,
echo.

60
00:02:58.326 --> 00:02:59.000
There we go.

61
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.922
Echo getqfixlist, there it is.

62
00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:01.920
My goodness, there we go.

63
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.540
I'm like, so what's in here?

64
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.720
I've never looked at this
before we can totally do this.

65
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.380
Look, there's text with
that text order this.

66
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.979
All right, I can do this,
but I can't do it in Vim,

67
00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.608
because there's no way I can do this
in Vim off because I just don't have

68
00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:19.440
the superpowers with Vim
to be able to do this.

69
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.070
But I bet I could do it in Lua.

70
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.680
Well, I'm using Neovim so I can do this.

71
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.390
So then I thought, I'm gonna go Lua.

72
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.440
I'm gonna try to zoom this in so
you can see it here.

73
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.830
Let's get all that off the screen
too because it just makes it hard.

74
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.640
I think this is as zoom
in as I can zoom it in.

75
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.920
Alright.

76
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.240
So I went, alright,
we're gonna go set quick fix list, right?

77
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.280
But in Lua remember it's Vim function,
set, qfixlist.

78
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.060
You wouldn't know that right?

79
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.380
I said remember, but
you've actually never even heard of that.

80
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.810
I don't know why you would know that.

81
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.730
So we're gonna do vim.fn.sort, and

82
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.540
then I want to do vim.fn.getflist.

83
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.110
Yes.

84
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.200
Okay, so now I need to provide a function.

85
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.032
I have no idea how the source function
works, but I'm just gonna assume that

86
00:03:59.032 --> 00:04:01.480
works like every source function
I've ever seen in my lifetime.

87
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.420
I'm gonna say function a and b.

88
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.740
Yeah, that seems about right,
I'm gonna hit enter.

89
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.816
Okay.

90
00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:09.520
It said error.

91
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.070
Danm, I have to do it all in one line.

92
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.520
Okay, we're gonna do this all in one line,
here we go.

93
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.090
So I'm getting ready getting
ready to do this all in one line.

94
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.160
And how do we do this?

95
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.090
So I thought for
a second I went all right.

96
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.490
I bet I don't wanna do it this way,
so I didn't do it this way.

97
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.680
Instead, I went here and
I opened up a simple website.

98
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.930
I have to do the grep thing one more time,
grep up here, get all those.

99
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.710
Awesome.

100
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.102
And so what I did is I actually just
deleted one of these files really quickly,

101
00:04:38.102 --> 00:04:39.830
and I just typed it in myself.

102
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.700
So I did vim.fn.setqflist.

103
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.040
I was on an airplane It was fun right?

104
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.480
I'm now I'm just determined to do it.

105
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.469
I'm not practicing anymore,
I'm determined to make this thing work,

106
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.750
sort, and then vim.fn.getqflist.

107
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.704
And then I'm gonna go function a, b, and

108
00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:05.550
now I can go local a text equals a.text.

109
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.510
Yap.

110
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.300
And do it again with b.

111
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.719
So now I'm just writing Lua.

112
00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.076
I bet you I'm like, all right,
I bet I can do a num and

113
00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:18.527
I bet you it's a.text substring
starting at the 9th position,

114
00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:23.406
because remember Lau has one index and
is ordering O R D E R.

115
00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.913
Colon space quote, one indexing, right?

116
00:05:26.913 --> 00:05:29.890
Go to the next one, so there we go,
all right, awesome we're here.

117
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.048
And then I want to get the length of a
text and minus 2 because there's an A, and

118
00:05:34.048 --> 00:05:35.560
there's a quote at the end.

119
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.770
I'm like, alright, we got this.

120
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.250
We're totally going to get this.

121
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.837
So I took that, I take that, I replaced
the A's with B's, and I do GC for

122
00:05:43.837 --> 00:05:47.980
Do it globally all the way across
the line but asked me first.

123
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.670
No, yes, yes, yes.

124
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.500
Awesome.

125
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.110
Excellent.

126
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.790
And then I can remove the highlight search
with no highlight search, there we go.

127
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.016
Okay, so this is looking good.

128
00:05:56.016 --> 00:06:05.100
I'm gonna go if a_num is greater
than b_num, then return one.

129
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.722
And is like how you do it in Lua of
remember, I'm not in a Lua file, so

130
00:06:07.722 --> 00:06:09.310
I'm getting no highlighting.

131
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.280
I just need to get this done.

132
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.330
I'm freaking out here like how
am I ever going to present?

133
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.724
If I can't even write a little bit of Lua
on the fly, and my indenting is wrong,

134
00:06:15.724 --> 00:06:17.760
it's three spaces, it should be four.

135
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.531
Everything was going wrong
on the airplane, right?

136
00:06:19.531 --> 00:06:22.396
So I was like return negative one end.

137
00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:26.640
This should be it then I need to do two
of those awesome I can hop between them.

138
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.180
That's it and so then I did Lua file,
my current file.

139
00:06:31.818 --> 00:06:33.943
Okay, what just happened?

140
00:06:33.943 --> 00:06:38.573
Copen, ordering one a 10 went all
the way through now I must have done

141
00:06:38.573 --> 00:06:40.470
something wrong look at it.

142
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:46.220
It's like almost ordered but it's string
ordering but, of course, to number.

143
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.830
I bet you that's it,
two number, bet you that's it.

144
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.110
Save it, Luafile, did it,
copen 1, 2, 3, 4, blah blah blah.

145
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.127
Then I practice might, and then all I have
to do is just walk through my thing and

146
00:06:58.127 --> 00:07:00.210
I just practice it straight
through on the airplane.

147
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.050
This felt fantastic cuz I solved
a problem that was actually kinda hard.

148
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.680
To do because I didn't want to have to
walk through and try to find each one.

149
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.070
I probably spent way too
much time trying to fix it.

150
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.830
But nonetheless, like this is
the power that's available to you.

151
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.037
You can write plugins to edit and

152
00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:20.350
change a quick fix list to make
navigation the way you want it to be.

153
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.995
The reason why I wanna show you this
is just that right there should start

154
00:07:23.995 --> 00:07:25.160
sparking your ideas.

155
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.542
Like if I can get stuff into a quick
fix list, I could write it and

156
00:07:29.542 --> 00:07:34.172
do things I want with it to be more
useful for me, and I can even write

157
00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:39.350
a really awesome language like Lua,
which is a great embedded language.

158
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.336
It's not something I'd wanna write every
day but it's a great embedded language for

159
00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:45.169
the stuff and Holy cow, this is great.

160
00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:46.600
This is exactly what I wanted.

161
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.660
For me.
This was a really cool moment.

162
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.544
Because I was it was taking me three
