00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.210
Hey welcome everyone I hope that
everyone here is very excited about Vim.

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.519
I'm very excited about Vim, and

3
00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.710
I'm kind of known as someone that gets
a little yelling and screaming about vim.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.064
So I'll try to tone it down a little bit,
and

5
00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:15.580
help you guys get focused
up an awesome adventure.

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.878
So we're gonna kinda go
through this this day,

7
00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:21.770
hopefully we'll be able to stick to
most of this, we'll see how it goes.

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.167
We're gonna start with just some basic
introduction some hopefully some

9
00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:27.010
motivational material.

10
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.480
After that I'm gonna
go through the basics.

11
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.550
Now we're gonna start pretty basic, and

12
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.635
we're gonna move from there because I
don't know what level everyone's at, and

13
00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:38.100
it's best just to assume
the most basic and go forward.

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.590
Eventually we'll touch on the VimRC.

15
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.980
We'll touch on navigating files,
going through things, marks, etc.

16
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.218
We'll do some recapping some plugins,
some quick fix lists,

17
00:00:47.218 --> 00:00:51.940
some advanced tech manipulation, even
writing your first little bit of a plugin.

18
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.150
And eventually,
I will then just get on here and

19
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.400
pontificate about what I think
is the greatest way to use them.

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.408
That's kinda the ending, and so
when we're kinda going through this,

21
00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:05.760
you'll notice that my Vim looks ugly,
that the experience isn't that nice.

22
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.040
That's because we're
gonna start with nothing.

23
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.130
And we're gonna slowly
make it into something.

24
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.260
Now vim is not a batteries
included editor.

25
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.759
When you use VS code,
everything's included the open it up,

26
00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.280
looks really nice you click
around with your mouse.

27
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.993
Hopefully by the end of this,
you'll just take your mouse and

28
00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:24.980
gently placed in the garbage and
you'll never have to use it again.

29
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.170
And you'll be able to fly on your
keyboard and it'll be fantastic.

30
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.404
All right, so we're gonna go through this
if you don't know there is a Gatsby course

31
00:01:32.404 --> 00:01:36.470
I believe I'll be linking it here,
if you go there, you can follow along.

32
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.513
You don't necessarily have to follow along
any link that I'll be asking you to curl

33
00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:42.410
down and edit with Vim.

34
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.600
I will just be pasting in the chat, so
you don't have to worry a lot about that.

35
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.797
&gt;&gt; All right, so, like anything in life,

36
00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:54.980
a huge thing that affects our life
is always our small decisions.

37
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.034
You're gonna be presented with a few
large decisions in your lifetime,

38
00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:01.690
and those will greatly alter your life but
it's like a single moment.

39
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.438
But a lot of the things that
determine our destination,

40
00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:06.420
aren't those big moments, right?

41
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.104
And you can't control those big moments
you don't know when they're gonna happen,

42
00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:10.970
you don't know how they're gonna happen.

43
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.508
It's the little things that
really you can take control of,

44
00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:16.600
like something as simple as just
brushing your teeth every day.

45
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.593
Obviously, you're gonna
have great teeth health and

46
00:02:18.593 --> 00:02:21.900
you'll have reduced risk of heart attack
all these different things go into it.

47
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.130
Just by making really small decisions,
and there's I've been really hard.

48
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.192
Same with typing, if you practice if you
take it seriously, if you don't look at

49
00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:35.090
your keyboard, you'll get really good at
typing and your efficiency will go way up.

50
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.823
And that is something that you just
simply have to do day in and day out,

51
00:02:38.823 --> 00:02:42.640
and it's not like it's gonna
make you a better developer.

52
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.093
But you'll be, thinking less about typing,
you'll be thinking less about the thing

53
00:02:47.093 --> 00:02:50.590
you have to do, and
more about the thing you're doing.

54
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.510
And so it's just the little decisions, in
Vim is like one of those little decisions.

55
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.170
You simply have to commit to it,
you have to learn about it,

56
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.259
you have to practice each of
the little moves, and throughout time,

57
00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:04.810
it'll get better and better and better and
you'll get faster and faster and faster.

58
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.790
But Vim is kinda weird, right?

59
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.503
For those that haven't opened up Vim, if
you open up Vim, it probably feels arcane,

60
00:03:12.503 --> 00:03:16.010
esoteric, strange, and
then you don't know how to quit.

61
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.990
And then you become a meme that
exists all over the Internet and

62
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.470
you can't quit Vim and
we all laugh at you, right?

63
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.350
So it's a weird piece of software.

64
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.680
So I kinda wanted to show how did Vim get
started or what, was before VIM really?

65
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.987
So I'm gonna give you the most brief, and

66
00:03:31.987 --> 00:03:36.550
partially incorrect history
of how VIM got started.

67
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.210
So I'm gonna jump back over here.

68
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.000
And just for a moment,
I'm gonna open up a program called ED.

69
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.215
ED came before VIM,

70
00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:48.440
technically it was expert like I said
it's partially incorrect history of VIM.

71
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.862
So I'm just gonna open up a file.

72
00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.239
So let's find the file,
we can open up what the README,

73
00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.920
I'm gonna open up the readme with ed.

74
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.040
And when I do that, if I hit Enter,
it's gonna give me just a number.

75
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.720
So if you're a developer today,
how do you edit this file?

76
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.210
Anyone have an idea?

77
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.462
You probably don't, because I don't even
I'm not even sure I start hitting Enter,

78
00:04:07.462 --> 00:04:09.430
It starts saying question marks for me.

79
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.550
Like how did anyone develop anything
at some point in their lifetime on ed?

80
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.359
Well, it turns out a lot of the software,

81
00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.300
foundationally that was
developed was developed in this.

82
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.220
So you can actually start typing in like
line numbers, let me see number one, okay.

83
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.610
Then you can hit Enter, and
you can like walk through the file.

84
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.170
If I wanted to make say like,
I want to edit see,

85
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.220
let's just see what's on line 15.

86
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.326
Okay, so we wanna make an edit,

87
00:04:35.326 --> 00:04:40.490
I can type in s/ability,
and just say aboutily.

88
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.020
All right, there we go.

89
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.376
I've just changed the line, I am now
a programmer, I've used ed, right and

90
00:04:46.376 --> 00:04:50.196
there's some other ways you can edit
text and do things with ed, but

91
00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:52.760
this is how life was at one point, right?

92
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.720
I mean think about coming
from the punch cards.

93
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.420
How great is this from punch cards?

94
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.895
This is phenomenal.

95
00:04:57.895 --> 00:05:00.840
Right but for us this looks strange.

96
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.313
This is like I would never be able
to do anything effective in this,

97
00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:07.650
cuz I couldn't remember where
I was anything like that.

98
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.171
So to quit, you got to press quit then you
press quit again because I didn't save my

99
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:12.870
changes, or maybe I saved my changes.

100
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.770
I actually don't even know
what I just did there.

101
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.480
We'll just assume that
everything went well.

102
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.840
And so that's it.

103
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.942
I think overall,
that just feels too strange,

104
00:05:21.942 --> 00:05:26.907
I wouldn't recommend getting good at it,
you can, it'll be kind of like,

105
00:05:26.907 --> 00:05:32.830
hipster funny, but that's about as good
as it will be and so we'll move on.

106
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.850
So ed during that time, about 1974,
a guy named Bill Joy or 1976,

107
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.740
decided he's gonna write something
that's a little bit better.

108
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.797
And he writes visual mode,
which becomes known as VI.

109
00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:52.300
And VI is effectively
where VIM comes from.

110
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.847
And so he wrote this a long time ago,
back then,

111
00:05:54.847 --> 00:05:57.990
you couldn't get more
than 1K worth of RAM.

112
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.963
If you think about that, I think VS
code takes one terabyte of RAM or

113
00:06:00.963 --> 00:06:04.414
something like that, I'm not exactly
sure how many gigawatts it takes, but

114
00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:06.010
I know it's a lot of RAM.

115
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.456
And so imagine if you had,
effectively none,

116
00:06:08.456 --> 00:06:13.420
I don't even think you can spell
electron with 1k, it's very, very small.

117
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.501
And so he wrote VI, for
very small systems, and

118
00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:22.080
one of the hard parts is that Emacs during
that time costed hundreds of dollars.

119
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.927
So not only could you get emacs panky,

120
00:06:23.927 --> 00:06:27.630
you'd also have an editor whose
learning curve looks like this.

121
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.388
Very difficult but, you'd hopefully it
figured out eventually you couldn't

122
00:06:31.388 --> 00:06:34.540
differentiate it at any point cuz
it's just confusing out there.

123
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.752
But, you could pay hundreds of dollars for
emacs or you could use ed,

124
00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:41.630
bill made VI, things are looking good.

125
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.438
But then, when you start using VI,
you're like, wow, why is it H, J,

126
00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:46.630
K and L for movement?

127
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.324
Right?
I mean,

128
00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:51.850
if you're using Linux at all this is very
foundational, H, J, K and L is everywhere.

129
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.040
I think it's in Twitter, it's in Gmail,
so how did that get started?

130
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.427
Well, it turns out Bill Joy, may have been
the only person on earth that had this

131
00:06:59.427 --> 00:07:02.000
keyboard, but he had the keyboard.

132
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.310
H, J, K, L now had the arrow keys,
you I mean, it could have been was the.

133
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.860
But now it's H, J, K, L now and that's
just how life works, momentum, right?

134
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.380
And so Bill Joy, he did eventually quit
using vim and started using emacs.

135
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.210
And when he did that he kinda left us
with a little bit of words of wisdom.

136
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.638
And his words of wisdom of course was
people didn't know that VI was written for

137
00:07:24.638 --> 00:07:27.460
a world that doesn't exist anymore.

138
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.346
In other words, what he was trying to say
is that, VI was originally written so

139
00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:37.210
he could edit code at home, and
all he had was a 300 baud rate modem.

140
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.327
Now, I'm pretty sure that if you
looked in chat or anyone here,

141
00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:44.717
they most people probably don't even know
what a ,it's not a term we really use,

142
00:07:44.717 --> 00:07:47.380
it effectively just means bits per second.

143
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.544
So that means he had a 300 bit per second,
modem, a character usually takes about

144
00:07:52.544 --> 00:07:58.040
eight bits, back then they probably just
had ASCII 256 so it was just eight bits.

145
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.780
And that's all they had.

146
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.665
And so that means you could get 300
characters a second to come into

147
00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:03.610
your file.

148
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.957
So, it was written for
a world that was much, much different,

149
00:08:06.957 --> 00:08:09.990
today on this internet
that I'm here right now.

150
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.241
The internet that I'm using
right now is technically,

151
00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:16.640
3.3 million times faster,
than what he wrote VI four.

152
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.254
So it's, life's improved a little bit but,

153
00:08:19.254 --> 00:08:22.671
here's the deal is that just
because a world that existed and

154
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:27.840
you wrote a tool for that world doesn't
mean it's not applicable still today.

155
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.729
And vi has gone through a lot of changes,

156
00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:33.176
it went from vi to an editor called
Stevie in which nobody knows about, and

157
00:08:33.176 --> 00:08:37.290
I'm not even sure how to get to an editor
called vim, which was based on Stevie.

158
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.405
And eventually vi was open sourced,
but vi was long since deprecated, and

159
00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:43.780
then became the de facto standard.

160
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.709
Vim was also written
by guy's name is Bram,

161
00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:49.410
it's been contribute to a whole bunch.

162
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.100
It's really picked up steam in the last
few years as somehow a comeback editor

163
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.941
because people are just really
realizing how effective and

164
00:08:55.941 --> 00:08:57.750
how awesome it actually is.

165
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.885
And so, I'm here today and
hopefully we can kinda take that, and

166
00:09:00.885 --> 00:09:05.110
make it into something and everyone can at
least leave here knowing what's available.
