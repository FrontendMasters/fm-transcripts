00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.531
So anyways, here's my favorite one,
which for a long time, I hate it,

2
00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:06.641
I actually thought this was by
far the worst form of navigation.

3
00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:11.272
I'm on YouTube multiple times saying how
disorienting it is, but I got used to it,

4
00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:15.394
I just finally went, that's it I'm
committed, I'm committing here.

5
00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:18.167
We're gonna do this and so it's Ctrl d and

6
00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:23.090
Ctrl u Ctrl D will jump down by a half
page, Ctrl U will jump up by half page.

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.578
If you didn't notice when
I close this reopen it,

8
00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:27.779
when I jump back down
here I just did Ctrl DD.

9
00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.557
A couple times landed right where we
needed to be and kind of picked up

10
00:00:31.557 --> 00:00:35.150
from there, so I use this because
it is a very predictable jump.

11
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.782
Once you can quick getting disoriented
by that quick code jump, and

12
00:00:39.782 --> 00:00:41.743
you kind of start to feel it.

13
00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:44.752
And it becomes more normal,
then it's super predictable,

14
00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:46.760
right exactly what's going to happen.

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.740
The thing that's below your cursor
will now be above your cursor, right?

16
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.390
And so it's okay,
I see how this thing works, right okay,

17
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.470
that's really easy actually
It's not that bad.

18
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.296
I'd say that in this one for
me has what I refer to as appear benefit,

19
00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:03.750
other than if you're too zoomed in.

20
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.882
Now for everybody here,
I zoom in pretty heavily,

21
00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:08.920
which means I'm literally jumping
nine lines of code at a time, right?

22
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.836
If you're super zoomed out and
you'd like to read like super small code,

23
00:01:12.836 --> 00:01:16.000
when I'm jumping right
now by 40 lines of code.

24
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.960
So it can become very large
jumping at that point, so

25
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.530
it is unfortunately
tied to your viewpoint.

26
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.796
There is also like I believe it's b and
e yeah, b and e i think jumped half pages,

27
00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:31.170
quarter pages I can't remember,
I don't ever use them.

28
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.010
Whenever they're another form of jumping,
I've never really gotten it meant to them.

29
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.220
Here's another one that's pretty neat
is bracket m and bracket capital M.

30
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.650
Effectively if I do closing bracket M,
it'll jump to the next opening squirrely

31
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.920
brace, this is really nice for
C style languages, right?

32
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.829
I can just jump,
did it all the way to the closing and

33
00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.010
then I can go the back way
I can just jump back up.

34
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.625
I have yet
to really get used to using this,

35
00:01:56.625 --> 00:02:01.795
I don't really just because I find Ctrl +
D to almost always fit my use case, right?

36
00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:06.340
Because I don't really read code and
have to hop down block by block.

37
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.359
But it is something that's there and I
know a lot of people actually find this to

38
00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:10.980
be one of the preferred ways to navigate.

39
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.054
Not for me, but you can try it out and
you can see it like it also,

40
00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:18.600
the key combo of brackets can be really
uncomfortable on some people's keyboards.

41
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.484
But there is a plugin by a person named
t Pope, the father of Vim plugins.

42
00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:27.566
And he has a bunch of these that will
actually map to other things within Vim.

43
00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:31.889
That makes it so that this becomes a more
consistent way you navigate in vim so,

44
00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.865
it's not the worst, I believe it.

45
00:02:33.865 --> 00:02:37.611
He also has a for a quick fix list so,
you can do like bracket q so

46
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:39.500
it feels the same way, right?

47
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.407
If you start to feel, like Vim operates
the same all the time for me, just not for

48
00:02:44.407 --> 00:02:46.690
me, I make a quick fix list to J and K.

49
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.678
I just do things a little bit differently,

50
00:02:49.678 --> 00:02:54.810
but you get the general idea all right,
one more this, I love this one.

51
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.760
This one became one of my favorite ones
of all time because it's just this thing

52
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.110
that's so magical.

53
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.082
It's also probably a little weird for
a lot of people to see someone so

54
00:03:04.082 --> 00:03:06.410
excited about an editor but
think about it.

55
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.934
This same excitement that's
in me could be a new as well,

56
00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:11.790
right you don't even know how
exciting it is once you can use it.

57
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.130
When you're on a pair,

58
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.883
meaning notice that right away
when I'm on this squirrely brace.

59
00:03:16.883 --> 00:03:19.082
Look all the way at
the bottom right there,

60
00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:23.130
it put a little underline right it's
able to pair up brackets really quickly.

61
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.660
And when I press percent sign, it will
jump between brack l jump between pairs.

62
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.786
It does not work with text, but it works
with brackets, squirrely braces, and

63
00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:35.710
parentheses and so it's very nice.

64
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.959
So if you wanted to jump between
something, you can just do it and

65
00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.570
one of my favorite motions of all time.

66
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.726
Even though it's completely and
absolutely not the fastest way to do it,

67
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.550
It's shift v,
f score Li percent sign D, right?

68
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.452
I can just delete that block by doing that
by doing a shift v jumping to the end,

69
00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:59.750
jump to the matching, delete those lines,
It just feels super cool to do, right?

70
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.690
It's not the most efficient, but it just
feels Incredible, I don't know why it is I

71
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.430
just get so excited about these things,
and you can do it right in here, right?

72
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.942
So I could do the exact same thing right
here, I could just jump between them and

73
00:04:10.942 --> 00:04:12.300
just delete this right?

74
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.275
We shift v, there we go, I was able just
to delete out that array really quickly,

75
00:04:16.275 --> 00:04:17.690
which makes it really nice.

76
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.033
I could have done a looking right here,

77
00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:23.600
that's a four down there I
could have done d4j right?

78
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.573
That would have worked, just not as
convenient I don't think I think

79
00:04:28.573 --> 00:04:33.130
that those kind of things just feel so
cool to do, just so neat.

80
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.658
I don't know why it's just so
awesome to justice all right, so

81
00:04:36.658 --> 00:04:39.530
we're going to get a little
bit zany now all right.

82
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.550
Let's think about the ways
we can delete this,

83
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.460
now one thing we could do is
what I showed you the shift.

84
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.923
I've kind of jumped ahead a little
bit because I'm just kind of zoom in

85
00:04:49.923 --> 00:04:51.200
a little bit faster.

86
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.928
This is more of the educational one I
thought we were gonna all walk through

87
00:04:53.928 --> 00:04:56.437
this and do this but now that I know
that we're five hours into this.

88
00:04:56.437 --> 00:04:59.937
Everyone's probably not necessarily
following along as deeply, so

89
00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:01.400
I'll just show you it.

90
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.715
So we could do the highlighting,
the deleting,

91
00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:05.865
like I showed you we
could have done the d6j.

92
00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:10.194
We could have done that,
we could have done a shift v 6j down,

93
00:05:10.194 --> 00:05:12.460
then just simply hit d, right?

94
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.387
There's a lot of options to kind of
go through all here, we could use c

95
00:05:16.387 --> 00:05:20.680
instead of that, but we can spice it
up a little bit more and let's do that.

96
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.520
Let's go down a little bit just a little
bit I want to delete all of this well,

97
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.190
I could use all those offsets and
all that or I could do this D.

98
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:39.053
Obviously, that's not D that's i d i
squirrely brace,now by doing that,

99
00:05:39.053 --> 00:05:45.000
I've deleted the insides of
the matching squirrely brace come on.

100
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.615
Tell me that's not awesome,
that is awesome right, and

101
00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:52.831
it works with all sorts of pairs It
is fantastic idea I get in there,

102
00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:55.360
It also works with ci, look at that.

103
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.895
I just deleted everything, I'm in
insert mode and I am properly indented,

104
00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:00.730
ready to fly, that is just fantastic.

105
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.040
I can yank the inside of it
right now I'm pasting right,

106
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.092
I'm able to paste right in there.

107
00:06:06.092 --> 00:06:11.438
I can also do things like this I can vi
the insides right there I already have it,

108
00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:13.384
this is fantastic, right?

109
00:06:13.384 --> 00:06:19.008
But what's the problem well,
I'm not getting on the outsides,

110
00:06:19.008 --> 00:06:23.914
what letter do you think I have
to press to be able to delete

111
00:06:23.914 --> 00:06:27.100
also the containing, pairs right?

112
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.174
So if I did DI brace, deletes the insides,
what deletes the outsides,

113
00:06:30.174 --> 00:06:32.084
you can just say it and
chat If you're here.

114
00:06:32.084 --> 00:06:35.281
If you're feeling fast,
if they're telling me the truth,

115
00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:37.940
you're only five seconds away, come on.

116
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.259
Tell me what would, if I's the insides,
what is the outside or

117
00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.750
web or zoom, you can just say
the letter A, yes, it is totally A.

118
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.578
So if you go da squirrely,
you'll delete the score release as well,

119
00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:55.400
which means that if you did va squirrely,
you now have everything highlighted.

120
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.356
Then I can do a shift v to convert my
visual mode into visual line mode and

121
00:07:00.356 --> 00:07:02.970
I have the whole block highlighted.

122
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.409
One thing that's really awesome is that
sometimes you're not at the start of

123
00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:08.400
a function.

124
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.169
So that's super cool V,
do that doing that It doesn't

125
00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:14.070
really work because I am not
at the start of the function.

126
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.688
So instead I can do va squirrly,
shift v go into that and

127
00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:21.640
there, bow down delete it,
It's fantastic, right?

128
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.294
And we'll show you one more thing, but

129
00:07:23.294 --> 00:07:26.420
you can't tell anybody because this
is too cool okay, so let's do this.

130
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.932
We're now here we now have highlighted
both the squirrely braces and

131
00:07:31.932 --> 00:07:34.280
the contents on the inside.

132
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.540
If you press O, you can jump
between your visual selection,

133
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.470
how cool is that so
I can go into line mode kit.

134
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.806
I can go up a little bit hit
go down a little bit perfect,

135
00:07:47.806 --> 00:07:54.900
we have now deleted it, just get the whole
thing It's just too dang awesome, right?

136
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.652
Here's that part I just I don't know,
I just think that's super exciting to me

137
00:07:58.652 --> 00:08:01.630
that's just the most exciting
thing ever to be able to do this.

138
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.473
No, I'm getting funny looks from people
but this is just the best way for

139
00:08:05.473 --> 00:08:06.190
me to do it.

140
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.537
So I want to take what's inside this
squirrely bait or this if statement and

141
00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:12.614
put it into the other if statement.

142
00:08:12.614 --> 00:08:17.633
So I can why I squirrely just did that
I can jump down by 10 going here I

143
00:08:17.633 --> 00:08:23.730
can vi squirrely brace highlight
everything in there and paste it right in.

144
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:28.384
So I just yanked from one contiguous
section relative jumped into another one,

145
00:08:28.384 --> 00:08:29.500
paste it right in.

146
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.469
So as you can see,
the more familiar you become with them,

147
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:36.570
the more amazing these motions get.

148
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.966
And I'm not even sure if I put this last
one, I didn't even put this last one in,

149
00:08:39.966 --> 00:08:42.070
but I do and
I've been using it a lot, all right.

150
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:47.112
So sometimes, you'll see that I want
to highlight some part of the line but

151
00:08:47.112 --> 00:08:48.559
not the whole thing.

152
00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:53.303
Especially if the if anyone out there
write C++, every C++ function looks class.

153
00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:55.755
And then a whole bunch of stuff and

154
00:08:55.755 --> 00:09:01.636
then everything is just everything
just there's colons everywhere, right?

155
00:09:01.636 --> 00:09:07.433
And you want to be able to say highlight
something, the whole thing and

156
00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:12.850
just replace it, so there's capital W,
so exciting here we go.

157
00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.931
So there's remember the VI
how we can highlight or YI or

158
00:09:17.931 --> 00:09:25.120
di we delete the insides of If I'm in
the middle of a word, I can go di.

159
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.816
I just see, let's see di, little w, I
just deleted from the inside of the word,

160
00:09:29.816 --> 00:09:31.347
that's pretty awesome.

161
00:09:31.347 --> 00:09:36.011
Which means you can also if you're
in the middle, you can vi W,

162
00:09:36.011 --> 00:09:41.570
you can highlight from within the word,
It also works with ci W, awesome.

163
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.078
We're ready to go right It works
with everything that about but

164
00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:47.538
sometimes you want to
not only do your word.

165
00:09:47.538 --> 00:09:52.470
But really you want to do everything
that doesn't have whitespace, right?.

166
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.876
You want to do the whole word not just
simply whatever is the tokens that

167
00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:56.750
separate words.

168
00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.902
So you can do v i capital W,
no, actually highlight,

169
00:10:00.902 --> 00:10:06.940
everything that is non whitespace
non contiguous whitespace, right?

170
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.114
And so that makes it so
that if there's a word you have and

171
00:10:09.114 --> 00:10:10.932
you need to just move it
down into another one.

172
00:10:10.932 --> 00:10:14.211
I can highlight it do that and
then say I move it somewhere else and

173
00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:17.830
vi word paste right,
I can just replace that word right there.

174
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.899
It's really fantastic I can why I capital
W juicy yank that whole thing and

175
00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.210
now I just have it, I'm ready to yank it.

176
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.928
I use this actually more and

177
00:10:25.928 --> 00:10:29.448
more it's surprising how often
I use yank by capital W.

178
00:10:29.448 --> 00:10:34.443
Or visually select by capital W to
replace it with something that I have

179
00:10:34.443 --> 00:10:36.060
inside my registers.
