1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.603
All right, so we've now learned how
to move around inside of NETRW.

2
00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:05.299
It's pretty nice, right?

3
00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.478
We did a little bonus extra learning
with some window movements, fantastic.

4
00:00:09.478 --> 00:00:15.402
But honestly if you wanted to explore,
do you think you'd want to press :Vex

5
00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:21.700
every single time to open up a file
explorer every time you wanted to do it.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.269
My guess is no,
no you would not, no, and why?

7
00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.173
Because it's inconvenient,
it would be a lot of typing,

8
00:00:30.173 --> 00:00:34.260
it's five characters just
to open up a file explorer.

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.530
So, if only there was a way
that this could be easier,

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.396
if only a way we could shorten it up and
make it the way we want it.

11
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:45.270
Wait, we can, it's vim, right?.

12
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.890
So let's jump back and
let's all open up our vimrc together.

13
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.135
Now this is where it's gonna get
a little bit goofy, but bear with me,

14
00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:54.730
it pretty fun, it's pretty fun.

15
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.580
This is where you really
start to take control of vim.

16
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.610
And this moment right here is gonna
help you use plugins, it's gonna help

17
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.760
you personalize vim, it's gonna help you
do a bunch of things that you want to do.

18
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.607
And you really should get into this
mentality where every time something feels

19
00:01:11.607 --> 00:01:15.803
inconvenient or you don't like it,
you make it the way you want it.

20
00:01:15.803 --> 00:01:18.280
All right, so let's go all the way down.

21
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.689
Remember, you can just press g to go all
the way down to the bottom, or you can

22
00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.520
press j a whole bunch, or I guess I could
have pressed 8j gone all the way down.

23
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.250
Let's press o to insert a new line,
hit an extra enter.

24
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.600
There we go, we're rocking.

25
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.900
And now I'm gonna type in a couple items.

26
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.610
And this is gonna get a little confusing
for a second, but I'll explain them.

27
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.298
The first thing I'm gonna do is
called a mapleader, all right.

28
00:01:37.298 --> 00:01:39.790
And I'm gonna just set
that to a blank space.

29
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.310
The next thing I'm going to
do is going to be a remap.

30
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.675
I'm gonna go nnoremap.

31
00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:51.129
And I'm gonna go &lt;leader&gt;pv :Vex&lt;CR.

32
00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:54.002
Now that is a lot of stuff I just
got done typing all at once, and

33
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:56.730
you're probably thinking,
okay, what are these mean?

34
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.368
You might be able to start guessing
what they kind of mean, but

35
00:01:59.368 --> 00:02:01.260
let's go over it one at a time.

36
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.350
So first, what is a mapleader?

37
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.424
A mapleader effectively
is you telling them, hey,

38
00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:10.755
I have a special key I
would like to press and

39
00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:14.939
from henceforth it shall
be known as leader, right?

40
00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.757
That means if there's plugins that say,
hey,

41
00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:22.620
we'll provide you some easy movements by
pressing leader k, it will just work for

42
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.664
you because you've set that key,
the leader key.

43
00:02:25.664 --> 00:02:29.150
And so
I've defined the leader key as a space.

44
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.268
So meaning when I press space,
I am now pressing the leader key.

45
00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:37.450
And that means when I use it in
remaps it will be known as that.

46
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.970
So it's kinda like a way to name a key and
it can be whatever key you want.

47
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.050
So let's break down this line.

48
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.120
This line was particularly confusing,
and honestly, I'd even read for

49
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.730
like five minutes to figure
out what this line meant.

50
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.380
I just knew that that's what you did and
you copied and pasted all over the place.

51
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.450
So let me kind of explain
this a little bit more.

52
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.030
There's actually four parts to this.

53
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.550
And so
I'm gonna break it up in that sense.

54
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.690
And these two kind of go together.

55
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.160
So, first, what does the first n mean?

56
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.140
Well, the first n means
the mode you're in.

57
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.065
That means I could have used i,
I could have used v for

58
00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:16.890
visual mode, i for insert,
c for command, t for terminal.

59
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.358
There's a couple other ones, but for
now we're just gonna focus on n, v and i,

60
00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:25.440
n being normal mode or the mode
you're in where you can move around.

61
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.660
So that means I'm saying,
hey, it's on this mode.

62
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.480
Next, this nore, this nore is
actually pretty straightforward.

63
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.200
It means no recursive
execution is how I look at it.

64
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.470
That's how I say it in my head or nore.

65
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.735
Effectively what it means is that if
you don't include this, if we were

66
00:03:42.735 --> 00:03:49.350
to remove that part, your remap,
the other side, could execute more remaps.

67
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.310
Now that may sound a little bit confusing,
but it can totally do that.

68
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.390
And I'll show you here in one moment.

69
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.361
This last part, map is just saying,
hey, it's a map command.

70
00:03:57.361 --> 00:04:00.639
Then leader is a space for me,
it could be whatever key you want,

71
00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.280
I would highly recommend
getting used to space.

72
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.390
Some people use commas, there's
a reason why I don't like using commas.

73
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.279
Use space, use whatever.

74
00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:09.530
And then I do pv.

75
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.710
I just chose two letters at random,
project view.

76
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.680
I want to do project view when
I wanna see my file tree.

77
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.430
So I'm gonna go space pv
to see the file tree.

78
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.720
And this is called the left hand side,

79
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.010
this thing right here is
called the left hand side.

80
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.356
This is the set of keys
I'm gonna press to remap.

81
00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:28.863
The right hand side or

82
00:04:28.863 --> 00:04:34.320
this side is what will be executed
when the left hand side is typed.

83
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.119
That means I can replace anything,
if I don't like p pasting,

84
00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:40.560
I can make p do what I want it to do.

85
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.680
Don't recommend it, but you can.

86
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.420
So, let's look at this.

87
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.430
So on the right hand side,
I'm gonna go from normal mode.

88
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.920
Remember, we're in normal mode,
I'm gonna go into command mode.

89
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.660
I'm going to type in Vex.

90
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.041
And then remember, as I said in
the beginning in the abbreviation section,

91
00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:58.040
cr is enter.

92
00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.190
So I'm gonna execute an enter.

93
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.830
So I'm literally just gonna type
the command in and press enter.

94
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.480
So, let's test it out.

95
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.065
Let's see how this feels.

96
00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:08.350
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna source this file.

97
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.993
So to source this file,

98
00:05:09.993 --> 00:05:15.240
everyone should be able to do this
type in :so stands for source, and %.

99
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.280
Percent sign is a shorthand for
saying, my current buffers file.

100
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.190
So I'm gonna hit enter.

101
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.920
So there we go, we have sourced this file,
we've re executed our vimrc and

102
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.410
now I should be able to press leader pv.

103
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.560
All right, it's open,
just opens right for me.

104
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.310
It's exactly the thing I want to do.

105
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.439
It's a lot easier than typing Vex.

106
00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.168
I can type it super fast cuz I'm very,

107
00:05:38.168 --> 00:05:41.373
very used to it as opposed to five
characters it's three characters.

108
00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:44.188
Three characters is like the maximum
optimal length for a remap,

109
00:05:44.188 --> 00:05:48.040
anything beyond that, it gets really hard
to build up that fast muscle memory.

110
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.980
But that is like a really nice
kind of way to go about things.

111
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.480
Now you can choose whatever
makes sense for you.

112
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.980
You can have leader t, why not?

113
00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.620
It's yours, don't tell me how to
let you live your life, right?

114
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.800
But, there are some things that
are little bit dangerous about remaps.

115
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.110
So I'm gonna do something
that's kinda fun.

116
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.920
But before we do that, let's look
at what recursive execution means.

117
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.141
So what I'm gonna do is I'm actually
gonna delete out the nore and I'm gonna

118
00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:21.700
delete the rest of this and I'm gonna
type in, let's do xx, we'll remap to yy.

119
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.070
And let's do that in insert mode, right?

120
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.137
And then I'm gonna copy this and
I'm gonna say that y equals zz.

121
00:06:32.137 --> 00:06:36.410
And I'm gonna say that z equals aa.

122
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.020
So when I press xx,
it's going to remap it to be yy.

123
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.070
And when I press y,
it's gonna remap it to be zz.

124
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.980
And when I press z, it's gonna be aa.

125
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.210
So let's source it, oopsies,
let's source it right now.

126
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.270
So now that I've sourced it, here's one
thing that's kind of weird is since I've

127
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.040
already sourced a file with leader pv,
it still works, leader pv still works

128
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.240
because it's still there cuz we haven't
restarted vim but it's no longer in there.

129
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.779
So remember, as you execute, whatever
commands you execute, stay alive for

130
00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:08.970
the life of your vim unless
if you replace them.

131
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.880
So now if I go into normal mode or
insert mode, which I'm here,

132
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.492
if I press y it does aaaa,
cuz it did two z's and

133
00:07:17.492 --> 00:07:21.145
z's were recursively executed into a's.

134
00:07:21.145 --> 00:07:25.775
If I do xx, it does all that,
it does all these a's, right?

135
00:07:25.775 --> 00:07:30.071
But also notice something different, when
I press x, it appears after my cursor for

136
00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:31.475
a moment, do you see that?

137
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.730
That's because vim is allowing you
to have a moment to do the remap.

138
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.576
You may have remaps, it needs to do so,
it doesn't want to interrupt you, but

139
00:07:41.576 --> 00:07:44.920
it gives you only a fraction amount
of time like a part of a seconds.

140
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.810
So first I'm gonna erase
this cuz that's just.

141
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.770
Don't actually do that to yourself that
seems like really inconvenient, right?

142
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.830
I'm gonna go nore right here.

143
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.750
There we go, we're back to normal.

144
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.355
I'm going to close down vim for
a quick second, reopen up so

145
00:07:57.355 --> 00:08:01.536
I no longer have that weird x, y,
z, a thing that was going on there,

146
00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:06.210
and I'm gonna look at these and
we're gonna try something different.

147
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.610
I'm gonna yank, right, so
I just yanked a line right there.

148
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.380
Now I'm going to paste it,
I can totally paste it right.

149
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.050
Well let's just say I use
space to move forward.

150
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.600
Watch what happens when I press space.

151
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.800
Do you see that lag?

152
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.157
Why does it lag?

153
00:08:21.157 --> 00:08:24.940
It's because my leader
key is the space bar.

154
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.565
It's giving me a brief moment to
execute a command as opposed to do its

155
00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:34.772
original command, its default command
which is to move over to the left one.

156
00:08:34.772 --> 00:08:36.433
Space is equivalent to l.

157
00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.995
l and space do the same thing,
the only difference is,

158
00:08:39.995 --> 00:08:42.013
is that space is my leader key.

159
00:08:42.013 --> 00:08:44.869
So it's gonna take a moment
to actually execute,

160
00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:48.110
which means that if I did
space p it would first go up.

161
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.710
Is it gonna do v, is it gonna do it?

162
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.390
No it didn't.

163
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.330
I'm gonna move over 1 and
then I'm gonna paste, right.

164
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.000
So I did the original command,
but it gave me time to press v.

165
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.485
So there's always a little bit of risk.

166
00:08:59.485 --> 00:09:03.916
And if you don't type fast enough with
these type of remap, especially on p,

167
00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:08.349
because you will end up pasting content
you didn't mean to if you're too slow

168
00:09:08.349 --> 00:09:09.116
to execute.

169
00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:13.769
Or something that's even worse, if you
remap something that looks like this,

170
00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:16.470
just pv to go into it, let me source this.

171
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.520
When I go to try to paste something,
I'll go paste.

172
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.600
Okay, there it is.

173
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.250
Wow, that took way too long.

174
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:27.211
It's because I remapped p which is
the paste button to do something else, but

175
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:29.600
only part of the paste button.

176
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.168
So remaps can be both awesome and

177
00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:34.080
you could accidentally
shoot yourself in the foot.

178
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.180
So, be thoughtful.

179
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.648
That's why I always have a leader key or
a control or something that's a little bit

180
00:09:40.648 --> 00:09:43.580
unique for me to press to be
able to start the process.

181
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.480
Like I don't navigate with space bar.

182
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.717
If you navigate with space bar,
that's crazy, right,

183
00:09:48.717 --> 00:09:52.562
like that's way too inefficient,
just I'm gonna walk over here,

184
00:09:52.562 --> 00:09:54.653
like you would never want to do that,

185
00:09:54.653 --> 00:09:59.117
instead you want to be able to move fast
as possible, so that's why I chose it.

186
00:09:59.117 --> 00:10:01.431
Hopefully everyone liked
this little moment.

187
00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:03.730
Hopefully it demystified kind
of how these remaps work.

188
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.721
Cuz honestly, there's just
a lot of questions that go on.

189
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:09.450
A lot of people don't
realize how simple yet

190
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.526
how dangerous these things can
be if you don't understand them.

191
00:10:13.526 --> 00:10:15.169
All right, awesome.

192
00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:18.203
So hopefully the people in the chat and
the Zoom call there are a little bit more

193
00:10:18.203 --> 00:10:21.613
experienced, just learned something during
all this, they're starting to get some

194
00:10:21.613 --> 00:10:24.370
momentum here,
things are getting a bit more complicated.

195
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.770
Which is ultimately what we want to do.

196
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.510
So we're gonna make some edits to our
vimrc, and we're gonna be coding.

197
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.650
Now what you don't wanna have to do
every single time is that, all right,

198
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.484
I've made some edits to my vimrc,
I'm gonna quit, I'm gonna reopen up vim.

199
00:10:38.484 --> 00:10:40.020
Yay, everything's working.

200
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.390
So let's add one more remap.

201
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.800
Now hopefully, here shortly when I say
these things, you're gonna be like remap.

202
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.750
Awesome, but for now, I'm gonna keep
queuing you until it gets into your brain.

203
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.230
So I'm gonna go all the way down.

204
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.589
I'm gonna copy, I'm gonna paste it.

205
00:10:52.589 --> 00:10:55.190
My goodness,
see I forgot to take out that leader key.

206
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.110
Look how slow that is,
it's painfully slow.

207
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.800
So let me get rid of all this.

208
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.790
Let me put in the leader, right.

209
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.441
And now I actually do
have to I don't know,

210
00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:08.060
I'm gonna reset it just because
p was already being used.

211
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.410
I'm gonna take this, I'm gonna paste it,
and I'm gonna make something from me.

212
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.784
I'm gonna go, every time I press
leader CR, as in leader enter or

213
00:11:17.784 --> 00:11:21.691
space enter for me,
I am going to go shout out and

214
00:11:21.691 --> 00:11:26.135
then I'm just gonna go
straight to my vimrc, right?

215
00:11:26.135 --> 00:11:30.760
fig/nvim/init.vim, there we go.

216
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:36.850
So every single time I press leader enter,
I'm gonna source my vimrc.

217
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.059
So right now, if I try to do it
right now notice nothing happens,

218
00:11:40.059 --> 00:11:41.690
cuz I haven't sourced it yet.

219
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.500
So let's source it, oopsies,
let's source it that one last time.

220
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.700
Shout out %, as I always say in my head.

221
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.218
Now when I press space enter,

222
00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:52.580
notice what it says right into
my command bar right there.

223
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.730
It says so and
the path to my init.vim, there we go.

224
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.620
I just made something go
to my init.vim and do it.

225
00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:06.010
So that means if I add something else,
let's go imap x yy.

226
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.710
If do that,
I can go space enter and press x.

227
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.790
And it should, my goodness,
why didn't that work?

228
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.620
Hey now, did I forgot to save you?

229
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.350
I think it's cuz I forgot to save you,
there you go.

230
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.670
I did actually just forget to save.

231
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.820
There we go, awesome.

232
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.810
I can now just source it without having
to leave or manually type it in or

233
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.910
be in my vimrc and use the percent sign.

234
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.600
I can just press two buttons and
have it all sourced for me.

235
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.896
It's pretty convenient, also,
I just think it's pretty neat.

236
00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:38.150
Cuz every now and then I add my vimrc and,
right, I hate to do that.
