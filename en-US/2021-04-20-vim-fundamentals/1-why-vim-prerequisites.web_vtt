1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
So why do I use vim, right?

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.760
Well, I was just like everybody
pretty much in this chat.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.540
At one point I accidentally opened up vim
or followed a tutorial to open up vim.

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.140
They told me to write something,
I got confused, I couldn't make it work,

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.600
I started typing in a bunch of stuff.

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.510
And then I couldn't figure it all out.

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.381
And eventually I just took my computer and
placed in the bathtub like I

8
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:24.540
didn't have any other choice at
that point, but to get rid of it.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.614
And eventually I figured out how to
exit vim, and it felt fantastic,

10
00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:28.780
I felt just like this guy.

11
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.330
Yes, this is one of just
a couple means about them.

12
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.730
We'll try to keep them short.

13
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.190
But I really felt I was somewhat of a
scientist after learning how to exit vim.

14
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.950
And, it was just so strange.

15
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.860
Like I couldn't fathom why
anyone would use this editor.

16
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.417
I remember being in college, and
my buddy Randy would use it and

17
00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:49.210
he was very fast at it.

18
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.727
And I'd go.

19
00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:51.090
Dude, why are you using that?

20
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.099
There's NetBeans.

21
00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:56.724
NetBeans, the superior editor you may
have heard of it and, It's just like I

22
00:00:56.724 --> 00:01:01.920
thought it was just silly to use it
like it didn't make any sense to me.

23
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.726
And for a long time I operated like that
I just I didn't understand why, right,

24
00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:10.814
until one day, I saw someone,
now they may have been using Emacs but

25
00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:13.364
they had been motions on and all that but.

26
00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:14.810
That's beside the point.

27
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.920
We're not high priests of
the Emacs church around here.

28
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.212
We're doing vim, all right, but
he was moving so fast and could do so

29
00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:22.670
many things.

30
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.740
Only with his keyboard at such a rate.

31
00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:26.660
My goodness.

32
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.037
I remember watching that and thinking,
my goodness, is he playing Starcraft.

33
00:01:30.037 --> 00:01:31.020
What is happening here?

34
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.710
This is incredible.

35
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.730
I want that whatever that is,
I want to be that good.

36
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.460
Because what I do today versus
what he does, I am terrible.

37
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.450
Like, I am just absolutely terrible.

38
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.420
And I just you know,
it just really stuck with me.

39
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.036
And so from that moment on, I decided,
okay, I'm going to get good.

40
00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:53.360
I'm gonna figure this out.

41
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.790
So I started first using, IntelliJ.

42
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.650
Right?
I think a lot of people probably use

43
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.680
IntelliJ or VS code, there might be a few
unfortunate souls that still use sublime.

44
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.750
Hey, sublime users.

45
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.786
I hope you guys are okay?

46
00:02:04.786 --> 00:02:07.590
You guys,
just come forward coming to anything else.

47
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.742
But, here's the deal is when I started.

48
00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:12.280
I started with just a plug in,
using my editor.

49
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.112
All right.
I do think that that's a pretty

50
00:02:14.112 --> 00:02:15.420
good approach.

51
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.730
Cuz Vim has its own motions.

52
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.963
Plus it's all of its own terminology and
all those things and so

53
00:02:20.963 --> 00:02:24.510
can get confusing just using Vim
by itself for the first time.

54
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.160
And so I did that for, a few years.

55
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.150
And then eventually I
made the switch to Vim.

56
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.405
And then I went to like Doom-emacs,
and then I went to spacemacs, and

57
00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:36.044
then I went to space Vim, and then I went
to NeoVim, and then I went back to Vim,

58
00:02:36.044 --> 00:02:38.430
and then now I'm back at NeoVim, right?

59
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.233
I tried all these different things,

60
00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:43.380
just tryna figure out how do
I make it feel good for me?

61
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.450
And it was a long and painful journey.

62
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.920
And I swear I was gonna quit, because
this is the learning curve for VIM.

63
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.580
Now the nice part is it's
mostly differentiable.

64
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.150
It's just really hard, at the beginning.

65
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.812
And then at least you got it right?

66
00:02:56.812 --> 00:03:00.331
Like, you've already done the hard part,
which is that first part, right and

67
00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:02.380
then it just gets hopefully easier.

68
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.000
But I decided at that point
I was going to be a master.

69
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.540
I wanted to be, the best at it.

70
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.460
I wanted to know everything
I could about it.

71
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.950
I wanted to really dive into it.

72
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.640
And it really has nothing
to do with programming.

73
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.280
You won't be a better programmer.

74
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.250
You won't you know,
you're not going to be smarter.

75
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.940
You're probably not even
going to be cooler.

76
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.580
Honestly, I don't think people can walk
around like, My gosh, he's watching them.

77
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.560
Look at him use vim.

78
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.600
Look at those h J's and KS, right?

79
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.350
Like no one's gonna be blown away.

80
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.030
But I was.

81
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.749
But either way,
it's just like one of these things that.

82
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.460
It has really helped me in some sense
because I enjoy the thing that I do,

83
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.380
it's not just simply about
getting to the end results.

84
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.262
When something doesn't work the way I want
it, I have an editor so configurable,

85
00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.540
I write it to be exactly
the way I want it to be.

86
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.340
And it always works
the way I want it to be.

87
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.693
Unless if you install a plugin
that they recently updated in,

88
00:03:57.693 --> 00:04:01.020
breaks your whole system, which may or
may not have happened this morning.

89
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.889
Fun fact, but.

90
00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.558
It's just one of these things that are so

91
00:04:04.558 --> 00:04:08.177
great about it is that it's totally,
how you want it?

92
00:04:08.177 --> 00:04:12.290
It's not how, people that turban
is kind of like the best.

93
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.690
What could be good, you're not falling
into the bucket of 80% like 20% hate.

94
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.390
It's exactly what you want,
how you want it and when you want it.

95
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.090
So the expectations I do want to set
these early, is that vim is confusing.

96
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.436
If you look around in the chat or
in the zoom meeting,

97
00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:33.260
just understand that if
you have a question.

98
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.020
Probably, everybody else, or
at least half of them do too.

99
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.320
And, if you don't ask it,
no one might ask it, so feel free to ask.

100
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.800
I do want you to feel free to interrupt.

101
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.259
It's not gonna throw me off track.

102
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.430
Just let me know.

103
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.050
And we will try to align it.

104
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.887
And if you have questions on the zoom
meetings, I will try to make space to be

105
00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:55.880
like, hey, if you have any questions,
now's a good time to ask.

106
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.650
And so that way it doesn't go right
in the middle of me saying something.

107
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.150
But.
That's the whole goal.

108
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.290
Please, ask questions.

109
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.500
All right, who am I?

110
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.480
Hi, I'm a person that makes
YouTube videos about vim.

111
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.692
I also stream on Twitch,
making like vim plugins making a death

112
00:05:11.692 --> 00:05:14.370
match that's like a Tetris
99 style death match.

113
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.606
I'm gonna catch a lot of flack for

114
00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:17.650
saying this because I haven't
worked on it in a month.

115
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.244
They're gonna be like,
I thought that was in the graveyard.

116
00:05:20.244 --> 00:05:21.070
My goodness.

117
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.987
Also make live beats with Sonic Pi and
Raspberry Pi's and

118
00:05:23.987 --> 00:05:28.180
doing everything where TwitchChat can
actually make the beat themselves.

119
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.698
We've made some really good bangers and
also it sounds like kids with drums you

120
00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:33.937
never know what you're
going to get when you let,

121
00:05:33.937 --> 00:05:35.990
just a bunch of people
take control of audio.

122
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.900
And lastly, I'll sometimes
stream me coding for Netflix.

123
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.030
Netflix allows me to do that.

124
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.020
I always get that same
question every time.

125
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.250
Does Netflix know you're, streaming
their code isn't that against NDA.

126
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.358
And I have to say, why would I leave
my multi billion dollar position,

127
00:05:51.358 --> 00:05:52.900
for streaming on Twitch?

128
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.380
That's just silly, come on,
of course I'm not gonna do that.

129
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.890
And yes, I do work at Netflix,
it's fantastic, lots of fun.

130
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.310
We're a super cool startup we ship
DVDs across the United States.

131
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.702
Who knows, maybe we're gonna
expand to like South America,

132
00:06:06.702 --> 00:06:10.030
who knows where we're gonna
go with this DVD business?

133
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.870
I feel good about it.

134
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.560
I think it's the future.

135
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.510
And so who should take this course?

136
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.608
If you want to be a developer or
you are a developer,

137
00:06:17.608 --> 00:06:21.390
I think that this is a good person,
to take the course.

138
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.170
You don't have to be great,
you don't have to be perfect.

139
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.760
You can be completely brand new.

140
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.820
One thing you really do need, though if
you want to have a desire to be excellent.

141
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.617
What I mean by that is that,
when you do something,

142
00:06:35.617 --> 00:06:39.090
do you just do it to get it done or
do you do it to do it well?

143
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.975
There's two different types of people and
sometimes job pressures and

144
00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:43.950
all that we all do it just to get it done.

145
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.480
But in the end,
do you enjoy the process itself?

146
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.290
Or is your goal just to get to the end?

147
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.180
Me personally, I want to enjoy both right?

148
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.632
I want to have a great experience doing
whatever I'm doing if it's from the most

149
00:06:56.632 --> 00:07:00.621
mundane tasks to the most complicated
task, and I also want to be able to

150
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:04.930
get it done, at a fast and awesome
pace and so that's why I like them.

151
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.300
And lastly,
you gotta want to defeat complacency.

152
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.260
I think a lot of people end up downloading
VS code because it's just out there or

153
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.200
IntelliJ or whatever you use.

154
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.990
You use it.

155
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.640
You get used to some of these weird
shortcuts you know, to look up files,

156
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.560
whatever you're like.

157
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.825
All right, well, it just works,
and I can do my job.

158
00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:23.435
Yeah, I don't really like to add,
I don't like this but whatever.

159
00:07:23.435 --> 00:07:26.575
I just want to get stuff done right,
and you just become complacent.

160
00:07:26.575 --> 00:07:30.737
You don't really try to grow or learn more
about the command line, how to get tighter

161
00:07:30.737 --> 00:07:34.795
how to parse, you know, some fun stuff
like you don't take it to any next levels.

162
00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:37.335
You just always remain,
where you're kinda at.

163
00:07:37.335 --> 00:07:39.260
You have no idea how build system works.

164
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.170
You just like I don't care.

165
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.026
I just press play and things work and
whatever if it breaks, I just go and

166
00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:46.161
take the day off right like it's just.

167
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:49.489
I want to always be getting better and
more knowledge and so,

168
00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:52.960
defeat complacency is one of
the one of the big ones here.

169
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.040
Some prerequisites.

170
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.680
I hope everybody here has a Unix system.

171
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.832
If you have windows,

172
00:07:57.832 --> 00:08:01.960
everything that I will be showing
you should work but the deal is.

173
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.980
I don't know anything about Windows.

174
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.910
That's the reality.

175
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.983
I haven't used it,
other than to play Apex or Tarkov and

176
00:08:08.983 --> 00:08:14.630
that's about it like I don't use Windows
and so I can't help you that much.

177
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.916
I use Ubuntu or Piebuntu as I like to
call it because all the plebs use it and

178
00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:21.670
It just works really, really well there.

179
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.370
And so it should work also really well for
Mac as well.

180
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.980
Typing skills will directly
affect your experience.

181
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.659
Meaning if that you're hunting and
pecking for keys, a,

182
00:08:30.659 --> 00:08:34.390
you can learn how to edit text
using a fewer amount of keys.

183
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.310
And it could actually
help improve your speed.

184
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.620
But overall, the better you are at typing,
the more effective you're going to be,

185
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.210
especially at a tool that's
centered around typing.

186
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.430
There's also a lot of flavours of him,
right?

187
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.080
I don't know if you know this,
but there's vim improved or vim.

188
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.910
That's where we get it from.

189
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.920
There's NeoVim,
that's the one I currently use.

190
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.960
I've been loving using NeoVim for
like the last year.

191
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.339
I'm gonna try not to do,

192
00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:01.810
too many things NeoVim specific towards
the end when I'm pontificating.

193
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.350
As I said earlier, we'll probably
jump into some NeoVim specific stuff.

194
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.980
I might have a little break here and
there.

195
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.910
There's also spacevim,
if you've never used spacevim.

196
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.530
I did use that for a little bit
between my do Max and my space max.

197
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.183
I think as pitstop that spacevim,

198
00:09:14.183 --> 00:09:18.570
it's like a batteries included style that
they're gonna have everything set up.

199
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.380
That's gonna give you the autocomplete
that's gonna give you nice color schemes.

200
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.618
You know,
it's going to be more managed for you.

201
00:09:24.618 --> 00:09:25.830
There's also only vim two.

202
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.770
This one's actually, it's interesting.

203
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.670
Someone's trying to combine, as they say.

204
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:37.440
The UI styles of VS code, the model
editing of vim, and the speed of sublime.

205
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.590
They do mention sublime.

206
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.230
I mean, negative one points,
but that's okay.

207
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.240
Hey, no one's chatting around here.

208
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.335
But it's a pretty cool project
I've talked to the person who may,

209
00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:48.540
who's made it I played around
with a little bit is pretty fun.

210
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.990
But in the end, I use NeoVim.

211
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.896
You can also learn,
vim in other places right?

212
00:09:54.896 --> 00:09:55.660
Vimtutor.

213
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.420
If you just jump into anywhere and
just type in vimtutor right here.

214
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.549
It should open this up, and it will
be a long, very beautifully styled.

215
00:10:03.549 --> 00:10:05.510
Think about how to use them.

216
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.540
And you can jump all over and
learn a bunch of just basic commands.

217
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.941
And if you do this.

218
00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:12.730
You will learn a lot.

219
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.680
And this could be a good thing to
reinforce some of your learnings.

220
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.880
It won't touch on some of the deeper
concepts, but it definitely does help.

221
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.469
A place that actually does touch on some
deeper concepts has been adventures.

222
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.716
It's a fun little game you play and
you walk around as a guy using just vim,

223
00:10:28.716 --> 00:10:30.197
you know, vim shortcuts and

224
00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:34.335
eventually you get into these more complex
puzzle solving situations where you

225
00:10:34.335 --> 00:10:38.000
have to use some of the deeper features
of vim, all emulated as a game.

226
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.650
So it's actually it's unique.

227
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.970
It's kind of fun.

228
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.960
I also have some like basic commands and

229
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.320
some various like topical
points on YouTube.

230
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.350
There's a ton of YouTube content.

231
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.470
There's a ton of people
that stream it on Twitch.

232
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.760
It's available, right?

233
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.140
It's all over the place.

234
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.710
If you like reading, there's blogs.

235
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.100
If you like reading help documents,
there's a ton of documentation.

236
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.995
As you can see right here,
I do :h user and then say tab.

237
00:10:59.995 --> 00:11:03.084
What I mean by that is if you open up vim,
and you type type colon,

238
00:11:03.084 --> 00:11:04.585
you'll go into command mode.

239
00:11:04.585 --> 00:11:08.845
We'll cover a lot of this in a little bit,
type h and then user and hit tab.

240
00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:11.005
You'll be given a huge
number of documents.

241
00:11:11.005 --> 00:11:12.235
I'm just gonna open them one at random.

242
00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:13.514
I have never read 11.

243
00:11:13.514 --> 00:11:15.585
11 says, Did your computer crash?

244
00:11:15.585 --> 00:11:16.875
Are you just wow, look at this.

245
00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:17.435
Don't panic.

246
00:11:17.435 --> 00:11:20.490
Vim stores enough information to be
able to restore most of your work.

247
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.390
This is fantastic.

248
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.800
Most of your work is better
than none of your work.

249
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.900
Anyways, that's like a thing.

250
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.760
So it has like all these
different ways to learn them.

251
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.570
And it's all written just with them.

252
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.240
So that's actually a really
fantastic resource.

253
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.640
And yes, I actually had no idea
what that one was gonna be.

254
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.240
I'm very happy with the crash
what feels just so exciting.
