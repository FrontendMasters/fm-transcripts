1
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.545
All right, so, as I was saying earlier,
just right now that before this,

2
00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:07.396
we were in the intro section.

3
00:00:07.396 --> 00:00:09.284
So I was taking it very slow,

4
00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:13.620
I was intentionally telling
you every move I was making.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.298
From here on out,

6
00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:17.160
we're gonna start speeding up cuz
there's a lot of stuff we want to cover.

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.894
A lot of cool things and I wanna
make sure you have that opportunity,

8
00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:26.810
okay, so let's start making vim my way,
not the vim way, but my way.

9
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.066
Yes, exactly, thank you.

10
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.983
For those that can't see the zoom call is
just beautiful, everything was fine for

11
00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:32.880
a second.

12
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.604
So remember when we are in this file,
let's see,

13
00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:40.072
let it so
just recall your previous file down.

14
00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:45.032
Whatever what I believe is insert mode,
remember how I had to keep on using ZZ to

15
00:00:45.032 --> 00:00:48.350
center myself,
that was kind of annoying, right?

16
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.706
You didn't wanna have to
do that all the time,

17
00:00:51.706 --> 00:00:55.850
so we're gonna execute our
first vim command together.

18
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.096
It's gonna be a magical moment and
remember, so I'm gonna go into command

19
00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:02.510
mode, call to go into command
mode when you're in normal mode.

20
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.750
There we go and I'm going to do this set,
scrolloff= 8, just scroll off, right?

21
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.960
I don't know it feels like an insult
almost, I'm gonna hit enter.

22
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.122
Now what this means is that
when I'm eight lines away,

23
00:01:16.122 --> 00:01:18.880
it will automatically start scrolling for
me.

24
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.590
So that way it is nicer until you
get to the bottom of the file.

25
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.893
So here, let me zoom out a little bit,
if I zoom out a little bit,

26
00:01:24.893 --> 00:01:26.320
you'll notice it's not quite there.

27
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.638
If I too zoomed in, this file is
a little too small to show it, but

28
00:01:29.638 --> 00:01:31.430
you can kinda see it, right?

29
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.440
Things stay more centered or
they'll at least be like bottom centered.

30
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.832
So this is very, very nice little feature
to have, I love it, I didn't have it for

31
00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:43.050
a long time,
cuz I just didn't even know it existed.

32
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.840
So just remember that that's a command you
can execute in vim and it'll be awesome.

33
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.180
So let's quit this,
now give you the next thing to do this.

34
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.930
It feels good though, right, yes,
all right, so let's quit vim, and

35
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.882
we're gonna download this upcoming file,
okay?

36
00:01:55.882 --> 00:02:00.260
So now we're gonna start moving a little
bit faster, doing some pretty fun things.

37
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.053
So I'm gonna copy this file,
I will throw it into chat,

38
00:02:04.053 --> 00:02:08.180
curl these unknown files,
let's edit them together okay?

39
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.820
How many times did I make that joke before
it gets old, I don't even know, but

40
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.240
we're gonna keep doing it.

41
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.320
All right, so we're gonna press enter and
now we have a lot more.

42
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.462
So once again,
notice that if I scroll all the way down,

43
00:02:20.462 --> 00:02:23.990
do you see scroll off didn't stay.

44
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.420
Why in a weird, so
I'm gonna do it again set, scrolloff=8.

45
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.849
Wow that's inconvenient to do but
as I scroll hey, that's really nice,

46
00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.370
I like to be able to move around and
actually move the screen with me.

47
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.008
So now let's all together go down
to the delete that description, so

48
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.090
how you learn how to delete is using dd.

49
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.390
So let's just do that dd that
together dddddddddddddddd.

50
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.050
There we go, we did it.

51
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.200
We just ran through that pretty quickly,
let's undo that.

52
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.323
Okay, let's undo our changes,
we just got done doing and

53
00:02:55.323 --> 00:02:57.310
we're gonna do it differently now.

54
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.694
All right, we're gonna use 7dd,
what I just did there is I said,

55
00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:08.140
hey, delete these lines,
but do it 7 times.

56
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.627
That was pretty awesome, right,

57
00:03:10.627 --> 00:03:16.050
you just did a bunch of deleting In very
little effort but why was that hard?

58
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.260
Think about that for a moment,
what made that kind of hard to do?

59
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.390
Well, one of the reasons why it made it
hard to do, is you have no line numbers.

60
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.321
How in the world are you supposed to do,
what am I supposed to do, sorry,

61
00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:29.420
wrong direction.

62
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.570
What am I supposed to do,
there's no lines, right here and

63
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.280
that's problematic, right?

64
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.088
You want to be able to
know where you're at, so

65
00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:41.390
what we're gonna do is we do
another set command, set number.

66
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.560
What this will do is that will
set the numbers into your editor.

67
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.403
My goodness you probably are ready start,
you're starting the feel like,

68
00:03:49.403 --> 00:03:50.910
hey wait a second.

69
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.740
This feels more familiar I'm starting
to not feel as lost as I once was.

70
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.780
And so now we can retry 7dd again,
okay, 9 minus15 is 6.

71
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.479
All right, so with dd and the numbers
I have to do one plus the math, and

72
00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.688
I have to do the math in my head.

73
00:04:08.688 --> 00:04:13.180
My goodness this is like not easy, well,
guess what, there's an answer for you.

74
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.340
Set, relative number, now relative and
number is a lot of things to type.

75
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.931
If you don't wanna quite type it
all do rela and then hit tab and

76
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:26.487
it will complete for
you relative number and

77
00:04:26.487 --> 00:04:31.420
if you really don't even wanna type that,
you can just do rnu for short, right?

78
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.563
Relative number,
I know great way to remember,

79
00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:36.870
hit Enter and look what it's done.

80
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.609
We have kept our line number
on our current cursor, but

81
00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:45.150
then everything else is a relative
offset from your cursor.

82
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.810
Now this may seem a little strange and
I totally get it, it is a little strange.

83
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.183
It's not like other editors, you wouldn't
do this in other editors because you use

84
00:04:53.183 --> 00:04:55.180
a mouse and you move around.

85
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.884
But for vim, it makes a lot of sense,
now I was a relative number hater,

86
00:04:59.884 --> 00:05:04.290
okay, I was all about like no way
I was just not gonna happen right?

87
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.760
I was throwing my little danglers all
around, very upset about it but instead

88
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.035
I've learned to love it because I got good
at the commands that use relative numbers.

89
00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:18.498
So now it's at least easier,
I can go okay,

90
00:05:18.498 --> 00:05:20.703
I wanna delete up to the function 7dd.

91
00:05:20.703 --> 00:05:25.838
Awesome, right,
you know what you can also do,

92
00:05:25.838 --> 00:05:29.690
you can also go like this d6J.

93
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.533
I want to delete six downwards,

94
00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:37.390
now that might feel a little
bit better to you, right?

95
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.728
Or you can do something like shift V,
six J,

96
00:05:40.728 --> 00:05:45.880
now you know what you're about
to delete let's hit Delete.

97
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.683
Now notice that we're starting to take all
these commands that we've kind of used and

98
00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:54.100
we're starting to kinda build
them up into a composed item.

99
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.674
It's feeling a lot better, right,

100
00:05:56.674 --> 00:06:00.670
now you can start seeing there
is actual speed benefits.
