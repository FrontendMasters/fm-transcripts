1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.440
And so let's quit VIM for
one quick second.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.138
Now, I assume everyone remembers
how to quit VIM colon q.

3
00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.320
You have to be a normal mode.

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.800
You will now quit VIM.

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.490
You press enter and my goodness.

6
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.650
What just happened?

7
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.290
Look what it says.

8
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.670
It says no, right?

9
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.980
Since last change,
it's trying to save you right now.

10
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.430
It's trying to say, Hey.

11
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.750
You just wrote stuff for
a file, but you didn't save it.

12
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.080
So you have two choices.

13
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.940
We can either save the file or
get rid of it.

14
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.680
I'm gonna opt in to getting rid of it.

15
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.540
But you can either do right
quit to write it and then quit.

16
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.313
Or you can do quit bang, and
this will simply force quit and

17
00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:40.009
ignore anything that hasn't
been written yet alright?

18
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.290
So it's like your way of kinda
getting in and out of it.

19
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.230
And so now let's start doing
some basic navigations together.

20
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.730
Okay, so this is where it's gonna
get pretty exciting, hopefully.

21
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.400
So I'm gonna actually just copy this.

22
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.070
I'm gonna go over here.

23
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.630
I'll paste this in the chat.

24
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.540
You can just copy and paste it.

25
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.518
Yes, please curl down something
you don't know what it is and

26
00:00:58.518 --> 00:01:00.020
let it be put onto your system.

27
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.050
And let's edit it.

28
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.310
It's just the internet.

29
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.070
It's safe, trust me.

30
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.620
Alright, so I'm gonna do the same thing.

31
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.040
I'm gonna curl this down.

32
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.260
What it will do is it will
curl down a basic lesson.

33
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.881
And then it's gonna save it to a file
called exercise.md markdown, and

34
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:17.340
then we're gonna execute vim, exercise md.

35
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.260
This should just work, trademark,
that phrase should just work.

36
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.950
Here we go.

37
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.110
So I'm gonna press enter, and this is what
it approximately should look like for you.

38
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.290
I'm using Neo vim, so
the colors may be a little bit different.

39
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.370
But overall, this is what it's
going to look like for you.

40
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.104
So this is actually just a file from this
presentations repo so you can go and

41
00:01:36.104 --> 00:01:37.920
look at it if you want to.

42
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.849
So let's start moving together alright?

43
00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.314
So I'll have the keys being
displayed down here so

44
00:01:42.314 --> 00:01:44.650
you'll be able to see me move around.

45
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.530
But the first exercise
is to learn about j.

46
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.660
We're in normal mode, right?

47
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.700
Yes, it doesn't say
anything else down below.

48
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.370
You can press j to walk.

49
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.150
So let's press j and
go all the way down to j.

50
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.130
Once you've done that you've
completed your first set of motions.

51
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.940
You are now moving,
man doesn't that just feel so slow?

52
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.860
Like, why would you ever wanna
edit text just pressing j?

53
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.070
[LAUGH] I agree with you.

54
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.120
Don't worry, it's gonna get better.

55
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.940
Hey, at least you can move downwards now.

56
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.226
Okay, we're going someplace and if you
remember Bill Joy's keyboard if you're

57
00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:20.640
paying attention, you could probably
guess the rest of the letters.

58
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.135
Alright, so let's go down a little bit
further, all the way down to this line

59
00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:29.980
right here, which is now gonna tell you
to press l to follow the line to the o.

60
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.860
And then we'll press x together.

61
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.827
So I'm gonna go over and I'm gonna press l
don't hold it don't cheat now, the reason

62
00:02:35.827 --> 00:02:39.620
why you don't want to cheat is you want
this to set into your memory, right?

63
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.480
You want to press it for
now until you can really feel it.

64
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.808
A little bit of kinda like
some hidden vim knowledge

65
00:02:46.808 --> 00:02:52.360
holding j holding k holding l
holding h are anti patterns.

66
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.883
Don't do that you should never be in
a situation in which you're holding

67
00:02:55.883 --> 00:02:58.170
something because that is incorrect.

68
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.049
But for now we're just gonna be pressing
it, it's gonna be the worst possible way

69
00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.430
of navigating because you
need to just get it in here.

70
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.874
Alright, so let's press x.

71
00:03:04.874 --> 00:03:09.320
x will delete a single character
that is underneath your cursor.

72
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.820
Strange, right?

73
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.840
Why would you ever do that?

74
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.420
It can't happen that often.

75
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.820
Surprisingly yes,
x will have it a lot in your lifetime.

76
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.778
It is mind numbing how often x happens.

77
00:03:20.778 --> 00:03:23.420
Anyways so let's keep going down.

78
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.240
You can press j to go down.

79
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.840
Now notice something.

80
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.600
My cursor is at the bottom of the screen
I don't know what's coming up next.

81
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.720
This feels really uncomfortable.

82
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.390
Now this is not the way you should do it,
but for now, this is what we'll do.

83
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.130
Press zz.

84
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.350
Lowercase zz.

85
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.480
Uppercase zz does quit, so
don't get your cases mixed up.

86
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.590
So lowercase zz will recenter your screen.

87
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.784
And let's go down, down, down.

88
00:03:49.784 --> 00:03:50.560
What just happened there?

89
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.480
Why is my cursor so far forward?

90
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.960
Notice that that my cursor
jumped all the way over.

91
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.320
Why is that?

92
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.630
Well, that's because the line that
we left had our cursor way up here.

93
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.380
So then we'll maintain
your cursor position.

94
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.964
And so if you go on two lines,

95
00:04:04.964 --> 00:04:09.900
your cursor could bounce around depending
on its last furthest known location.

96
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.460
So maybe a little bit disorienting,
but it happens.

97
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.420
So let's keep doing this.

98
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.700
Now notice that the instructions say hey,
use j and l to walk.

99
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.300
But look at me.

100
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.312
I'm just like walking.

101
00:04:19.312 --> 00:04:20.400
No, I'm at the bottom.

102
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.840
Something like zz again.

103
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.505
I'm just like walking downwards and
it's just all walking to o for me,

104
00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:27.990
because we are already so far out.

105
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.087
So now that I've reached o,
I'm gonna press x deleted again.

106
00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:35.069
For those that are going along with me,
I am trying to leave enough time for

107
00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.880
you to be able to do this and
walk along with me.

108
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.592
So if I'm telling a story or saying
something that seems a little off topic,

109
00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:44.330
just buying some time, okay,
I'm just here for you.

110
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.416
That's, what I'm trying to do here okay?

111
00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:48.500
So let's keep going down.

112
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.690
But this time we're gonna do
something a little bit different.

113
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.684
When we get to here you can recenter again
if you'd like to good habit that you know

114
00:04:54.684 --> 00:04:58.742
you're just learning some keystrokes
you're learning how to kinda move stuff,

115
00:04:58.742 --> 00:05:01.960
press h to go over once, and
then press l to come back.

116
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.244
Now at this point, your cursor will
not automatically bounce over because

117
00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:09.820
the furthest known location
is the second column n right?

118
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.014
So now let's go down j j j over
over over over over over j j j,

119
00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:21.591
then the other direction h h h h j j l l
l l l j z z, I'm gonna recenter things.

120
00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:24.650
j j over over over and over.

121
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.312
And this is gonna take a little bit of
time you'll probably find that this is

122
00:05:27.312 --> 00:05:28.550
actually a little bit difficult.

123
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.530
You'll have to like think.

124
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.361
Okay, I need to go left it's left l over
h and you'll probably try them both and

125
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:35.310
you'll get kinda confused.

126
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.940
When you get to the end hit
that x feels great, right?

127
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.360
We did it, we got it.

128
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.510
Things are getting better.

129
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.350
You have so many keys now that you know.

130
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.990
So we're gonna go back we're
gonna go further down.

131
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.594
We're gonna do it again but

132
00:05:46.594 --> 00:05:50.165
this time we're gonna add in
the last one which is gonna be k.

133
00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:51.190
k goes up.

134
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.574
So now we're gonna have a little
bit of a foot race okay?

135
00:05:54.574 --> 00:05:58.456
I'm gonna see if I can go all
the way down to the o, delete it and

136
00:05:58.456 --> 00:06:00.240
go all the way back.

137
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.981
The first person to finish it in
the Zoom call, please say hey,

138
00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:04.910
I just did it, alright?

139
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.760
Let's see if I can be twice
as fast I went off the rails.

140
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.250
Is that a disqualification?

141
00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:15.630
No, I actually pressed a button that
I'm not supposed to press or not.

142
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.550
We'll talk about that later.

143
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.010
My goodness.

144
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.840
This guy is so fast.

145
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.291
I think you've been h j k and
l before, haven't you?

146
00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:27.680
Coming in here with your big scales.

147
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.470
Alright that's good though.

148
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.490
That is awesome.

149
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.400
I'm happy to see that you're able
to move and to do these things.

150
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.940
This is really, really good.

151
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.000
Now, this is absurd.

152
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.490
Okay, I want to let you know, this is
not how text editing looks in them.

153
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.224
But this is very good to have these
fundamental movements down because often,

154
00:06:45.224 --> 00:06:47.671
you may be off by a single row or
two rows.

155
00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:51.209
You're off by a character or
two characters and it's just better solved

156
00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:55.140
with little quick movements and
you don't want to have your brain go.

157
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.440
How do you go down?

158
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.668
Is that j or k?

159
00:06:57.668 --> 00:06:59.100
Let's try k dang.

160
00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.770
That's up.

161
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.760
Let's press j right?

162
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.710
Like you don't wanna have to
go through these thoughts.

163
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.010
And the only way to get there
is by practice and using it.

164
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.104
And so when I first started to kinda
answer that original question of hey,

165
00:07:11.104 --> 00:07:13.310
this all feels super overwhelming.

166
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.220
I don't know what to do.

167
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.720
How do you learn all this stuff?

168
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.577
The way that I did that was I
started with just h, j, k and l and

169
00:07:20.577 --> 00:07:25.654
the next couple commands and that is it or
the next couple motions technically,

170
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:28.790
and I forced myself to get good at those.

171
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.020
And then I moved on.

172
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.800
Today, we will be kinda going over a lot.

173
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.540
So, you know, what's available.

174
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.070
Cuz I didn't even know what was available.

175
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.700
As I got better, I was like,
well, how do I go faster?

176
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.310
What do I do?

177
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.299
And people would tell
me a little secrets and

178
00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:44.010
I feel I just have all this
secret knowledge of him.

179
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.390
But it's just out there.

180
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.550
So I'm gonna help everyone
get to the right spot.

181
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.910
So let's go down, down, down.

182
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.120
I'm gonna use z z again to get there.

183
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.031
Now we're gonna be way over so
everyone just hold h,

184
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:59.070
I know I told you not to hold, but for
the sake of today, hold h to right here.

185
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.350
And now we're gonna go to w.

186
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:06.550
Now w probably does
what you think it might

187
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.560
do which is to hop by word, w w w w right?

188
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.490
Not too hard let me just get rid of this.

189
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.130
There we go.

190
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.550
So there you go.

191
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.322
I've made it to o.

192
00:08:18.322 --> 00:08:20.301
Now notice something
kind of unique about w.

193
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:21.110
Here I'm gonna go.

194
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.021
I'm gonna go all the way back when I
press w it hopped to the beginning of

195
00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:30.400
every non-white space
character up until the l.

196
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.110
The reason why is it hops by words and

197
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.570
there's certain tokens that
are considered a word in a word delimiter.

198
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.450
This happens to be one of
those breaking points.

199
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.250
So just jumped up to the o.

200
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.330
Now that we're at the l, we can press x.

201
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.030
Fantastic.

202
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.424
And now let's go down and
we're gonna do this again except for

203
00:08:46.424 --> 00:08:47.800
we're gonna include b.

204
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.810
So follow with me.

205
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.620
So press b to go all the way back.

206
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.420
Yeah, b's pretty great.

207
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.480
If you overshoot, press w to go forward
until you get to the beginning.

208
00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:01.259
So we're at the beginning, we'll press w,
w, w, w, look what happened there,

209
00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:06.870
because it didn't detect the next word
until the next line we landed here.

210
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.120
So now let's press j to go down.

211
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.653
I know, if you were to press w
would have went straight to o,

212
00:09:11.653 --> 00:09:12.780
little secret shortcut.

213
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.268
Don't do the supermario shortcut okay?

214
00:09:15.268 --> 00:09:16.245
We don't wanna do that here.

215
00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:17.575
So press j to go down.

216
00:09:17.575 --> 00:09:21.017
And then once you're here,
press b to walk backwards right?

217
00:09:21.017 --> 00:09:23.070
One at a time, and
notice where it stopped.

218
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.160
Once again, o and
dash are two different delimiting items.

219
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.130
And so now you have to press b once more,
and you'll go to the o.

220
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.920
Let's hit x, we just did it,
we dang done it fantastic.

221
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.569
Hopefully, you're feeling
super confident at this point.

222
00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:40.539
You've got your h, j, k's and
w's and b's all in your head and

223
00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:44.240
l is gonna make it there at some point,
but you're feeling really good.

224
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.595
So last little thing I have right here is
just a little kinda fun figure eight that

225
00:09:48.595 --> 00:09:49.610
we can go on.

226
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.630
So everyone just try to go through
a twice, just pressing the keys, right?

227
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:57.170
Go all the way with l, go down,
go back up and then go back with h.

228
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.040
And then once you go all
the way back to the top,

229
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.382
try going the other direction just so
it kind of hopefully fits a little

230
00:10:04.382 --> 00:10:09.165
bit better in your head cuz the reason why
I'm making such a big deal out of this

231
00:10:09.165 --> 00:10:12.720
is we're primarily gonna use j and
k a ton today alright?

232
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.830
It's just gonna happen a bunch.

233
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.196
And so I just really wanna make sure
you're at least familiar with j and

234
00:10:19.196 --> 00:10:19.788
k h and l.

235
00:10:19.788 --> 00:10:22.935
I don't really use them that often,
but they do happen.

236
00:10:22.935 --> 00:10:24.366
So awesome we've done it.

237
00:10:24.366 --> 00:10:25.260
Quickly chat.

238
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.340
How do we quit VIM or meet?

239
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.050
I don't know how fast chat is.

240
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.320
How to quit vim question mark.

241
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.540
Can they actually respond to me in time?

242
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.320
I don't even know.

243
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.900
Let's find out.

244
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.250
But what is it?
What do you press?

245
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.850
Anybody who's been paying attention?

246
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.340
Say it.

247
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.000
There you go, colon q fantastic.

248
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.930
So colon q.

249
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.026
Bam.

250
00:10:46.026 --> 00:10:47.340
No happened again.

251
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.270
What do you do?

252
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.480
Either colon q bang or
w q to write it alright?

253
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.460
There we go.

254
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.860
We've done it.

255
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.516
So now we're actually gonna there we go.

256
00:10:55.516 --> 00:10:57.300
Yeah, look at all those golf games.

257
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.490
Look what's happening here.

258
00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.020
This is chat, this is fantastic.

259
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:01.837
Good job chat.
