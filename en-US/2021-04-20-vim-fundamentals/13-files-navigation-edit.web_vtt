00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.770
So let's move on and some navigations.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.550
Let's use edit to open some files.

3
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.370
I know we just went on a huge,
detour there.

4
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.833
We are using net rw, we could use J and
K to go around, we could press enter to,

5
00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:15.160
enter into folders or
to enter into the file itself.

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.075
There are other things you can do
with net rw such as creating files,

7
00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:20.530
deleting files,
you can also open and split.

8
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.180
You can have it look a lot nicer.

9
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.406
There's some other stuff to it,
but that's kind of configuration,

10
00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:27.380
you can look that up, not hard to do.

11
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.004
So let's use Edit, so Edit or E for short,

12
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:35.480
allows you to also open up files,
you Edit a file.

13
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.770
So let's open up them in
the vim-nav-playground.

14
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.762
And now we're in the file tree,
but we're not gonna use it,

15
00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:47.480
we're gonna instead go colon E and
I can press Ctrl D, and there you go.

16
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.096
Notice that that is pretty much
the same view as my tree view, so

17
00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:55.738
I can go, okay, let's open up the
exercise.js, I can press E, press tab, and

18
00:00:55.738 --> 00:00:58.060
it'll give me a couple options.

19
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.010
I do want to use the top option so
I'll just press Enter.

20
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.840
There we go, I'm now here.

21
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.980
I can do that again, E, I can use
Tab just to walk around in there.

22
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.365
There you go, there's all of them,
use Tab to walk around.

23
00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:11.790
Ctrl next, let's go to the source.

24
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.270
And then, now I can start
typing again what's in here.

25
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.450
Let's press Ctrl D, once again,
all right, there's also,

26
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.040
I can use Ctrl D to see what's in there,
all right?

27
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.960
It's just one item,
use Tab to auto complete it.

28
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.160
Okay, that's kind of nice, but
in the end using E to edit,

29
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.352
there are ways to make it
kind of fuzzy find for

30
00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:35.140
you, but ultimately,
still kinda feels like a nerd tree, right?

31
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.690
You're still walking to the thing you
want to do, and you have to type to it.

32
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.770
It's like, it's not that efficient, right?

33
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.450
You can pick it up a little bit,
by doing something like E star star al and

34
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.870
hitting tab and
it'll try to find this for me.

35
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.950
There we go maybe up, my goodness.

36
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.800
E is a little I use it star
also right there you go.

37
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.226
I got it, we found it right star star
slash star hit tab is starting to find

38
00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:04.100
them all you can do some basic fuzzy
finding, but that's only okay, right?

39
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.410
That's not something I'm gonna use on the
regular, I want something faster, better.

40
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.620
I want something that kind of
feels more like VS code, right?

41
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.190
When you press Ctrl P, I assume in VS
code, it opens up like a Quick Find menu.

42
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.396
Like that's something that probably
everybody wants, which is a fast way to be

43
00:02:19.396 --> 00:02:23.070
able to find files quickly and
of course, what's the answer?

44
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.526
Them has one, what keys do you press?

45
00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:29.320
Remap, that's what you got to do,
come on remap already.
