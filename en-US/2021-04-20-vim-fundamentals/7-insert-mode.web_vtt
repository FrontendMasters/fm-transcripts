00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.936
So let's go to insert,
now you're probably thinking insert,

2
00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:10.990
it's just I right, [LAUGH] no, there's
a lot of ways to go into insert mode.

3
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.518
And it's quite fantastic, in fact, this is
actually one of my favorite things about

4
00:00:14.518 --> 00:00:17.000
vim is how many different ways
you can go into insert mode.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.724
I know this just a sounding ridic, as I
say it out loud, I'm like, am I really

6
00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:27.330
saying this, out loud, yes, I am, I am
saying this out loud, insert mode, I know.

7
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.962
Like I said,

8
00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:32.110
it's gonna be shocking how many available
ways you can go into insert mode.

9
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.816
And I'm only gonna give you a few of them
here, because if I give too many now,

10
00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:38.970
you're gonna lose,
there's some really good ones later.

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.637
All right, so let's curl it in and let's
go, so now we're going to do insert mode,

12
00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:45.140
so this is where it gets real exciting,
right?

13
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.283
So let's use j to go all the way
down j to the I, all right, so I,

14
00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:56.680
and then use w to kind of go into it so
you kind of can see where we're at.

15
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.699
So now know notice that my
cursor is thick, right?,

16
00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.730
it's a thick cursor,
I actually prefer it this way.

17
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.669
So when I go into visual when I go
into insert mode actually maintain

18
00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:09.230
the thickness of the cursor, just
an old habit, it's hard to make a die.

19
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.130
I don't want it to die, but you can make
it however you want, so when I press I,

20
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.990
notice that my cursor goes to the left.

21
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.737
Up to the left, so I got a mirror
myself to the left of my cursor,

22
00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:23.810
right, that's unusual.

23
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.795
And when I press escape,
notice that my cursor moved back one, so

24
00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:34.190
if I were to go, I escape,
I would slowly walk myself back.

25
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.280
So that is how insert effectively works,

26
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.920
now notice what happens when I press a
instead, a opens the cursor to the right.

27
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.342
Now this is a small distinction, but

28
00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:50.240
it's actually pretty darn
useful in a lot of situations.

29
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.805
Often you'll be off by one and
probably in your current editor,

30
00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:56.440
which I'm just going to assume is Nano.

31
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.577
You probably have to press like
an arrow key to go over, and

32
00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:03.430
then you have to start typing and
that just is kind of annoying, right?

33
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.927
You don't want to have
to be in that position,

34
00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:09.020
it is really nice just to press a and
e go over.

35
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.648
Now, a and I are very important because
they're used in other commands as well,

36
00:02:13.648 --> 00:02:18.100
and we'll get to them and
they mean effectively the same thing.

37
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.254
Means on the inside a means
on the outside, all right, so

38
00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:24.630
let's go down, and
here's the first example of it.

39
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.973
I want to go into insert mode, but

40
00:02:26.973 --> 00:02:31.870
I want to go at the first non
whitespace character in this line.

41
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.819
Well, I can use shift I, there we go,
I just walked right into the first non

42
00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.950
whitespace character at
the beginning of this line.

43
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.999
That's pretty cool, right, so
I'm going to, escape, insert mode, and

44
00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:47.648
we're gonna go down but before we go down,
I'm gonna go back so I'm at the beginning.

45
00:02:47.648 --> 00:02:53.545
We're gonna go down now and now shift a,
I am assuming most people can guess what's

46
00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:58.950
going to happen here, which is you're
going to now go to the end of the line.

47
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.604
So when I hit shift a I'll go
to the end of the line, but

48
00:03:02.604 --> 00:03:06.423
not just the end of the line,
if there's any additional

49
00:03:06.423 --> 00:03:11.030
trailing whitespace then it will
also go on the end of that.

50
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.217
So unlike I which only
goes to the first and

51
00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:17.180
non whitespace character a goes
always to the end of the line.

52
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.993
So you got to kind of keep that in your
head a little bit, but that is how capital

53
00:03:20.993 --> 00:03:25.190
I and capital a works, and trust me
capital a is actually incredibly useful.

54
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.486
I don't use capital I that often,
but capital A,

55
00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:30.800
you will always find yourself needing
to go to the end of the line.

56
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.486
And this is just something you're gonna
have to either use today with your mouse

57
00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:37.930
just to simply move it over or
use the arrow keys to try to get it right.

58
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.946
And that's often annoying, I'm sure
there's some sort of sweet VS code

59
00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:45.961
shortcut that I don't know about
because I don't use VS code anyways, so

60
00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:49.750
let's escape insert mode and
go down one more line.

61
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.204
So now we're gonna get into the o's now
o was just mentioned o is fantastic,

62
00:03:54.204 --> 00:03:56.950
o is a glorious way to
go into insert mode.

63
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.088
In fact, it's one of my favorite,
okay, when you press o,

64
00:04:01.088 --> 00:04:06.283
It makes a new line respects the indenting
of the language that you're in and

65
00:04:06.283 --> 00:04:08.620
puts you into insert mode.

66
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.454
So if you have a function that's
defined by two scoreless and

67
00:04:12.454 --> 00:04:17.129
then you press o it will properly indent
you into that line, that is very.

68
00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.964
That is when I learned about I think I
might have taken the day off Just patting

69
00:04:21.964 --> 00:04:23.390
myself on the back.

70
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.482
I was so excited, it was like the best it
was just so great, I know this is fairly

71
00:04:27.482 --> 00:04:31.822
ridiculous to be that excited about going
into insert mode but it really does just,

72
00:04:31.822 --> 00:04:35.310
I love these type of shortcuts that
just make small things faster.

73
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.998
All right, you just don't have to
do as many little things, alright,

74
00:04:38.998 --> 00:04:40.720
let's leave insert mode.

75
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.716
Let's go down and let's try capital O,
if capital P does what it does,

76
00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:49.510
I'm assuming you can guess
what capital O does.

77
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.979
Yes, it takes your current line,
shifts it down,

78
00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.459
respects indenting and
puts you into insert mode.

79
00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:01.232
That is also glorious, all right,
I use it all the time, and probably are my

80
00:05:01.232 --> 00:05:05.931
most frequently used ways to go into
insert mode and then maybe capital A and

81
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:11.760
then eventually I, but I don't use I all
that often in comparison to the rest.

82
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.119
All right, so play around for a second
kind of feel it make sure you kind of

83
00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:21.050
understand, at least have the mental model
that i goes on this side of the cursor,

84
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.570
a goes on this side of the cursor.

85
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.881
I capitalize goes on
this side of the line,

86
00:05:25.881 --> 00:05:28.310
A capitalize goes on
this side of the line.

87
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.027
Awesome, so that's insert mode,

88
00:05:30.027 --> 00:05:33.820
I didn't give you an exhaustive list
cause I don't wanna do too much.

89
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.532
This is effectively the basic commands,

90
00:05:36.532 --> 00:05:41.980
at this point you could be equivalent
in editing text as you are today.

91
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.686
You might be pretty slow because
you don't know all the commands,

92
00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:45.760
they don't feel normal.

93
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.314
They don't feel natural, but this is kind
of like the minimum bar, and this is why

94
00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:54.605
them gets that super steep an initial
curve is because when you're doing it.

95
00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:59.465
You have to kind of know so
much Just even basically at a text, and

96
00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:04.320
that can be extremely daunting for
a lot of people.

97
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.027
I know it's overwhelming for
those that are brand new,

98
00:06:07.027 --> 00:06:10.320
this is probably a lot of information,
but let's just keep going.

99
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.133
All right, we're gonna keep going, we're
gonna just keep on shoving in information

100
00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:14.490
until we feel like we're gonna explode.

101
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.087
It's kind of like college,
just not as fun, all right, awesome,

102
00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.920
let's get out of this and let's go down.

103
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.672
All right, we've already kind of
recap we've done most of this,

104
00:06:25.672 --> 00:06:27.320
I did sneak ZZ in there.

105
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.241
I wasn't actually going to shows easy
at all because I don't use it ever and

106
00:06:31.241 --> 00:06:33.918
there's a reason why you
don't have to use it, but

107
00:06:33.918 --> 00:06:37.170
I thought it would be a lot of fun
to just kind of make it happen.

108
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.425
That's 16 total motions that I showed you,
there's a lot of motions,

109
00:06:40.425 --> 00:06:42.990
there's a lot of things
to keep in your head.

110
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.850
Today, you will likely
have to remind yourself,

111
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.160
I want to move down, what do I press?

112
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.488
I press J, hopefully we can conquer J and
K, number one, and

113
00:06:51.488 --> 00:06:54.310
then hopefully you can
conquer some other things.

114
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.965
And also looking at my list I realized
I forgot to put in U for Undo,

115
00:06:57.965 --> 00:07:01.160
which means I actually
showed you 17 commands.

116
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.590
I just didn't even remember it myself,
I know fun times for everybody.
