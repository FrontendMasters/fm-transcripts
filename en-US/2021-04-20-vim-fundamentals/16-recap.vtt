1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.180
All right, so let's keep going.

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.620
So I've showed you the Jumplist.

3
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.190
I've showed you Alternate file.

4
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.450
It's pretty cool, right?

5
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.210
There is a lot of navigation
that is available.

6
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.610
But none of that is quite
as good as a fuzzy Finder.

7
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.420
So we probably need to do
something about that, right?

8
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.034
But before we do that, we are going
to take a quick pit stop right here,

9
00:00:21.034 --> 00:00:24.772
just kind of talk about everything to
kind of go over all the things we've

10
00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:26.110
learned, right?

11
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.455
If anyone has any thoughts or questions
about just like general motion navigation,

12
00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:32.250
meaning within a file.

13
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.860
Anyways, so
one thing that always kind of was hard for

14
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.280
me at first was just hopping
efficiently between the modes.

15
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.830
One thing I would recommend is you can try
remapping your capslock key to Escape.

16
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.020
I've heard people like that a bunch.

17
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.490
So being able to switch really
quick out has been fantastic.

18
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.750
So I started using Ctrl + C to swap out,
because Ctrl + C was really nice.

19
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.669
It was really easy.

20
00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:58.200
A common one that I see all the time
were kind of in the rift zone right now.

21
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.091
So, we're riffing.

22
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.170
So who knows what's gonna happen out here?

23
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.060
All right, I'm gonna edit this and
I've seen this all the time.

24
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.660
I personally don't like it,
but I know people like it.

25
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.740
So Glinoremap,.jk, and
then go, &lt;esc&gt; Ctrl + c.

26
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.010
All right, that's it.

27
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.880
So, I'm gonna remap jk
while in insert mode

28
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.260
to actually become the Escape key instead.

29
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.690
So, let's just shout it out.

30
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.610
I could type that or
I remember I can just do space + Enter.

31
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.730
Boom, did it.

32
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.560
Now I'm over here typing then I go,
jk, I'm out.

33
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.200
I'm back into normal mode, right?

34
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.180
So I have now made it into what I want.

35
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.870
Some people use jj.

36
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.626
So that way, I wouldn't suggest jj.

37
00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:39.300
Abrams, that's way too long.

38
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.550
But one thing that's nice about that
is you can just start scrolling, right?

39
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.350
And it will just start doing it for you.

40
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.620
But notice that you get that weird offset.

41
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.120
It's why I don't like it
is when you type a j.

42
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.250
It like trips me up for a second because
the j appears after my cursor and

43
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.990
I'm like, my brain just can't handle that.

44
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.357
That's why I usually don't
like those type of remaps.

45
00:01:57.357 --> 00:01:58.390
And it also feels funny.

46
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.202
I like to just try to use as many
default vim bindings as I can,

47
00:02:01.202 --> 00:02:03.020
unless if they're terrible.

48
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.474
And so, executing Vex,
I'm fine having that as a remap,

49
00:02:06.474 --> 00:02:08.460
because that's just a command.

50
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.620
I type it in, it's slow.

51
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.070
Or I can make it into my own personal one.

52
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.798
But Escape is just Escape or
Ctrl + c is just Ctrl + c,

53
00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:16.389
I can get used to that, right?

54
00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.950
And so
that's kind of my general approach there.

55
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.042
All right, the Vim RC.

56
00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:22.200
So we do know a little bit about it.

57
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.387
We do know that Vim will, that language
we're using to describe the changes to our

58
00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:29.030
Vim RC and what we want to have happen.

59
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.330
It's kind of ugly.

60
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.970
Okay, we can all be honest with ourselves.

61
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.700
It's a weird looking language.

62
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.700
It has a lot of Vinism built into it,
cuz it's a language for an editor.

63
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.710
It's generally pretty hard to learn.

64
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.790
And there's, it only has one use case,
making them stuff, right?

65
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.140
And so I know a lot of people
that just tend to avoid it.

66
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.220
I recommend learning enough.

67
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.854
Is there any, I don't think there will be
any questions about what we've done so

68
00:02:53.854 --> 00:02:56.440
far, but if there is,
please throw it in the chat.

69
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.927
I hear your five seconds delayed or

70
00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:03.400
speak now forever hold your peace
inside of the Zoom meeting.

71
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.000
But here's the deal.

72
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.190
Don't be asking questions
that haven't existed yet.

73
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.480
Someone's gonna be like, well,
how do you make functions?

74
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.110
I'm like, no, no, no.

75
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.640
There is like a gy cursor somewhere or
another I forget exactly what it is.

76
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.647
I have it in mind enrc horn Vex enrc.

77
00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:19.445
Sorry, we don't have any of the,

78
00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:22.367
I don't have any my normal
navigations open right now.

79
00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:26.084
But if I'm not mistaken,
it's under my sets, gy cursor equals, so

80
00:03:26.084 --> 00:03:30.000
I'm gonna take that,
I'm gonna yank it into a special register.

81
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
As you can see right there,
I did an extra couple commands.

82
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.340
And so now I should be able to do that,
awesome.

83
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.403
So now let's Vim this and
I do, no, where to go?

84
00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:42.450
Anyways, I think it was said gy cursor.

85
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.630
I believe that's the one I did.

86
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.080
So let's shout that out.

87
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.310
Now when I go into insert mode,
it remains thick.

88
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.470
I actually really liked
the thick looking cursor.

89
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.520
It's just like something
I've gotten pretty used to.

90
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.390
Some people don't like that at all.

91
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.340
I don't know why,
it's just like super comforting to me.

92
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.450
Yeah, I just it's so great.

93
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.830
Anyways, there you go.

94
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.270
I hope that answers the question.

95
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.219
I kinda guessed a little bit what
that question was meaning, but

96
00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.300
anyways, there we go.

97
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.434
So there are so many things.

98
00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:11.013
You can also,

99
00:04:11.013 --> 00:04:14.270
like I said just google it cuz who
would have guessed gy cursor, right?

100
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.271
And if you would have opened
up a help options, and

101
00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:20.774
then started typing the word cursor in,
trying to look for

102
00:04:20.774 --> 00:04:25.580
the word cursor, you're gonna just be,
I don't know which one to do, right?

103
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.440
It's just way too many options.

104
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.280
It would have been very
very difficult to find it.

105
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.670
You could have also done help cursor and
then tried to like tab completed.

106
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.780
Maybe you would have found it.

107
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.360
You'd have to guess
which one it's gonna be.

108
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.392
But as you can see, there's just so
many options, right?

109
00:04:41.392 --> 00:04:44.350
I saw one that said parole,
that sounds dangerous.

110
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.580
I just stay away from that at all costs.

111
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.330
All right, final navigation.

112
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.322
So, there's some options,
marks are pretty awesome, but

113
00:04:52.322 --> 00:04:55.090
they're hard to use file tree,
bit lacking, right?

114
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.240
You kinda wish you had some extra
features in this file tree.

115
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.558
But that telescope,
was that a pretty cool fuzzy finder?

116
00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:06.440
The best part about that telescope one
is it's not just simply a file finder.

117
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.930
You can pipe any table,
any list of entries to it.

118
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.784
It can fuzzy find, it can send a quick fix
list, it can do a whole set of things that

119
00:05:13.784 --> 00:05:17.320
you can keep on iterating on it,
and it can even hold state.

120
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.720
You can also have your own custom remaps
with it, it's actually quite incredible.

121
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.816
All right, we got two questions.

122
00:05:21.816 --> 00:05:24.660
It looks like, or
just two fingers up for one question.

123
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.220
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to do
multiselection in Vim?

124
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.210
&gt;&gt; So multi cursors,
I assume this is what we're talking about.

125
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.399
So there is a couple ways you can sort
of accomplish that in Vim multi cursors,

126
00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:39.130
is always one of the,
just the chief questions.

127
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.393
I am gonna throw this out there
that I know, I'm gonna get some,

128
00:05:42.393 --> 00:05:43.970
gonna catch some flack for it.

129
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.140
I'm ready.

130
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.210
Multicursors are an anti-pattern.

131
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.290
They solve a particular problem and

132
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.041
you often have to shoehorn other
than like say simple renaming.

133
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:56.000
Simple renaming you can do a find and
replace.

134
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.930
You can also execute macros over it.

135
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.552
There's also a G command
that's incredible with it,

136
00:06:00.552 --> 00:06:04.549
where you can actually execute whole set
of editor commands on matching patterns.

137
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.572
Anything that involves you
selecting things like that I just

138
00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:12.795
feel is it's always most,
it's there for renames, right?

139
00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:15.670
But anything complex,
it completely breaks down.

140
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.731
Say you wanted to take an if statement and
switch it into a case

141
00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:23.115
statement using cursors would be terrible,
cuz you'd end up like writing over some of

142
00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:26.460
it over here because you have to
use a specific amount of editing.

143
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.090
And so that's why I've never found
them to be like the real solution.

144
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.560
They're just a simple solution
that works 80% of the time.

145
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.821
So we're gonna cover macros here soon, and

146
00:06:35.821 --> 00:06:38.420
I'll even go over the G
command a little bit.

147
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.762
It's a little crazy, but

148
00:06:39.762 --> 00:06:43.310
it is definitely what I would consider
the better of the two options.
