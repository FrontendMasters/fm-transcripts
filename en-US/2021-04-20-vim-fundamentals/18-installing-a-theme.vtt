00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.730
We're looking good, we're feeling good,
let's do this, right?

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.641
We now know some plugins.

3
00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:08.500
But here's one problem,
my color scheme is disgusting.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.060
We should do something about it.

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.693
So let's do what any reasonable person,
it's so

6
00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:20.945
bright, we should do is type in
AYU color scheme Vim, right?

7
00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:24.784
AYU color scheme VIM, I'm gonna have the
world's smallest font so no one can read.

8
00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:26.295
I'm gonna now zoom into here.

9
00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:28.928
I actually have Vim installed
on my browser as well, so

10
00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.690
I can just press F, and
then it'll give me all the links.

11
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.900
And I can press K, boom,
mouseless navigation, right?

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.670
J and K and D and U, it's fantastic,
right, it just works.

13
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.309
Anyways, there is AYU.

14
00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.340
AYU is beautiful, so what am I gonna do?

15
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.590
I'm gonna jump up to the bar up there and
I'm gonna highlight everything but

16
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.635
github.com, so ayu-theme, ayu-vim.

17
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.980
I'm gonna copy it, jump back in here.

18
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.580
I'm gonna press Shift+O, go in here,
do Plug, single quote ayu this, do that.

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.770
I'm gonna source my file.

20
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.170
And now I'm gonna do plug install.

21
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.850
Notice we've just installed it, awesome.

22
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.618
Now I'm gonna jump in here and
go to colorscheme and hit Ctrl+D.

23
00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:15.470
You should now see, my goodness,
AYU, you're right here.

24
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.850
Now you're over there,
you're actually right here, wow, crazy.

25
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.530
It's right there, so I'm gonna go ayu,
I'm gonna hit Enter.

26
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.840
And for whatever reason, it looks like
it actually didn't load that well.

27
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.823
That seems a little bit strange,
colorscheme ayu.

28
00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:32.540
Looks like it's actually breaking for
whatever reason, this feels unfortunate.

29
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.655
Nothing like a live demo.

30
00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:35.743
I actually didn't plan on doing this, but

31
00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:40.110
I just thought it would be fun to do on
the fly, have a little fun on the fly.

32
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.157
Is there any sort of requirements?

33
00:01:41.157 --> 00:01:44.020
So let's go down, let's leave out of here.

34
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.794
And let's go down and see if there's
any installation requirements.

35
00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:52.890
Doesn't look like there's any
installation requirements.

36
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.550
I'm confused as to why that's doing,
look at this, set term colors.

37
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.330
We don't have that.

38
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.195
All right, so let's make sure we actually
just cut and paste all of these.

39
00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:05.590
And make sure we just have
them inside of our Vim stuff.

40
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.010
So boom, I'm gonna cut and paste it,
we're gonna go back here, do this.

41
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.283
We're gonna go all the way down to here
and I'm just gonna paste them in, and

42
00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:13.219
I want dark, right?

43
00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.850
I'm gonna use the dark one,
I'm assuming this is the one we want.

44
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.120
I'm gonna hit Save, I'm gonna source it.

45
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.530
And my goodness, look at how much
better this is already looking.

46
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.280
This is a thing of beauty.

47
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.954
By the way, read the friendly manual,
that's what they keep telling me.

48
00:02:26.954 --> 00:02:28.590
Should have done in the first place.

49
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.350
And now look, now it's beautiful, wow.

50
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.857
Anyways, the term colors allow for
true 24 bit colors.

51
00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:38.894
AYU obviously dark, I want the dark theme,
I don't want the light theme.

52
00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:43.015
I appreciate my retinas long term, and
color scheme, I set it to right here.

53
00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:47.098
And so now that it's inside of my vimrc,
when I quit, and

54
00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:51.949
I reopen it back up, it's just
we're seeing these nice oranges and

55
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.030
greens and things feel a little bit nicer.

56
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.600
You can choose other color schemes,
they have pretty much every one of them.

57
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.441
Groovebox probably being my chief
of favorites at this point,

58
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:04.550
but AYU's a close second.

59
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.163
I know there's like Monokai if you
wanna look like a Sublime editor,

60
00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:08.026
if I'm not mistaken.

61
00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:11.943
And Dracula,
people always seem to love Dracula.

62
00:03:11.943 --> 00:03:13.940
Anywho, I'm getting yeses right now.

63
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.102
Yes, Dracula, that's the one,
I like purple.

64
00:03:17.102 --> 00:03:20.075
I don't really like purple that much,
I'm just not a purple guy.

65
00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:23.870
Anywho, so there we go,
we have everything fantastically set.

66
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.350
You now kinda get the idea
of how plugins work.

67
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.160
You find a plugin that's
what you want it to do.

68
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.135
Then you read the friendly manuals,
see how to do it, how to install it.

69
00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:36.550
Do the copying,
pasting into the plug section.

70
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.976
Any extra configuration needed
below the plug section, install it,

71
00:03:40.976 --> 00:03:46.210
rerun Vim, and almost always everything
will work fantastically smooth.

72
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.801
That's kind of how you start
to make Vim into your own.

73
00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:51.920
Cuz already, our Vim is already a much
better experience at this point.

74
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.938
If I were to come in here and
this is how we started, I mean,

75
00:03:53.938 --> 00:03:55.358
think about how much faster we can move.

76
00:03:55.358 --> 00:03:58.510
We can move way, way,
way faster than what we were.

77
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.830
And now you have a bunch of other tools,
alternate file, you have jump list,

78
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.550
which is gonna be fantastic.

79
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.660
That is pretty nice, right?

80
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.330
I'm actually jumping into separate files.

81
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.500
I'm jumping into my vimrc, cuz I'm just
using my previous jump list as I went.

82
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.430
So it's pretty fantastic.
