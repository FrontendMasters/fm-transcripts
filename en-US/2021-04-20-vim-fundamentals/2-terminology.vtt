00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.980
We're gonna go into terminology, so
it's a little bit different, right?

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.919
Some of the things I'm gonna say
might mean something to you, but

3
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.870
they might not mean the same
thing inside of them.

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.470
For fun up here,
I actually linked something right here.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.371
If you have the time at some point, check
out this video it's actually how files

6
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.831
work it's by Live Overflow,
pretty fantastic.

7
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.774
But just because I say the word file,

8
00:00:21.774 --> 00:00:24.845
it might not mean the same thing
to me as it does to you just so

9
00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:29.100
you know, but I'm gonna try to go over
everything that will work for both of us.

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.270
All right, so what is a buffer?

11
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.900
A buffer, some people will probably say is
a node class that contains ones and zeros.

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.440
You're right, not in this context,
but you're definitely right.

13
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.385
A buffer in VIM is effectively how I like
to think of it is a representation of

14
00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:45.670
the file in memory.

15
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.977
If you edit that buffer, it does not
mean you edit the file directly,

16
00:00:48.977 --> 00:00:50.640
you're editing a buffer.

17
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.971
When you write the buffer, you
are writing that buffer to the file and

18
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:57.480
replacing it with whatever
the contents is inside of the buffer.

19
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.370
You can do help buffer, I'm gonna
try to drill this in all the time.

20
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.391
There is a help menu for
literally everything and

21
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:08.260
so if I were to jump in here and
go help buffer.

22
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.229
It will give me a bunch of stuff
about buffers, commands I can do,

23
00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.284
all sorts of stuff so
it is completely available, remember that.

24
00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:20.065
A window, a window is simply
something that displays a buffer.

25
00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:24.636
Now that is pretty much all it is,
you can close a window and the underlying

26
00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:29.650
buffer can remain in memory but
the windows closed you no longer see it.

27
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.711
Tabs are like another viewport, it's
not like a tab in VS Code where we have

28
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:36.040
a bunch of little files opened as tabs.

29
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.425
Tab is another kind of viewport into VIM,
you can have multiple windows into it,

30
00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:41.971
you can have a lot of splits,

31
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:45.726
it's a separate workspace as I've
heard some people refer to it as.

32
00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:50.139
I personally am not a tab guy,
I try to get into tabs, [SOUND] it just,

33
00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:54.950
[SOUND] I really want them to workout,
but I just ended up just hating them.

34
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.723
You can definitely explore them see
how they feel see what they're like.

35
00:01:57.723 --> 00:02:02.410
A split, is simply just splitting
a window that's all it is.

36
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.449
I can kind of show you a couple of
these splits really quickly, so

37
00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:09.220
if I were to type in the word new,
I actually create a brand new buffer.

38
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.059
Now this thing is split horizontally,

39
00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:13.630
you can tell it's split
horizontally by the way it is.

40
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.550
In other words,
the line is the direction that determines

41
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.270
what type of split this is, so
this is a horizontal split.

42
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.315
If I were to do vino,
it would split it vertically, so

43
00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:25.900
this is a brand new
buffer up this direction.

44
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.368
It's a brand new buffer on this
side that is split vertically,

45
00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:32.960
it's by the line, remember that.

46
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.276
So every application seems to
do it a little bit differently,

47
00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:40.547
I think i3 my Window Manager has vertical
split the opposite of what it is VIM you

48
00:02:40.547 --> 00:02:42.110
just gotta learn what it is.

49
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.100
So just remember it's the lines
the direction of the line.

50
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.945
And here's some other terminology that
I think is really important, which is,

51
00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:52.310
I'll just click into this and
we'll just put it up here.

52
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.474
All right, so right up here,
these are tabs, so

53
00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:59.930
if you had tabs open you would
see up here a couple tabs, right?

54
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.792
These along the side are line numbers,

55
00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:04.200
you should be fairly
familiar with line numbers.

56
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.307
The current line you're on is gonna have
some sort of extra highlighting to it,

57
00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:10.380
it could display the line number.

58
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.536
I have a unique setting right here that
makes my line numbers look really goofy,

59
00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:15.720
we'll talk about that
here in a little bit.

60
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.320
The blinking square is your cursor, that's
where your current editing positions at.

61
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.630
This big old dark space right
here is called assigned column.

62
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.781
You can have it dynamically toggle on and
off, it can show errors,

63
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:33.250
it can show if you've edited
it in the gitgutter, right?

64
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.550
But in the end,
that's just called the signed column.

65
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.240
There's also down at the bottom
what file you're currently editing.

66
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.018
And along with that,
also your command bar, or

67
00:03:42.018 --> 00:03:46.890
it will show you what mode you're in
if you're in a mode that has a display.

68
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.456
Now we'll talk about modes and
all that here shortly.

69
00:03:50.456 --> 00:03:54.010
Can I get out of this thing, there we go.

70
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.367
And lastly, there's also what is called
the color column over here on this side.

71
00:03:57.367 --> 00:04:02.162
The color column is something you can or
don't have to have on, the color column is

72
00:04:02.162 --> 00:04:05.865
simply just a way to mark a certain
line number as being too far.

73
00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:08.166
You probably have seen
this in other editors,

74
00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:12.414
I set mine to 80 some people I've met 120,
set it whatever you want it just it just

75
00:04:12.414 --> 00:04:14.660
is a good way to indicate
how far over you are.
