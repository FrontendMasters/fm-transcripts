00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.060
So there is a Help menu, like I said,
you could always just type in help,

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.660
it will try to get you into
the best place colon help.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.690
If you find yourself lost,

4
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.200
read the friendly manual as they
keep telling me over and over again.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.010
I believe that's what rtfm stands for.

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.590
I'm pretty sure it's
read the friendly manual.

7
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.442
A motion is anything
that moves your cursor.

8
00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:26.060
This is taken straight
out of the help document.

9
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.580
So anytime my cursor moves, I have
performed what is referred to as a motion.

10
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.600
I know that's a little bit weird,
but it is what it is.

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.412
There's also gonna be some weird
abbreviations that I'll use from

12
00:00:36.412 --> 00:00:37.870
time to time.

13
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.358
One like ctrl+a, I'll abbreviate
it like this, which probably looks

14
00:00:42.358 --> 00:00:47.690
a little bit funny where it has a capital
&lt;C- a&gt; and it has brackets around it.

15
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.043
The reason why I will be
abbreviating everything like that,

16
00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:54.853
is that vim has its own editor language
that you can kind of set it up and

17
00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:59.480
make it the way you want, and that's
how you actually type it in the editor.

18
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.562
So just to kind of make it so
it's easier to remember, I

19
00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:07.192
will always be saying it properly, but it
will be displayed as C- a for control a.

20
00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:10.258
Enter is abbreviated as &lt;CR&gt;
carriage return, I believe, or

21
00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:12.549
maybe it's something completely different.

22
00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.093
But I just always say carriage return,
tab, escape, space, you can actually just

23
00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:21.130
display them as these little bracketed
characters space, escape, tab.

24
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.989
And when you see anything
that starts with a colon,

25
00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:27.787
it means it is a command, all right?

26
00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.680
And you'll get more
familiar with these things.

27
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.610
Honestly they'll get
easier as time goes on.

28
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.552
I just want to make sure that at least
we cover the language I will use, so

29
00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:38.270
it feels easier for everyone.

30
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.410
All right, so
I hope everyone here is ready.

31
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.790
I'm very excited,
I hope everyone else is really excited.

32
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.160
I just love the experience.

33
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.669
I know that's kinda seems silly, but

34
00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:51.130
it's just something that I just
can't stand how great it is.

35
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.470
And when I learned something new,
it feels exciting.

36
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.710
Because I'm like learning something that's
gonna make my day to day life better.

37
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.950
I'm gonna be faster,
I'm gonna have better understanding.

38
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.462
In fact, it's just magical to me.

39
00:02:03.462 --> 00:02:07.440
But, do we have a question over here?

40
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.751
What kind of development can we do and
then, and is it better suited for

41
00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:11.660
some than others?

42
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.009
Well, here's the deal that I like
to kind of operate with Vim,

43
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.720
is everything but JDK.

44
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.409
That's my general kind of rule,
is that IntelliJ is just so good,

45
00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.625
when it comes to working with Java, or
any of the kind of JDK environment.

46
00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:29.615
But I tend to use it just for that, even
though niobium has a lot of tools that

47
00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.380
are being developed and
it's getting better all the time.

48
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.170
It's just hard to compete with
IntelliJ on that one aspect.

49
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.948
For me any language that has
a language server and LSP,

50
00:02:39.948 --> 00:02:44.320
a language server protocol,
if it has that, Vim can use that.

51
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.693
Every major thing has plugins
that will give you autocomplete,

52
00:02:47.693 --> 00:02:50.640
they'll give you jump definition,
find references.

53
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.671
It has everything that
every other editor has,

54
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:56.700
they're just usually formed in plugins.

55
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.001
So Vim itself won't
have them specifically,

56
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:01.900
it'll have some built in ways
you can do them via c tags.

57
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.050
I won't cover c tags,
they're largely defeated due to lsps.

58
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.411
There's some still some use cases for
Vim, but in the end, vim can be used for

59
00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:10.720
pretty much anything.

60
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.966
But like I said, generally recommended for
Java or a generally recommend something

61
00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:19.290
else for Java, just cuz of how complex
it is, just better experience, right?

62
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.281
But I do wanna remind everyone,
this is a journey,

63
00:03:22.281 --> 00:03:26.620
it's not a day trip, this class is
gonna be over some set of hours.

64
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.790
But to be good at Vim,
you can't get good in a day.

65
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.940
You can't get good at virtually
anything with a computer in a day.

66
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.810
You have to look at it
as a long term item.

67
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.400
And the hard part about Vim is
that the journey is uphill.

68
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.561
Just like when you first learned
your first language on a computer,

69
00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:45.446
if you've been developing for a while,

70
00:03:45.446 --> 00:03:48.285
if you remember that moment of
how confusing and hard it was.

71
00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:52.975
Cuz you're both learning the syntax and
what the syntax means at the same time,

72
00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:55.717
it's really hard, those first little bits.

73
00:03:55.717 --> 00:03:57.280
And it's just like that with Vim.

74
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.599
It is hard to begin with, because you're
just trying to reprogram your brain to do

75
00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.560
something that feels really unintuitive,
right?

76
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.290
It feels normal to go,
I wanna go to this part of this code.

77
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.704
So I'm gonna use my mouse, I'm gonna
scroll down, I'm gonna highlight and

78
00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:14.976
select it, and I'm gonna copy it with
Ctrl C, like you're used to that.

79
00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:19.050
That makes sense, because that's
what's always around, it's momentum.

80
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.472
But Vim offers a completely new way,
and it's just different, but trust me,

81
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.280
it's way better.

82
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.340
And the last part is the top of
the mountain, it's awesome, right?

83
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.870
Like any good journey,
the top of the mountain is incredible.

84
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.240
And I may be at the top of the mountain
right now, but I'm still only halfway up,

85
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.750
and so, don't ever stop.

86
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.340
Yes, I did just quote Dr. Disrespect,
let it happen, but the deal is that,

87
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.570
even though I feel like I'm at the top,
I never want to stop that desire to learn.

88
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.937
That desire to think that there's
still more even if I can't see it,

89
00:04:52.937 --> 00:04:55.970
there's still more out there,
and I don't want to stop now.

90
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.827
Like I said, for the live class,
I do stream on Twitch, asking questions,

91
00:05:00.827 --> 00:05:01.990
those kind of things.

92
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.076
You're not gonna confuse me,
you're not gonna stop me,

93
00:05:04.076 --> 00:05:06.000
I'm not gonna get my
train of thought lost.

94
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.240
If you have stuff and
I do question part, feel free.

95
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.590
Trust me, it's only gonna help people,
it's not gonna hurt me.

96
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.446
And there's really no dumb questions
about Vim, cuz Vim it's just so

97
00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:19.490
much different than your standard thing,
that everything feels new and unique.

98
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.980
I also have some Github projects set up.

99
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.350
So the first one is this Vim fundamentals.

100
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.278
You can click through that, I believe
we can get the actual link in the chat,

101
00:05:30.278 --> 00:05:33.138
that will be for
the Github project itself.

102
00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:36.690
But there's also gonna be a second
one called Vim nav playground.

103
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.696
That one you should clone down,
I will have another spot where I say, hey,

104
00:05:39.696 --> 00:05:41.100
everyone, let's clone it down.

105
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.672
But just so know, get ready to
jump on Github, clone it down,

106
00:05:44.672 --> 00:05:48.800
it'll be very useful if you follow
along and do the actions with me.

107
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.920
You don't have to, but once again,
you're not even walking on that,

108
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.970
you're not even taking the day trip.

109
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.360
We got a long way to go, so
just follow along if you can.

110
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.285
And lastly, we need to clean
the environment, meaning that,

111
00:06:01.285 --> 00:06:06.610
if you use Vim now, we want to remove
everything that you've set custom in Vim.

112
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.860
And I'll go over that here shortly, okay?

113
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.460
Yes, so the question is, is like,
am I gonna map out what's kind of in Vim?

114
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.040
I know there's plugins, but
also what about like Vim specific items?

115
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.891
Earlier I did talk about how I started by
learning just the motions and IntelliJ,

116
00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:23.830
we're gonna kind of take
an inverse approach to this.

117
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.810
In other words, we're gonna learn about
Vim and I'll show you some motions.

118
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.232
I'll show you how to use them, I'll show
you how to walk around, but we're gonna

119
00:06:31.232 --> 00:06:34.675
learn the components of Vim, and also how
to use them or change them with plugins.

120
00:06:34.675 --> 00:06:36.769
So we're gonna hopefully cover everything.

121
00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:39.885
I haven't tried using many of
the Vim plugins in VS code.

122
00:06:39.885 --> 00:06:43.597
In general, how I think about it, is
that VS code has its own environment and

123
00:06:43.597 --> 00:06:47.831
has its own plugins, its own methodology,
its own way, besides for the Vim motions,

124
00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:49.055
which is very valuable.

125
00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:50.675
It's a great stepping stone.

126
00:06:50.675 --> 00:06:54.539
Like if you want to get into Vim, but
you're like, holy cow, when I open it,

127
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.130
I have no idea what's happening, I get it.

128
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.388
A great place to start, which is the place
I started, use my favorite editor,

129
00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:02.840
use Vim mode.

130
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.635
Get familiar, become as productive
with just using the keyboard, and

131
00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:08.720
then I made the jump myself.

132
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.797
I actually became more productive
using the keyboard, and eventually,

133
00:07:11.797 --> 00:07:12.500
I made the jump.

134
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.994
I also stopped programming Java at
that point, and started doing C++, and

135
00:07:15.994 --> 00:07:19.680
TypeScript, and other languages, and
it works fantastic for all those.

136
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.416
And so that's kind of like the general,
I'd say recommended approach,

137
00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:26.428
because there's so many options,
and because there's so

138
00:07:26.428 --> 00:07:29.339
many great editors out there that have so
many features.

139
00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:33.010
It just makes sense, we live in
a world where Vim is off to the side.

140
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.971
So, totally start with the plug in,
and slowly make the transition,

141
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:39.265
if you even want to make the transition.

142
00:07:39.265 --> 00:07:40.241
If you don't,

143
00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:45.290
the editing speed gain you will get by
just learning Vim motions is incredible.

144
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:51.694
There's so many things you can do at
such crazy rates, it's straight bananas.

145
00:07:51.694 --> 00:07:52.330
That's a good question.

146
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.830
So the question is, all right,
so there's a lot to learn.

147
00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.730
Even just me saying the terminology, some
people are like, okay, what was the thing?

148
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.140
Well, there's a lot to it,
there's a lot of stuff to learn, and

149
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.380
it can definitely feel overwhelming.

150
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.393
Like I said my first hour of using Vim,

151
00:08:09.393 --> 00:08:15.240
I swear I was gonna have a panic attack,
because I couldn't move as fast.

152
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.147
I just wanted to use the mouse,
I just wanted to do all these things,

153
00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:21.210
cuz it just didn't feel normal and
there's so much to remember.

154
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.835
And I had to think about
what I was going to do,

155
00:08:24.835 --> 00:08:30.578
instead of doing the thing I wanted to do,
and that is just very normal.

156
00:08:30.578 --> 00:08:34.068
Here's the deal,
just try to take it in slices.

157
00:08:34.068 --> 00:08:38.120
After today, you'll have a bunch
of ideas of what is available.

158
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.151
You may not be able to kind of codify
exactly what they are in your head, but

159
00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:46.898
what you can do, is simply re-watch apart,
or just take like say your basic motions,

160
00:08:46.898 --> 00:08:48.096
and get good at them.

161
00:08:48.096 --> 00:08:52.964
And then, just add a couple more motions
in, add a couple more emotions in,

162
00:08:52.964 --> 00:08:55.791
and then just slowly
get better at editing.

163
00:08:55.791 --> 00:09:00.008
And then, learn a little bit about this,
re-watch that, go read about it, and just

164
00:09:00.008 --> 00:09:04.190
take small steps, cuz if you try to do it
all at once, honestly you'll be confused.

165
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.230
It is kind of confusing
doing everything at once.

166
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.188
I like kind of progressive
learning approach, or

167
00:09:10.188 --> 00:09:15.020
I learned the basics and then just
slowly later on, a little bit at a time.

168
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.860
I think, honestly,
that is the best way to learn.
