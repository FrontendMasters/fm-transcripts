00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.510
I hope everyone enjoyed that,
is there any questions?

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.920
Was that kind of intense, probably
a lot of information there, does do.

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.800
Does everyone see the power of
quick fix list at least, right?

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.200
Do you see why they're so awesome?

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.440
What you can do with them.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.595
See, do, looks really cool,
hopefully you saw that one ha.

7
00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:20.690
I wonder what I with them, I didn't
really go over that because it's not,

8
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.745
probably worth,
it's not the right time yet anyways.

9
00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.981
We haven't kinda gone over
a lot of the commands, but

10
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:28.045
I just personally really liked that.

11
00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:30.775
So let's keep on going,
let's do search and replace, all right?

12
00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:35.500
Search and replace, allows you to be
able to do exactly what it sounds like.

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.395
And it's something that we just,
you kind of like need for

14
00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:38.420
every editor at this point.

15
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.300
It's kind of crazy not to have it, right.

16
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.090
It just doesn't feel like an editor.

17
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.350
It was in head,
head had search and replace.

18
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.450
So you bet you,
this has search and replace.

19
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.200
So we have another one
of these curl files.

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.454
I'm going to take it,
I'm going to cut and paste it and

21
00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:53.990
I'm going to put it into
the chat right now.

22
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.560
Please download it, let's do this, let's
do some searching and some replacing.

23
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.812
Now at this point,

24
00:00:59.812 --> 00:01:04.520
we're getting into kind of a lot of
these more advanced areas, right?

25
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.120
So this is kind of where VIM, we're really
kind of diving into more of the vim isms,

26
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.500
things that don't necessarily
exist in all editors.

27
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.780
Quick Fix list obviously don't
really exist in all editors.

28
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.000
But there we go, so
let's start with the searching.

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.910
Now if you use Neo-vim versus vim,
you may have different results.

30
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.385
Since I use Neo-vim it may act
differently than how your search and

31
00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:28.000
replace will work.

32
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.640
So let's find out, I believe I should be
able to like this set_nohls, there we go.

33
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.940
That should be, I believe this should be
the, that should be how vim should work.

34
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.990
So if you're using vim,
these now should line up approximately.

35
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.843
So let's start by searching for
the word error.

36
00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:46.890
How do you search in vim?

37
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.900
While you type in a slash, so if I go
slash, I'm now searching in this document.

38
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.950
As you can see, it's a forward slash.

39
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.000
And so I'm gonna type in error,
there we go.

40
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.096
Unfortunately, I still have
incremental search on,

41
00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:02.580
it's going to show me what
the first match that I find.

42
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.170
There we go, I have found it.

43
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.100
If I press n, it will jump to
the next one, that's, there we go.

44
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.477
See, as you can see, I'm pressing n and
it's jumping around,

45
00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:13.020
it'll eventually let me
know that I've hit the top.

46
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.110
And there we go, you can do capital N,
to walk backwards.

47
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.500
Alright, awesome, so
now we're just searching.

48
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.850
We can now set some commands.

49
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.647
Let's talk about some different commands
you can set, going to set hls and

50
00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:28.990
then also do set ic.

51
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.630
So I'm going to put them both
in a single set command.

52
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.390
What this will do, is this will set any
highlighted searches that we've done.

53
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.610
So my last search is
highlighted right now.

54
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.156
As you can see, it's just sitting,
we searched up air,

55
00:02:40.156 --> 00:02:42.320
there's all the spots that it existed.

56
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.240
If I start to retype error, you'll
see that it highlights it everywhere.

57
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.770
Here's all the places re exists.

58
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.140
Here's all the places that exists.

59
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.844
Here's error, and you can see it's
slowly going down and doing it.

60
00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:02.352
You can do more than just that type of
searching, you can add in regex is now

61
00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:07.108
here's the thing with regex is you got
to always go to regex licensing.org.

62
00:03:07.108 --> 00:03:10.917
You're gonna look on here and make sure
you have, you're gonna see that there's

63
00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:13.870
a lot of typical disasters with
regex is be careful with them.

64
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.326
And you're gonna check the citations and
make sure you haven't been cited for

65
00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:20.359
any illegal uses of regex,
is don't put them into production kids,

66
00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:21.800
terrible idea, awesome.

67
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.590
And by the way, I am on the warning list.

68
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.817
I'm on the No Fly regex list, so

69
00:03:24.817 --> 00:03:27.400
I'm kind of doing something a little
out of my bounds right now.

70
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.210
Please do not tell guy
that I've done this.

71
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.900
I will be in big trouble,
awesome, all right.

72
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.630
So I'm going to dot star, look at it.

73
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.648
It's matching everything,
right, then we do Or,

74
00:03:37.648 --> 00:03:39.990
you can see that it's matching across.

75
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.463
So incremental search is incredible,
because it shows you,

76
00:03:43.463 --> 00:03:46.310
how your search is
matching up in that file.

77
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.394
Highlight search or hls, not a big fan
personally, because after I've searched,

78
00:03:50.394 --> 00:03:52.850
I don't need all the things highlighted.

79
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.517
And if I want them to go away,

80
00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:58.800
I have to manually type in nohls
highlight search or have a remap.

81
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.680
I haven't done a remap,
I could do one, I could use this.

82
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.100
If I wanted to do that every single time,
not necessarily something I want to do,

83
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.270
but it is available.

84
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.070
All right, so,
let's do something a little bit different.

85
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.010
You can go and you can highlight
a region with V, do a visual mode.

86
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.080
And then, you can type in a colon.

87
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.970
It will give you a ranged search.

88
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.850
Now you can do a search and
replace on this.

89
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.600
You can just do a search on this.

90
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.010
I can do a sweet error search,
across only that visual region.

91
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.120
So here, let's tighten it up a little bit.

92
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.788
Here, let me undo that,
I'm gonna just do these two websites.

93
00:04:34.788 --> 00:04:40.340
I must have under, my goodness,
must have done that one wrong.

94
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.160
So let's just do this and let's just
make it a little bit more interesting.

95
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.980
Honestly, let's just
make it more interesting.

96
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.150
Let's search over a region, but
let's do a search and replace.

97
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.140
What can we do with the search and
replace?

98
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.629
Well, how it works is it just works like
it doesn't head, you do a search with

99
00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.557
s slash the token you're looking for slash
the token, you're going to replace it.

100
00:05:01.557 --> 00:05:04.825
So we can do the exact same thing here,
I can search for error, and

101
00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:08.809
then I can replace it with something else,
if you're doing a full file search,

102
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:09.718
you do percent s.

103
00:05:09.718 --> 00:05:13.909
If you're doing it over a visual range,
you first select that visual range, and

104
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.010
then do this and then do s and
it can do it over a visual range.

105
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.720
So there we go, I can start typing.

106
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.350
Here's the three places
that have found it.

107
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.970
I can replace it with AOEU,
which is my equivalent of your asdf.

108
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.880
And there we go, a replaced it but
notice something.

109
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.390
It only replaced one of them in this line.

110
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.540
It's pretty interesting, right?

111
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.600
So let's go down here, I kind of have some
stuff right in here to be able to do that.

112
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.900
We're going to do it,
let's do it right here.

113
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.230
Let's go all the way down to the foot
section and do the same thing.

114
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.870
But let's do it, best,
all right, I'm gonna,

115
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.350
I cannot sit on this line and
type it s slash foo.

116
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.707
And you'll see it highlights all undo bar,
right or bars,

117
00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:55.220
knows that only does
it one line at a time.

118
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.170
So I can redo up,
do it over and over again.

119
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.540
And notice how I'm executing that too.

120
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.790
If I do s slash,
it's on a single line, percent S, for

121
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.114
the whole file, or
if you have a visual range selected,

122
00:06:06.114 --> 00:06:10.140
it is tick opening bracket,
tick closing bracket, right?

123
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.048
And that's a visual range, all right, but
if we wanna be able to replace them all,

124
00:06:15.048 --> 00:06:18.140
and at the same time,
we can get to that line.

125
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.559
And we could do foo bar slash g, awesome,

126
00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:26.060
it'll go globally across
the line replace them.

127
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.842
This should be pretty familiar if
you've ever used any regex is,

128
00:06:28.842 --> 00:06:30.370
this should feel pretty familiar.

129
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.540
At this point,
you kinda know what that means.

130
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.370
We can go down even further and
do it again.

131
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.196
But this time let's do
a s slash foo bar gc,

132
00:06:40.196 --> 00:06:43.660
I showed you this earlier.

133
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.100
You can press a yes for
yes replace it or no, don't replace it.

134
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.790
So, I can go yes, no, yes, no,
there we go, I was able to find replace.

135
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.476
Yes, no, yes, no, so you do have a lot of
options when you're using the searching

136
00:06:55.476 --> 00:06:57.530
and the replacing, it's pretty fun.

137
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.850
Let me show you a little bit
the range one down here.

138
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:05.210
So let's say we want to do all the foos,
right here.

139
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.840
Well, I could just highlight them, right?

140
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.070
And then do s/foo/bar,
it only did it over my highlight.

141
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.764
I didn't have to worry about
the other foos in there.

142
00:07:16.764 --> 00:07:20.773
That's pretty nice, because you don't want
to necessarily always be searching or

143
00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:24.160
placing the entire file, or
just constrained to a single line.

144
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.800
You want to be able to kinda
select a region, right?

145
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.960
We've already talked about the full file,
it's awesome.

146
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.989
So full file, finding replace or
full project,

147
00:07:33.989 --> 00:07:39.184
I kind of alluded to it in quick fix, you
can use grepping across quick fixes and

148
00:07:39.184 --> 00:07:44.560
then use a C do, to be able to execute
certain, finding replaces on it globally.

149
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.221
So it acts very similar and then a write
all to be able to write all of them,

150
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:48.940
awesome.

151
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.670
So that's effectively finding replace.

152
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.714
Works with regex is, but

153
00:07:52.714 --> 00:07:55.218
let's add in something that
makes it a little bit more fun.

154
00:07:55.218 --> 00:08:01.380
Let's like this, if let's have a, term
in here, let's just call it foo for now.

155
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.470
I'm gonna take off highlighted searches.

156
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.010
So okay,
we're kind of off the script right now.

157
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.571
Let's just deal with it, right,
and what I want to do is,

158
00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:12.670
I want to be able to find and
replace this.

159
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.100
But let's go man,
you know what we did wrong.

160
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:20.200
We meant to find everything that,
we meant to search for falses right,

161
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.705
not trues but falses,
I'm gonna have to manually go in here and

162
00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:27.520
type in, not foo, not bar, not bass.

163
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.844
Obviously, if this was a long list,

164
00:08:28.844 --> 00:08:31.320
you'd first question
the person's programming talent.

165
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.351
But, instead we're just simply going
to go, okay, well let's find and

166
00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:37.950
replace this and do this better, right?

167
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:43.270
So one thing we could do, well,
we could try to go all right.

168
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:48.146
Well, there is this where I could go,
If space this and

169
00:08:48.146 --> 00:08:52.810
then all right, we can do that and
we can replace it.

170
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.419
Oops, I forgot to do it s slash, alright,

171
00:08:55.419 --> 00:09:00.520
we could replace it with if that bang,
awesome, okay, that works, right?

172
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.255
We did something kind of cool there,
we kind of replace something in there but,

173
00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:05.670
that's not as good, right?

174
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:10.325
We could do something better, let's try
to do something a little bit better and

175
00:09:10.325 --> 00:09:12.470
a little bit more confusing.

176
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:17.405
Alright, so let's do this again except for
let's take foo and bar or

177
00:09:17.405 --> 00:09:21.130
bar and bass, and bass and
foo and swap them.

178
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.940
So we can do this with fine, we can do
this with finding replace and regex.

179
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.000
So we're going to do this,
I'll highlight this region.

180
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.740
So it's just right here,
right now can find, my search space.

181
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.636
And what I'm going to do, is I'm going to
first look for a opening princely alright,

182
00:09:36.636 --> 00:09:37.660
we got it.

183
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:42.620
I call this the one I Kirby, you're
gonna go find norm, effectively you're

184
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.250
escaping a open parentheses then
you're going to do dot star.

185
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.514
Then you're going to do
a closing parentheses and

186
00:09:50.514 --> 00:09:54.040
then I'm going to do
a space ampere ampere.

187
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.864
Space, another one I Kirby, and

188
00:09:55.864 --> 00:10:00.290
then I'm going to do another
parentheses right here, so there we go.

189
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.194
So what I've effectively done,
is I've matched a group of characters, but

190
00:10:04.194 --> 00:10:07.190
I've put this escaped
parentheses around them.

191
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.872
What that tells my regex to do,

192
00:10:08.872 --> 00:10:13.110
is that not only should we find that
contiguous space of characters.

193
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.100
But also, I want to save it to a variable.

194
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.660
So now I'm going to do a slash.

195
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.150
And what I'll do is I'll go okay,
so let's see we had a parentheses.

196
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.060
I'm gonna do slash two and
slash one, right?

197
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.980
So slash two is the second match group,
slash one is the first match group.

198
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:36.100
So should go, bar foo, it should be
able to effectively swap, right?

199
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.540
So let's hit enter, there we go.

200
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.670
We kind of got it, but
my goodness, look what happened.

201
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.150
We totally got this wrong,
so what happened here?

202
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.090
Let's start playing with it, let's see if
we can kind of figure out what went wrong.

203
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.160
So we're gonna go back to this and
we're gonna press up, all right.

204
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.690
So let's start moving it back,
right, let's start walking it back.

205
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.241
So notice what's happening as I'm
writing this, if I just do this,

206
00:10:57.241 --> 00:11:00.710
you'll notice it highlights
the whole region.

207
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:05.160
Okay, well that's bad, so
maybe I had myself some bad escaped items.

208
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.010
Now, because this seems to be working,
right.

209
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:14.930
Why is it that dot star slash this,
why is it that this is not matching?

210
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.380
So you can type it in you see it,
and then maybe try something else.

211
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.260
What is one, okay, awesome, I must
have done something goofy there deny.

212
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.700
So, let's try it again, oops,
I just replaced it twice.

213
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.040
All right, let's try slash two,
know that also worked.

214
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.024
I bet you, that now that I've kind of
did a little bit of diagnostic thing,

215
00:11:35.024 --> 00:11:39.262
that the ampersand sign must have a
meaning I don't understand, look at that,

216
00:11:39.262 --> 00:11:41.630
it hasn't meaning I don't understand.

217
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.998
Okay, so if I wanted to replace this,

218
00:11:43.998 --> 00:11:48.200
I'm simply gonna do slash one
space slash ampere slash ampere.

219
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.530
You kind of have to experience
experiment with this slash two.

220
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.610
And I bet you this will actually work.

221
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.813
Don't forget to,
see I forgot to wrap it with,

222
00:11:55.813 --> 00:11:58.770
the rest of the stuff that we
matched in the previous one.

223
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.509
But as you see, I was able to flip them,

224
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:05.710
by typing them correctly by doing two and
one there we go.

225
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.964
I flipped them around, right,

226
00:12:06.964 --> 00:12:09.760
I know I had to do the other ampersand
science plus the squirrely brace.

227
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.110
We just didn't do it,
but you get the idea.

228
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:16.092
I'm able to kind of work with it, see what
happens, redo it over and over again and

229
00:12:16.092 --> 00:12:18.900
you can see how you can find and
replace with regexes.

230
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.333
Also, this is a great example of why
regexes are likely more confusing than you

231
00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:23.400
think they are.

232
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.680
They often don't act
the way you think they are.

233
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.710
You think you understand what they're
matching, and sometimes you're wrong.

234
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.387
You're over matching,
you're under matching or

235
00:12:30.387 --> 00:12:33.220
you're executing some unknown variable
that actually does something right.

236
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.020
Classic, \is the classic conundrum, right?
