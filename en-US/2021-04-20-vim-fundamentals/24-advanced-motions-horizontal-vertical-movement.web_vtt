00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.787
Let's go into some pretty advanced things.

2
00:00:02.787 --> 00:00:05.270
So this is where it gets kinda crazy.

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.473
Okay, we're gonna go see really
where the power of them actually is.

4
00:00:10.473 --> 00:00:15.520
So remember, just to recap,
remember how I talked about I/A.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.185
I goes on this side, A goes on this side.

6
00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:23.605
I is the inside A is
the outside they append,

7
00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:29.230
whatever the word is that A is used for
It's fantastic.

8
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.718
Remember, 5dd is equivalent of d4j, right.

9
00:00:32.718 --> 00:00:35.585
Because you are gonna delete
the line plus few others,

10
00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:38.077
you're gonna delete your
line plus 4 others or

11
00:00:38.077 --> 00:00:41.960
you're gonna delete your line and
go forward down and delete it, right?

12
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.451
So they're the same,
you can kinda see how you're doing this.

13
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:47.200
You can even do more
kind of composability.

14
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.207
You know how I talked about G, right?

15
00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:52.271
We keep talking about G, I can do dG, and

16
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:57.606
I've just deleted from my cursor all
the way down to the bottom right.

17
00:00:57.606 --> 00:01:00.642
That's pretty neat, so you can
always mess with someone do dgdG and

18
00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:02.090
delete the whole file, right?

19
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.262
It's all gone, but then I can just
press U it's back, fantastic, right?

20
00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:09.390
All right, so
let's go over the advanced motions.

21
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.404
So this is really where VIM shines.

22
00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:14.551
Okay, we've been using all
the slow commands effectively,

23
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:18.090
the only one that's actually
really fast is relative jumps.

24
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.920
I highly recommend them but for this case,
it's only one of the very fast motions.

25
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.860
So let's just look at
some advanced motion.

26
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.418
So copy and paste this down and
let's do this.

27
00:01:29.418 --> 00:01:30.256
Let's go over this.

28
00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.456
So, the first one,
we're gonna start with 'c', so

29
00:01:33.456 --> 00:01:36.770
I haven't even talked about 'c' at all.

30
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.082
'c' is the equivalent to 'd',
except for the only difference is,

31
00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:47.768
instead of deleting the line, you delete
the line and go into insert mode.

32
00:01:47.768 --> 00:01:51.077
So it's kind of like this extra bonus,

33
00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:55.602
meaning that if I were right here,
I could just go cc.

34
00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:58.144
And now not only did I
just delete that line,

35
00:01:58.144 --> 00:02:01.530
but as you can tell right here,
I'm in insert mode.

36
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.786
So it actually saves you a single
step of being able to jump right in.

37
00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:08.730
So that's pretty nice, right?

38
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.687
One thing that's hard about 'c',
is that 'c' is really hard to get into

39
00:02:13.687 --> 00:02:18.880
the habit of ,often I find myself
d-ing when I should have been c-ing.

40
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.187
It's just a kind of a natural thing
because I learned about 'c' so

41
00:02:22.187 --> 00:02:25.214
much later after 'd' that I
built up a lot of muscle memory.

42
00:02:25.214 --> 00:02:29.590
And so it took a long time for me to be
able to get to that point of doing it.

43
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.771
Now remember, 'c' works just the same way,
so if I did 'c' for

44
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:37.205
'j' I deleted five lines and
went into insert mode.

45
00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:41.073
So it's identical to 'd' except for
the insert at the end.

46
00:02:41.073 --> 00:02:47.504
It will also respect indents, If you're in
a file type that has inventing available.

47
00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:52.213
I don't know if it's going to respect
much of the indenting here because we

48
00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:52.969
are doing.

49
00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:57.220
Cuz I'm in an MD file and these don't
really have indent rules, right?

50
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.278
And so
there could be some difficulties here.

51
00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:01.750
All right, so let's first start
here with the horizontal movements.

52
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.039
So now we're gonna move into these.

53
00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.290
There's a whole bunch of other
horizontal movements that are available.

54
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.174
Let's kinda go over them one at a time.

55
00:03:08.174 --> 00:03:11.016
Now remember,
you don't have to be proficient at these,

56
00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:13.610
you don't even have to
remember all of them.

57
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.100
What you need to do is, you need to know
that there are other motions available,

58
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.388
a lot of editing motions in need at least
a way to be able to go find out what they

59
00:03:22.388 --> 00:03:24.820
are, or have some notion of what they are.

60
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.335
And so this is kind of the purpose of this
is that I'm showing you what's available,

61
00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:30.790
and you can decide on what's good for
yourself.

62
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.884
So I showed you earlier underscore which
takes you to the beginning of the line.

63
00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:36.494
If you have content online,

64
00:03:36.494 --> 00:03:40.420
it will take you to the beginning
of that content, right?

65
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.287
It doesn't go all the way
to the beginning,

66
00:03:42.287 --> 00:03:45.668
it just goes to the first non whitespace
character, whereas if you press zero,

67
00:03:45.668 --> 00:03:48.258
you will actually go all the way
to the beginning of the line.

68
00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:49.650
That's pretty cool right?

69
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.121
Dollar sign will go to
the end of the line.

70
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:55.492
You can also use carat to go
to the beginning of the line.

71
00:03:55.492 --> 00:03:58.396
There is a subtle difference with
underscore versus carat but for

72
00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:00.570
the most part don't even worry about it.

73
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.972
I just use underscore cuz honestly
underscore is way easier to type.

74
00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:06.783
I'm kinda gonna be flying through these
things because I want you just to know

75
00:04:06.783 --> 00:04:07.930
what's available.

76
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.469
And if you can keep up please do try
these things out because they actually

77
00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:12.348
are pretty cool.

78
00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:15.216
So capital D,
I did show you this earlier, but

79
00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:19.200
it deletes everything past
the cursor this direction, right?

80
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.288
Like it just keeps on going.

81
00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:22.980
Yeah, yeah, it is this direction, okay.

82
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.441
It deletes it,
all the way this way, right?

83
00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:30.432
And so from your cursor to the end of
the line, it is equivalent of doing d$.

84
00:04:30.432 --> 00:04:32.355
I just showed you what dollar does, right?

85
00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:36.360
So capital d, d$,
effectively the same thing.

86
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.959
You can do the same thing but
with c, right?

87
00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:42.314
So if I do shift c, not only do I delete
the contents, I go into insert mode at my

88
00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:47.560
characters position, I can start typing,
this actually is pretty darn fantastic.

89
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.663
Is really nice to have.

90
00:04:50.663 --> 00:04:52.732
S is just probably one
of my favorite ones.

91
00:04:52.732 --> 00:04:56.760
Capital S will delete the whole line,
respect indenting, and

92
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.170
go into insert mode.

93
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.368
So you can just simply delete that line
you're on and go right into insert mode.

94
00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:02.800
It is very, very nice.

95
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.970
Little s,
I bet you can maybe guess what it does.

96
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.586
Little s is just like x ,except for,
It goes into inset mode.

97
00:05:10.586 --> 00:05:15.537
Little s will delete that single
character, and then go into insert mode,

98
00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:16.959
yeah, pretty neat.

99
00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:20.656
I think it's pretty neat, it's also
really fast way to swap two characters,

100
00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:24.298
you do x s, type in the character that
you had before, escape, SHIFT+P, so

101
00:05:24.298 --> 00:05:25.326
it's the capital P.

102
00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:27.950
And there you go, blah, blah, blah,
I know that's a lot of things.

103
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.098
Just a quick xse Ctrl + c P, right?

104
00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:34.780
It's like that simple, right?

105
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.730
I mean, it's pretty neat, right?

106
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.387
I really like s, s was actually one
of the more first characters that I

107
00:05:41.387 --> 00:05:44.288
discovered I just, I used it all the time.

108
00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:46.690
f was the one that made me love them.

109
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.107
All right, so this is the where I went.

110
00:05:48.107 --> 00:05:51.180
Okay, then is faster is
when I discovered f.

111
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.276
So let's go over how it works.

112
00:05:53.276 --> 00:05:57.879
So, I wanna jump to that capital T
in contents, the middle character,

113
00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.020
let's call say the middle, second one.

114
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.512
So I can go f capital t, that's a capital
c, because I'm good at typing f capital t.

115
00:06:06.512 --> 00:06:11.240
What it will do is it'll jump to the first
occurrence of that capital letter.

116
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.769
You can do f capital t again to the jump
to the next one, or you can do semi colon,

117
00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:19.767
which will jump to the next one,
you can use comma to jump backwards.

118
00:06:19.767 --> 00:06:24.421
You can use semi colon to jump forwards,
which means you can find a letter and

119
00:06:24.421 --> 00:06:25.720
jump across it.

120
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.254
It's actually pretty darn nice to
be able to just go quickly through

121
00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:30.251
a horizontal row.

122
00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:35.272
't' does the exact same thing,
except for it's up to the character,

123
00:06:35.272 --> 00:06:40.220
not on the character,
meaning if I go tT, I'll jump to the n.

124
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.983
see I jumped almost there.

125
00:06:41.983 --> 00:06:46.482
It has the exact same motions
with the semi colon in that so

126
00:06:46.482 --> 00:06:49.920
you can jump up to, but not past it.

127
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.224
Pretty neat, I thought it's pretty neat
at least up capital f and capital t.

128
00:06:55.224 --> 00:06:59.687
All right, you could probably guess
how it would be capital f capital t,

129
00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:02.774
we'll just simply do f,
but in reverse, right?

130
00:07:02.774 --> 00:07:05.176
I had to figure out which way I
was gonna go, It goes this way,

131
00:07:05.176 --> 00:07:06.850
this time as opposed to this way.

132
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.420
And these two are now backwards, right?

133
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.235
So, semi colon goes backwards in the list,

134
00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:18.160
comma goes forwards because you use f
to go forwards or f to go backwards.

135
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.058
Exact Same thing with capital t, right?

136
00:07:20.058 --> 00:07:27.080
So shift t capital t will jump up to the
capital t but one character ahead of it.

137
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.013
Exact same things work right here,
you got the idea?

138
00:07:30.013 --> 00:07:31.626
Awesome.

139
00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:33.686
We did talk about, I think that's, so

140
00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:36.820
that's like your primary
horizontal movements.

141
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.888
I personally use f and t a whole bunch.

142
00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:42.799
If I wanna delete the contents
of an f statement,

143
00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:45.620
one way you can do is just dt close,
right?

144
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.147
So I jumped up until
the closing parentheses and

145
00:07:48.147 --> 00:07:49.863
closed everything in between.

146
00:07:49.863 --> 00:07:54.290
Now, this may or may not be the best
way to do it, but it is a way to do it.

147
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.105
And it's pretty convenient,
It actually is kind of nice to do.

148
00:07:56.105 --> 00:07:59.583
You can do that instead of strings,
you can delete the content of strings.

149
00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:02.620
You can delete the content of
stuff in between two characters.

150
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.114
You can use them with c as well.

151
00:08:04.114 --> 00:08:08.360
So I can do c t, closing parenthese,
which means I did a change.

152
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.765
And now I'm in insert mode and
I can start typing.

153
00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:14.330
All right, so you can see how c/d
have this relation with each other.

154
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.826
I also use it a lot when
it comes to commas, right?

155
00:08:17.826 --> 00:08:23.110
So if I wanted to delete,
say this middle one, I could do df space.

156
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.976
There you go, I deleted up into and
including that whitespace.

157
00:08:26.976 --> 00:08:30.158
Or I can do dt space, I can do dt, comma,

158
00:08:30.158 --> 00:08:34.303
delete up into the comma
If it's like a larger word.

159
00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:38.058
say it could be, an anonymous function or
something that has a bunch of symbols,

160
00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:40.530
that I couldn't just simply do a udwu on,
right?

161
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.576
So we're using true, it's pretty simple,
but it can be more complex.

162
00:08:44.576 --> 00:08:47.920
All right, so
I did show you relative jumps, right?

163
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.078
So if I wanted to jump to that,
let's learn about horizontal movement,

164
00:08:52.078 --> 00:08:53.656
I could go 10 up, right?

165
00:08:53.656 --> 00:08:55.910
And now we just did it,
I just jumped there.

166
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.903
I could do 9 down jump there.

167
00:08:57.903 --> 00:08:59.565
All right, so
it's actually pretty easy, right?

168
00:08:59.565 --> 00:09:01.156
9 up, 9 down, right.

169
00:09:01.156 --> 00:09:02.960
You can just jump around
using relative jumps.

170
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.957
And this is pretty nice way to move around
but the thing that sucks is if it's

171
00:09:06.957 --> 00:09:10.273
something offscreen,
how do you get to the thing offscreen?

172
00:09:10.273 --> 00:09:13.870
Well if you know the exact word
you can simply just search for it.

173
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.269
That's nice but you don't always know
the exact words you're looking for,

174
00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:20.038
say like the shape of the coat.

175
00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:22.680
Hey, it's down here,
I don't really remember what's down there.

176
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.315
I just wanna be able to go down quickly,
relative jumping stinks.

177
00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:29.898
And the second thing is I also found
relative jumps to be one of the hardest

178
00:09:29.898 --> 00:09:32.740
things to adopt into my
daily kind of code editing.

179
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.730
And so I got so frustrated one time that I
actually did something rather ridiculous.

180
00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.399
Hold on.

181
00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.545
What MRCS Is?

182
00:09:41.858 --> 00:09:44.720
Where are we, then till day?

183
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.104
Okay, so I have this I'll show that
at the end we'll get there but

184
00:09:49.104 --> 00:09:51.191
just not at this exact moment.

185
00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:52.960
Let's go back to the advanced emotions.

186
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.901
All right, so
now we're gonna talk about these ones.

187
00:09:55.901 --> 00:09:58.080
These ones actually
altered your jumping Less.

188
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.311
And so now we're gonna get into
the vertical movements right?

189
00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:02.420
These are like the strong
vertical movements.

190
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.306
So they're opening and closing squirrely
brace they also have opening closing

191
00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:09.033
parentheses but
I just use squirrely brace sometimes,

192
00:10:09.033 --> 00:10:11.890
It effectively jumps by what
is referred to as paragraph.

193
00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:16.130
Paragraph is any contiguous block of code,
right?

194
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.409
So I can sit there and just jump back and
forth, up and down, up and down.

195
00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:21.590
Unfortunately, it does.

196
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.671
If I look at my jumps,

197
00:10:22.671 --> 00:10:26.227
you'll see that it actually does
fill up this whole space right here.

198
00:10:26.227 --> 00:10:27.293
You see all those blank lines,

199
00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.490
It's because I kept jumping to these blank
lines back and forth, back and forth.

200
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.920
And so it actually saves all those jumps
when I use Ctrl 'o' It won't be as good.

201
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.960
Obviously it's smart
enough that if I do this,

202
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.190
it doesn't save all
those intermediate ones.

203
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:45.440
But as I walked down Ctrl o will walk
back up with the squirrely braces.

204
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.260
They're pretty neat, right?

205
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.084
And you can combine them so I could
d curly brace, right I just deleted

206
00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:55.926
from one whitespace all the contiguous
code to the next whitespace.

207
00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:59.520
Pretty cool, I like it I've used it,
It's a fun time.

208
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.670
Do you see any benefits to this?

209
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.009
I would love it if people could say
something, especially in chat or in

210
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:07.701
the zoom call, like if there's something
that you think is neat about that.

211
00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:10.650
What do you think are both the benefits or
the negative amounts?

212
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.947
If you have nothing to say, don't worry,

213
00:11:11.947 --> 00:11:13.325
I'll just say what I
think are the benefits.

214
00:11:13.325 --> 00:11:17.484
The benefit is this, is that if it's
short code that you're looking at,

215
00:11:17.484 --> 00:11:19.631
it's really easy to jump across, but

216
00:11:19.631 --> 00:11:23.273
the hard part is it totally
depends on someone's coding style.

217
00:11:23.273 --> 00:11:27.020
Some people just put
whitespace all over the place.

218
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.048
Pretty much you're hamstrung
at that point, right?

219
00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:32.290
You like you move so dang slow,
some people will take or

220
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.450
I can actually just go like this.

221
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.401
I can just yank it right.

222
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:41.380
I can go yank down and
some people will put a huge amount right?

223
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.640
Have code altogether.

224
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.280
So if you jump, you'll just be like
disorientingly up 100 lines and

225
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.324
like what the heck did I just
miss what was in between there?

226
00:11:49.324 --> 00:11:51.430
So it's not always
the best way to do things.

227
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.149
I'm kinda on the fence of
how good it really is.

228
00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:58.730
And it also alters your jump list.

229
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:03.842
So It can be good, can be bad, you can
make it so it doesn't alter your jump

230
00:12:03.842 --> 00:12:09.706
list, but I found that it just makes some
people's coats style stinky to navigate.

231
00:12:09.706 --> 00:12:11.070
Some people's coats style
makes it really nice.

232
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.026
So maybe I write code that's
nice to use those to jump with.

233
00:12:14.026 --> 00:12:17.557
But maybe my coworker just writes big
gigantic blocks of continuous code and

234
00:12:17.557 --> 00:12:20.217
I jumped from the top of the file
to the bottom of the file.

235
00:12:20.217 --> 00:12:21.260
Super annoying.
