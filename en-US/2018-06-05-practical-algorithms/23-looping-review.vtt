00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Okay, so we're looping.

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.340
We were looping recursively.

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.400
We're saying that we need to
get closer to our base case.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.040
In this case,
our base case is this condition.

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.330
And so these are the kind of patterns
you should be thinking about when

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.870
you're formulating your
recursive solution.

7
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:18.690
What is our base case?

8
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.620
How do we get closer?

9
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.880
What's the work that we actually
care about between now and then?

10
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.050
All right, so what's the difference
between a recursion and a loop?

11
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.673
Not really that much.

12
00:00:31.673 --> 00:00:37.414
Recursion can always be implemented
as a loop, which is fine.

13
00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:42.413
It's not necessarily faster,
but there are some situations

14
00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:47.615
when recursion is gonna be a lot
easier to implement than a loop.

15
00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:54.670
Because for some complex data structures,
especially nested data structures,

16
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.789
you don't know ahead of time
how deeply nested things are.

17
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.965
And to keep track of that, you would
have to use an auxiliary data structure

18
00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:11.370
that kind of sort of maps to a stack,
but you actually use a queue.

19
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.150
So that's how you would do that.

20
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.133
You can do it but

21
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:18.760
it's just way more complicated when
you can just do it using recursion.

22
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.399
And so
that's going to be the typical answer to

23
00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.881
these recursive data structures like
traversing a tree and things like that.

24
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:30.403
The standard answer is gonna
be recursion versus, okay,

25
00:01:30.403 --> 00:01:35.680
let's make a loop and then the queue and
all of this other nonsense.
