00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.310
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: My name is Bianca.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.230
What should you know about me?

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.080
I'm a JavaScript developer.

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.890
I work as a consultant, so I go into
most of the enterprise companies and

5
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.980
help them with their JavaScript.

6
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.833
They also work on open source.

7
00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:16.740
Part of our company, we have an open
source framework called KJS.

8
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.050
So I do work on that as well.

9
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.410
Today, we're going to
talk about algorithms.

10
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.530
Like Mark said, this is part of a four
class series on data structures and

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.040
algorithms.

12
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.320
So this is the sort of
foundational knowledge and

13
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.030
as we move along the series we're
going to build on these topics.

14
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.420
So we're gonna talk about the algorithms,
only today,

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.970
no data structures today,
aside from maybe an object or an array.

16
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.253
And then next time,

17
00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:53.165
we're gonna go over some common interview
data structures and algorithms.

18
00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.064
And then we're gonna apply this stuff, so

19
00:00:55.064 --> 00:00:57.590
this would be a pre-req
to the following course.

20
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.400
And we'll apply these algorithms
to some common data structures,

21
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.830
to some common interview questions and
then the next part.

22
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.850
Part three and
four is all trees and graph theory.

23
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.680
So as web developers,
that's so, so important.

24
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.130
So we're just two days doing all of that.

25
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.570
Traversing, sorting,
balancing, all of that.

26
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.216
So that's sort of the higher
level progression of this course.

27
00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:27.510
So,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Today is algorithms.

28
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.580
So, what is an algorithm?

29
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.530
Why should you care?

30
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.690
So algorithm is just the steps
that you take to solve a problem.

31
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.460
Why should you care?

32
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.035
You're an engineer.

33
00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:38.101
It's your job to solve problems.

34
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:42.637
When we learn about algorithms,
we're learning different techniques to

35
00:01:42.637 --> 00:01:46.604
solve problems in a certain way,
we're identifying patterns.

36
00:01:46.604 --> 00:01:53.662
And we're applying algorithms to
those patterns, to get a result,

37
00:01:53.662 --> 00:01:57.567
to improve the speed of our programs.

38
00:02:00.383 --> 00:02:02.937
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

39
00:02:02.937 --> 00:02:04.250
what are we gonna cover today?

40
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.090
We're gonna cover a lot.

41
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.330
So we're going to discuss

42
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.820
really informally how to
generally estimate an algorithm.

43
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.140
We're not gonna go into mathematical
proofs or anything like that.

44
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.080
But we're going to talk about
little things that you can

45
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.000
spot to start to reason about
the time complexity of an algorithm.

46
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.970
Then we're gonna talk about a couple
techniques for optimization,

47
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.980
which are fun.

48
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.310
We're gonna get really
comfortable with recursion.

49
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.105
How are people feeling about recursion,
right now?

50
00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:35.890
Feeling good?

51
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.380
Okay, cool.

52
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.940
Well, you're gonna be like man,

53
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.760
I think most of this course
is like recursive algorithms.

54
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.100
And going through recursion
in a bunch of different ways.

55
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.230
So if you're feeling like this,
you'll probably be like this at the end.

56
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.526
If you're feeling like this,
you'll probably be here.

57
00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:56.490
So that's fun and something, you know,

58
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.690
it's like such an abstract thing,
it's hard for a lot of people.

59
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.770
So I like to focus on that.

60
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.050
Cuz that's the foundation of a lot
of algorithms, and then we have,

61
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.320
of course, the data structures as well.

62
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.810
So we're gonna do a couple sorting, a
couple searching, I'm not gonna go through

63
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.220
the exhaustive list of every sorting and
searching algorithm, because, you know.

64
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.880
Snooze, but we'll go through a couple and
focus on the implementation

65
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.780
of them rather than the theoretical
aspects of sorting and searching.

66
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.650
If I have time in a future course,
I might go into that, but we'll see.

67
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.630
I don't think it's the most
important thing to understand like

68
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.210
what are the trade-offs between bubble
sort and insertion sort because at

69
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.000
the end of the day, when you get into
your interview, you seem to know one.

70
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.990
You know what I mean so, sure.

71
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.760
We're gonna talk about also the Divide and
Conquer technique and Dynamic Programming.

72
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.690
You might see these and
think okay, recursion.

73
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.910
You're right, recursion, more recursion.

74
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.328
Same with sorting and
searching, recursion.

75
00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:07.641
And then we're gonna talk about the Greedy
technique and my opinions about the Greedy

76
00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:13.040
technique, and how you should apply
the Greedy technique to interviews.

77
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.610
And then we'll also talk
about brute force as well.

78
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.350
Recursive brute force.

79
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.680
Any questions about all of this?

80
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.510
Cool, so it is a lot.

81
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.870
There are corresponding exercises for
each of these topics.

82
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.960
Probably not gonna be able to
finish them in class today

83
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.400
just because I wanna get through a lot.

84
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.740
But you should have a solid attempt for
most of them.

85
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.450
And then we can be in touch after
class if you need help with anything,

86
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.460
and online folks, too.

87
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.764
You can always tweet at me or email me.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Your exercise

88
00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:50.199
solutions, if you want feedback or

89
00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.670
you're stuck or whatever,
happy to do that.
