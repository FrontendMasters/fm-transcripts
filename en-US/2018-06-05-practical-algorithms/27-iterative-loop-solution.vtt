00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.605
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
we're gonna continue with the solution and

2
00:00:03.605 --> 00:00:07.390
we're gonna go through
the iterative approach.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.970
I was mentioning before that being able
to translate between recursion and

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.180
iteration is gonna be key,
is a key concept for dynamic programming.

5
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.400
There's a couple different techniques for
dynamic programming and one core pivot

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.180
is being able to reason about your
recursion in an iterative way.

7
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.590
So, while this may seem kind of repetitive
and maybe a little bit easy at this point,

8
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.500
this is the foundation of a bigger picture
topic that we'll get to in a little bit.

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.520
So here's the iterative approach,
we initialize our results here.

10
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.894
And we can concenate it
with our joined string.

11
00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:57.533
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then at the very
end, we'll return the results and

12
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.620
also the last one.

13
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.753
So if you're not careful, if you do this.

14
00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:10.300
Well, so when you run it,
you get the secret code but

15
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.560
just be careful that if
you don't do this you can.

16
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.190
It will put an e at the end
which is not what you want.

17
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.440
It kind of messes up our code.

18
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.380
Our secret code.

19
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.780
So, just keep that in mind.

20
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.650
There we go, so that's the solution.

21
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.630
How many people got this solution?

22
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.010
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I did one more step.

23
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.000
I put an if statement in there.

24
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.767
I don't know why I did that for

25
00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:45.854
the minus 1 [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

26
00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:47.417
[LAUGH] no worries.

27
00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:51.250
You guys were able to take
a stab at the translation?

28
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Close.

29
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Close.

30
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.870
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I forgot that

31
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.458
there were smiley faces on it so I printed
out secret code and I was like, I got it.

32
00:01:58.458 --> 00:01:59.133
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And

33
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.550
moved on to the other one.

34
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.220
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
No worries,

35
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.170
you weren't looping enough, yeah, cool.

36
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.850
Yeah, I think the smiley faces are
probably the most important part of that

37
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.188
loop or that array so.

38
00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:11.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Glad went

39
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.800
over the solution cuz it
would have been terrible.
