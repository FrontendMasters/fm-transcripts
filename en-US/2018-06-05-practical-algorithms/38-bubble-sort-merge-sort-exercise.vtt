&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So our first learning
exercise is implementing Bubble Sort.

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.185
Remember, this is the Sort
that loops through array,

3
00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:15.177
and it bubbles up
the highest value each time.

4
00:00:15.177 --> 00:00:19.417
And our first task is to
implement Bubble Sort.

5
00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:21.465
So I'm gonna let you do that.

6
00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:25.228
The second task that we have for
sorting, is to implement MergeSort.

7
00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:27.607
We went through
the pseudo-code quite a bit.

8
00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:31.009
So just a reminder that we're gonna
split the array in halves, and

9
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.028
we're gonna merge them recursively.

10
00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:38.929
And once we hit our base case, which
is a sorted list of length one, right?

11
00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.875
So we're gonna check for that base case
with length is, either less than two, or

12
00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:45.563
equals equals equals one.

13
00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:47.389
However you wanna do it is fine.

14
00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:49.776
And then, that's the base case, and

15
00:00:49.776 --> 00:00:53.368
you're gonna start returning
out from your recursion.

16
00:00:53.368 --> 00:00:57.594
And you're going to compare
the arrays item by item.

17
00:00:57.594 --> 00:00:59.346
And you're gonna return that result.

18
00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:03.528
So this is the conquer part of
the divide and conquer paradigm.
