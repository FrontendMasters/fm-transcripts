00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.100
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Are you ready for
an exercise?

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.734
So this exercise is,
take this joint elements,

3
00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:12.778
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Function, and

4
00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:14.300
write it iteratively.

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.994
So I went through the recursive case,
translate that into the iterative case.
