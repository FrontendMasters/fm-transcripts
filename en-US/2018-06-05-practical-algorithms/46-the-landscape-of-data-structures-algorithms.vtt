00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're
gonna do a quick wrap up here.

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.760
We're gonna kinda go through the landscape
of data structures and algorithms.

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.520
This is a mind map that I created
as I was creating this course.

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.530
And it's still in progress, but

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.320
I kinda wanted to give you sort of the big
picture of what we've gone over today.

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.640
So we start off the day with
memorization and recursion,

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.870
which most of these things
that are red are recursion but

8
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.850
even some of them aren't
red are recursion.

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.950
Over here haven't colored them yet.

10
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.017
So we started with memorization and
recursion,

11
00:00:39.017 --> 00:00:43.430
memorization is directly related
to our dynamic programming.

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.050
Which we went over the top
down memorization technique.

13
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.530
And we also talked about greedy algorithms
and commonitorial optimization,

14
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.780
which is a fancy word for what we were
doing with the make change problem.

15
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.330
Where you have a bunch of
different combinations.

16
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.699
You need to find some optimal solution.

17
00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.510
And what else did we do?

18
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.220
We talked about searching.

19
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.300
We did binary search, and linear search.

20
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.040
We went into some sorting algorithms.

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.250
We talked about merge sort
as well as bubble sort.

22
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.530
And we talked about them in
the context of the divide and

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.090
conquer paradigm, or technique.

24
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.530
Some things to look forwards to in future
classes are some data structure concepts

25
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.390
that will be tying into all of these.

26
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.980
You can see there's some arrows, and as I
build this out, there's gonna be more and

27
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.360
more arrows.

28
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.590
And so when we are working with heaps,

29
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.760
we're gonna do binary heaps and
it's gonna take us to some sorting.

30
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.860
When we're doing trees and link lists,
it's gonna take us to some searching.

31
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.868
Graphs and paths all related
to these dynamic programming,

32
00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:51.617
and greedy algorithm concepts,

33
00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:57.120
as well as
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All of these things.

34
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.010
So these are just some concepts too that
you covered, some things to look forward

35
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.020
to in our next time together, in parts
two, three, and four of this workshop.

36
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.441
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are there any
specific go-to sites or

37
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:17.360
resources that you recommend for
their future endeavors.?

38
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.530
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.180
So, I think, I like geeksforgeeks.org.

40
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.130
I like their content.

41
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.639
It's all in Java or C++, though.

42
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.005
There's not a lot of JavaScript specific
content on data structures and algorithms,

43
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:35.749
outside of the Frontend Masters.

44
00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:40.002
And I think there's one
blog that has some.

45
00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:43.000
But for the most part you're
not gonna find a lot of it.

46
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.182
You'll see like maybe on GitHub
people practicing stuff but

47
00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:50.830
there is no definitive guide.

48
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.940
There is a couple books, I haven't been
super impressed with any books to be

49
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.544
honest, in JavaScript yet.

50
00:03:00.544 --> 00:03:02.820
What else?

51
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.500
So I like GeekforGeeks,
I didn't take a lot of the open books?

52
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.342
That's my core go-to,

53
00:03:11.342 --> 00:03:16.000
I like Princeton has a good one
on Coursera The MIT one is good.

54
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.230
It's just on YouTube.

55
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.289
A really good starting one to get
foundational knowledge is CS50 at Harvard.

56
00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:24.380
And that's also on YouTube.

57
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.602
They have companion,

58
00:03:25.602 --> 00:03:29.330
these little short videos that
are five minutes that you can watch.

59
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.947
It doesn't really go into too much code
but it does all the visualization part.

60
00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:39.663
So I think a lot of, yeah,
I think that's good if you're interested.

61
00:03:39.663 --> 00:03:45.213
If you're interested in
the provesome stuff,

62
00:03:45.213 --> 00:03:48.550
then the MIT course is good.

63
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.440
But, I don't know, it kinda depends
on where you wanna go with that.

64
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.976
Yeah, good question.

65
00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:05.727
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, hypothetically,
I made a data structures and

66
00:04:05.727 --> 00:04:10.754
algorithms coloring book,
would you be interested in that?

67
00:04:10.754 --> 00:04:11.334
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.

68
00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:12.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

69
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.970
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

70
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Coloring book?

71
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.789
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

72
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.366
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How does that work?

73
00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:24.762
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's kind of,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Like that.

74
00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:29.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You have a question?

75
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.068
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, Aaron online is
asking what the next part of the course

76
00:04:32.068 --> 00:04:32.610
is going into.

77
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.230
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

78
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.490
So, the next part of the course,
part two is focusing on

79
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.620
some simple data structure, or it's kinda
like your base line data structures.

80
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.290
We're gonna have stacks and
cues of course, linked lists.

81
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.606
We're gonna do a hash

82
00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:56.330
table and
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Those are the ones I

83
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.450
could think of off the top of my head.

84
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.030
We're gonna be doing some data structures,
and

85
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.190
we're gonna be combining
these concepts with that.

86
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.120
So this class is gonna be a prereq for

87
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.750
the next course and
also the other ones as well.

88
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.307
Because we're gonna be
applying these algorithms and

89
00:05:17.307 --> 00:05:23.774
these techniques to data structures, so
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yay,

90
00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:25.410
good job guys, you made it through.

91
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.180
That was a lot.

92
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.044
Remember one of my first
slides where it said.

93
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:39.344
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Now you know.

94
00:05:39.344 --> 00:05:40.370
Now you know.

95
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.550
It was a lot.

96
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.910
We covered a lot.

97
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.550
The next step for
you is to just practice, right?

98
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.310
So you've heard the concepts but
you're really not gonna get

99
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.200
mastery until you really have tried
these in a lot of different scenarios.

100
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.050
But at least you have some words
that you can Google as you

101
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.910
approach problems like maybe a divide and
conquer solution will work for this.

102
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.270
You can reason through that.

103
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.800
Or maybe I can memorize it or
cache it even, and optimize the solution.

104
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.270
So you have some words now
to start working with and

105
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.240
a foundation in which you can
go off into the world and

106
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.060
build up your algorithm content
knowledge and problem solving skills.

107
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.210
Again, algorithms is something people
study for their whole lives, right?

108
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.430
And so you can keep going with it,
and this is just the beginning.

109
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.035
So I'm excited for you as you begin
your journey with algorithms.

110
00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:38.216
And hopefully we can continue that journey
together through the whole data structures

111
00:06:38.216 --> 00:06:40.630
and algorithms course
here at Frontend Masters.

112
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.497
Thank you.

113
00:06:41.497 --> 00:06:42.204
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.

114
00:06:42.204 --> 00:06:46.737
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [APPLAUSE]
