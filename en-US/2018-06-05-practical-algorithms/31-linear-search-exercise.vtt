&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, the next bit would
be either to implement linear search.

2
00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:09.119
So, for this exercise,
we are going to implement linear search.

3
00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.090
Linear search takes two arguments.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.180
The first one is a list,
it doesn't necessarily have to be sorting,

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.164
and the item that you're looking for.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

6
00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:30.500
and so the task here is to implement
the body of this function such that

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.388
it looks through the array to find
the value 90, and it returns the array.
