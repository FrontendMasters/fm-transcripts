00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.800
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So divide and
conquer, the idea of divide and

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.340
conquer is it's a recursive algorithm.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.340
We're always going to be
working on sub problems.

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.050
And so the divide part is we
break it down in each call,

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.650
and the conquer part is we're
gonna do work on each subset.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.930
So whether that work means
that we are going to be

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.520
searching for something,
searching for a match or

8
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.760
getting it into a correct order for doing
sorts, which we'll talk about in a bit.

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.860
And then there's the combine step,
which depending on the divide and

10
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.600
conquer algorithm, the combine step
can look a few different ways.

11
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.620
Emerge sort,
the combine step is really clear, whereas,

12
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.830
in something like binary search,
the combine step is kind of skipped.

13
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.980
It's not really a crucial
part of the algorithm.
