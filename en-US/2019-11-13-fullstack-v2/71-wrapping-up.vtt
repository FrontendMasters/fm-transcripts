00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.761
&gt;&gt; Jem: You have learned so much today.

2
00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:05.580
And honestly, I'm proud of you all for
getting your website working.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.400
If nothing else, you have your
website running, it's running on HV2,

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.820
running on the latest things.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.570
You hopefully it now have
a web socket connection so

6
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.640
you can do some really powerful
things with web sockets.

7
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.575
But you've completed the journey,
you've completed full stack.

8
00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:25.425
I can say at this point,
are you a full stack engineer?

9
00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.876
Close enough for me.

10
00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:28.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem: Nice job, everyone.

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420
And I think that'll wrap it up.

12
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.120
Unless anybody has any final questions,
thoughts,

13
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.840
pearls of wisdom you'd
like to share with me.

14
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.050
Things you said, Jem is wrong.

15
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.090
And I just didn't want to say it in class.

16
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.018
But now we can say it.

17
00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:46.931
&gt;&gt; Jem: All right cool.

18
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:49.397
All right, thanks for listening.

19
00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:54.797
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [APPLAUSE]
