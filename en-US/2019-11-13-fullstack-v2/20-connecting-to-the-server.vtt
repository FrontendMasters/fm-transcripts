00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.743
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
now I want to SSH into my server.

2
00:00:02.743 --> 00:00:06.595
Now that I'm going to create
a secure connection to my server.

3
00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:11.476
The user that is,
by default is root, the root user.

4
00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:14.200
So I'm going to try that now.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.724
So SSH root at my IP address.

6
00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:22.985
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I'm gonna hit Yes.

7
00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:26.950
It's just saying hey,
I've never met this server before.

8
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.025
Are you sure this is what
you wanna connect to?

9
00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:32.115
Which is really useful because let's
say someone hacked your server and

10
00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:32.728
took it over.

11
00:00:32.728 --> 00:00:34.796
The signature is gonna be
a little bit different.

12
00:00:34.796 --> 00:00:39.486
And it's really useful to know like hey,
I'm trying to SSH into this server but

13
00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:41.172
it's not working anymore.

14
00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:44.297
And if you ever get something
like you're SSHing,

15
00:00:44.297 --> 00:00:48.220
you're connected to a server and
the SHA signature is changed,

16
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.597
you should be a little careful
because something's a little bit awry.

17
00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:55.157
Usually it's nothing but
it's just a heads up.

18
00:00:55.157 --> 00:00:56.866
I'm just gonna say yes.

19
00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:01.914
Denied, man what happened there?

20
00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:06.499
Well, what happened is the default
key pair is ID underscore SSH.

21
00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.067
And SSH is going to try
to look there first.

22
00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:12.522
If that doesn't work,
it's going to be like, I don't know,

23
00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:16.388
your key is not matching into the public
key that we have in the server.

24
00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:19.116
So what we need to do is SSH dash I, and

25
00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:24.234
we're going to pass in the name of
that private key that we passed in.

26
00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:31.275
So, fsfe2 and then we type root@

27
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.390
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I am on my server,

28
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.567
you're on your server.

29
00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:45.727
And if you wanna see what's happening, and

30
00:01:45.727 --> 00:01:51.547
I won't pass the dash I this time around,
I'm just gonna say root @ IP address.

31
00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:54.323
I'm gonna say dash V and
it's gonna give me more details.

32
00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:58.636
This is helpful if you try to figure out
hey, why is this thing not being accepted?

33
00:01:58.636 --> 00:02:02.359
Why did that work this time,
that should not have worked, anyways.

34
00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.960
And this just more detail than
you want to know but it's used to

35
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.462
the dashboard command is useful for
debugging if you're ever confused.

36
00:02:12.462 --> 00:02:17.725
And exit my server, I can just type
exit in a back to my normal computer.

37
00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:19.576
You know that was, that was a pain.

38
00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:21.863
I don't want to type
that every single time.

39
00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:25.079
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna add it to the key chain.

40
00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.292
This a great thing about OSX is
it has this concept of keychain.

41
00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:32.668
Most computers do, I'm not sure if
Windows does, but we're gonna add this

42
00:02:32.668 --> 00:02:35.750
to the keychain so that it's part
of the regular keys that it checks.

43
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.764
So when you SSH into a server,
it's gonna say, this one is it.

44
00:02:38.764 --> 00:02:41.382
This one is this one, no, yes?

45
00:02:41.382 --> 00:02:44.325
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was gonna say, you don't
have to do that once you've successfully

46
00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:46.983
connected, it automatically
adds it to your keychain.

47
00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:48.473
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Really?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's why it didn't ask you

48
00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:49.391
the second time.

49
00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:53.111
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So I will say this because
I tried this on a different computer, not

50
00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:57.837
every keychain is automatically configured
to add the keys to the agent every time.

51
00:02:57.837 --> 00:02:59.049
Some computers are.

52
00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.724
But that's a really good point.

53
00:03:00.724 --> 00:03:05.937
I think the modern version of whatever
version of OSX I'm in does that, but

54
00:03:05.937 --> 00:03:11.668
just in case it doesn't, you can say VI
and we're going to modify the SSH config.

55
00:03:11.668 --> 00:03:19.604
So I'm going to say clear vi
tilde dot SSH slash config.

56
00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.993
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
the AddKeysTo the agent just means,

57
00:03:24.993 --> 00:03:27.784
every time you successfully
connect to server.

58
00:03:27.784 --> 00:03:30.433
It's automatically gonna
check that next time.

59
00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:32.881
But they're not always true.

60
00:03:34.774 --> 00:03:36.464
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
then we just say use keychain,

61
00:03:36.464 --> 00:03:38.634
just saying the SSH key
is going to use that.

62
00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:40.073
It's gonna look in the keychain first,

63
00:03:40.073 --> 00:03:41.863
rather than you have to
pass it through manually.

64
00:03:41.863 --> 00:03:44.952
Don't worry about the other stuff,
that's because this is my work computer.

65
00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:51.383
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right.

66
00:04:00.235 --> 00:04:03.188
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And then if you need to,
you can use ssh-add -k and

67
00:04:03.188 --> 00:04:06.417
that will manually add that
to the teaching if you want,

68
00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:09.730
if you don't want to enable
the doing it automatically.

69
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.116
But I would assume most people's computer
is set up is for people at home who

70
00:04:13.116 --> 00:04:17.060
are using a different configuration, maybe
a different operating system entirely.

71
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.253
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Just get
the SSH into our server.

72
00:04:22.253 --> 00:04:23.486
I'm gonna hold here for now.

73
00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:32.535
But
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And we're on.

74
00:04:32.535 --> 00:04:34.589
We are on a server now.

75
00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:38.917
We're on a server somewhere in the world
depending on where your data center is.

76
00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:42.967
Important things to note,
this hash, octothorpe,

77
00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:48.017
whatever you want to call it,
that means we're on as a superuser.

78
00:04:48.017 --> 00:04:49.949
We're on as the group.

79
00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.446
Now, being root is dangerous, and one of
the first things we're gonna do is we're

80
00:04:54.446 --> 00:04:58.707
gonna switch out of root, because root,
it will let you do anything you want.

81
00:04:58.707 --> 00:05:01.204
You wanna remove your entire directory,
you wanna move everything,

82
00:05:01.204 --> 00:05:01.974
it'll let you do it.

83
00:05:01.974 --> 00:05:03.305
It won't give you any warnings.

84
00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:07.550
When we switch out of being a super user,
it means if we do something that is

85
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.943
restricted in permissions, we have to
manually override that every time.

86
00:05:11.943 --> 00:05:13.076
We don't want to go around that.

87
00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:16.129
It's really really tempting to
be to do everything as root.

88
00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.629
But because there are no guardrails as
root, it's assuming you know what you're

89
00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:21.874
doing, you can get yourself
into a really bad spot.

90
00:05:21.874 --> 00:05:26.063
But a little bit later we're going to
learn how to create a new user that

91
00:05:26.063 --> 00:05:29.119
has root permissions, but
by default is not root.
