&gt;&gt; Jem Young: The other one is, another
thing with Nginx is adding a subdomain.

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.890
Yesterday we created a server block for
our servers, and

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.520
that's what's known as a virtual host.

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.420
So I could create ten
different domains and

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.730
ten different servers on
one Nginx configuration.

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.035
And depending on the url
that I'm trying to hit,

7
00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:22.970
Nginx will redirect me to the right place.

8
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.879
So in this case I created a subdomain
called test.jemisthe.best.

9
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:34.516
And a side note, I regret doing jem is
the best because it just doesn't roll off

10
00:00:34.516 --> 00:00:36.310
the tongue like jem.party.

11
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.640
Maybe in V3 I'll do jem.party.

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.690
Or Jem knows how to party, I don't know.

13
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.610
But what's great about Nginx is we
can have as many domains as we want.

14
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.160
And we can have as many
servers as we want,

15
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.260
because in terms of your mental model,
this is a server on its own.

16
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.830
In terms of programming,
this is a server on its own.

17
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.410
In terms of paying for money,
you only have one server.

18
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.120
So that's great.
You have infinite servers here available.

19
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.070
Later in the course, we're going to
create a subdomain just like this.

20
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.670
And we're going to pipe it to our server.

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.695
And then we're going to create
an application that just lives on that

22
00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:14.270
subdomain rather than our main domain.

23
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.320
But for now, this is how you had
a subdomain in, not too hard.

24
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.380
Any questions on this?

25
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.820
Because this is kind of important.

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.530
But we can reference back later.

27
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.620
And if you're wondering
what these double colon and

28
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.020
brackets, it's not really a smiley face.

29
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.510
I don't know, It's, I'm trying to think
if there's an emoji that matches this,

30
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.870
two people with a hat and a beard.

31
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.630
I don't know.

32
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.140
That's just IPv6 notation.

33
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.570
Remember yesterday we learned that
because we ran out of IP addresses,

34
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.750
we had to create IPv6, which would give us
304 undecillion, which is a lot of zeros.

35
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.590
And the fact that I remembered that, but

36
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.100
I can't remember how to properly do
a find just shows you I'm not perfect.
