00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.971
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's talk
a bit more about Nginx.

2
00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:06.007
About Nginx as being a web server,
a reverse proxy,

3
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:10.360
kinda a jack of all trades, and
it's just really, really, really fast.

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.110
So I wanna show you some
common things to do in Nginx.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.940
We're not gonna do too much tweaking
in this particular section on Nginx.

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.748
But these are things
that are useful to know.

7
00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:24.676
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: The redirect, is really
powerful in fact, if you got here today,

8
00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:28.220
you probably used some sort of redirects.

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.730
If I wanna create a shortcut on my site,
I could say jemyoung.com/something and

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.070
I can redirect anywhere else.

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.110
So if you wanted to say I don't know,
put a /help path in your application.

12
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.318
Actually, it wouldn't
even be your application,

13
00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:46.031
this would be before your application.

14
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:52.260
So your application was at, we proxy
pass that to express with that slash.

15
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.360
But instead of doing it in express we can
do it in Nginx, we can redo all redirects,

16
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.750
things like that.

17
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.610
Then this is a trivia, but I'm assuming
some of you are gonna know it.

18
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.261
What is the difference between
a 301 redirect and a 302 redirect?

19
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:10.240
Mark, you have your hand up,
I'm just gonna-

20
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.220
&gt;&gt; Mark: Permanent redirect

21
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.420
versus temporary redirect.

22
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.135
&gt;&gt; Student: Okay, then that's [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes,

23
00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:14.423
is that what you were gonna say?

24
00:01:14.423 --> 00:01:17.300
&gt;&gt; Student: That's wrong.

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.310
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It depends,
one can be better than the other.

26
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.797
Let's say your site is temporarily down
and you redirect your status page,

27
00:01:22.797 --> 00:01:24.714
you wanna do a temporary redirect there.

28
00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:27.790
Because the search engines will crawl,
and they'll say, this is temporary.

29
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.860
We'll check back in a day or two, or
an hour, it doesn't really matter.

30
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.050
But if you do a permanent redirect,
they're gonna mark that as, okay, so

31
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.320
instead of going to your site and
then the status page,

32
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.530
we're just gonna get them
straight to the status page.

33
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.120
So redirects, be a little careful.

34
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.400
But as web developers, we should know
probably different a temporary redirect

35
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.760
in a in a permanent redirects.
