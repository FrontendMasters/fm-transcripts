00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Security is honestly one
of the most important things you'll do,

2
00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:08.001
which kind of run contrary
to what we do as engineers.

3
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.277
We think, no, my job is to build
things and connect things and

4
00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:14.880
make sure the pipes are running
smoothly and everything like that.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.910
But the thing about security is none of,
none of your cleverness, none of

6
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.017
your code, none of your fast application
matters if you have no security.

7
00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:27.378
Because you know what's gonna happen,
some 13 year-old is gonna come in and

8
00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:31.233
wipe your server or he said to you
mine Bitcoin or something like that.

9
00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:32.189
Why, because they can.

10
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.353
And as we noted when
we looked at our blog.

11
00:00:35.353 --> 00:00:36.809
People are trying all the time.

12
00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.606
They're trying right now on your
server and you're thinking,

13
00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.221
I don't have anything worthwhile.

14
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:42.394
I'm gonna keep my BitCoins on my server.

15
00:00:42.394 --> 00:00:43.566
Hopefully you don't.

16
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:47.881
But people wanna get in anyways just
because they use it to build lots of

17
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:52.638
nefarious things or just try to steal
passwords, credit card information,

18
00:00:52.638 --> 00:00:53.825
things like that.

19
00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.174
You never know what's
gonna be on a server.

20
00:00:56.174 --> 00:00:58.704
So people just wanna know and
they're gonna keep trying to get in.

21
00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:00.919
So security is one of the more
important things we're doing.

22
00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:02.455
That's why there's
an entire section on this.

23
00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:04.287
Even though it's full stack engineers,

24
00:01:04.287 --> 00:01:06.651
you probably won't do as
much security as you think.

25
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:10.529
There's dedicated people that dedicate
their entire lives just doing security and

26
00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:12.610
operations, security, things like that.

27
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.532
But these are good practices
to keep in top of mind.

28
00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:18.978
So the question on security is,
jump there,

29
00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:26.588
what could someone do if they gained
just to access to your server, anybody?

30
00:01:26.588 --> 00:01:28.549
What could someone do if they
gained access to your server?

31
00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.183
Yes, Gale?

32
00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:32.384
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you do the horrible
thing of reusing your password,

33
00:01:32.384 --> 00:01:34.898
they have your password for other things.

34
00:01:34.898 --> 00:01:38.712
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, that's a good one and
that's more common you think.

35
00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:42.705
I've seen security professionals that
they have their password taped to their

36
00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:45.148
monitor, because old
habits are hard to break,

37
00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:47.967
which is why we don't even
use passwords in this class.

38
00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:50.543
We use SSH keys because you
while you can reuse those,

39
00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:54.566
you can't steal unless you physically
take someone's computer or their device.

40
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:56.850
What else can someone do if they
have access to your server?

41
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.396
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Redirect your site to them.

42
00:01:58.396 --> 00:02:00.501
Nefarious sites.

43
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.210
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, they can absolutely.

44
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.438
They can say, I want to bankofusa.com.

45
00:02:07.438 --> 00:02:10.554
But it's actually not actually
bankofusa.com to site that looks exactly

46
00:02:10.554 --> 00:02:12.983
like it because they can just
copy your HTML and CSS and JS.

47
00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:15.013
And then everytime you
type in your credentials,

48
00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:16.375
they're just cyphing that off.

49
00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.766
Even better if you weren't using HTTPS,

50
00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:22.396
they can actually forward
everything to the actual real site.

51
00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:25.696
So that the the people running the site
don't know that it's broken and

52
00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:28.125
they're just stealing all
the traffic in between.

53
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.366
That is actually it's called
a man in the middle attack.

54
00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:35.554
And that's very, very common, before HTTPS
and, honestly, it's still far to common.

55
00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:36.917
There's easier ways to prevent that.

56
00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:38.257
What else could someone do?

57
00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:39.801
Anything, what else?

58
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:40.703
Yes.

59
00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:43.828
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They can kind of run
their own server on your server and

60
00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:45.157
until you get banned.

61
00:02:45.157 --> 00:02:50.020
And then all of a sudden, your legit stuff
is not working cuz your IPs are banned

62
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.350
from services like a mailbot or
something like that.

63
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.372
Like when people's bridges
were spamming the world.

64
00:02:55.372 --> 00:02:59.253
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
they can lock you out of your own server.

65
00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:02.721
So that like all that data and
all that time and code you put in,

66
00:03:02.721 --> 00:03:06.347
they can steal it and lock you out
of it and you can't get it back.

67
00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:09.001
And you'll say,
DigitalOcean I can't get in my own server.

68
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:10.162
They'll be like we can't
get in your server.

69
00:03:10.162 --> 00:03:11.755
That's on you, pal.

70
00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:13.486
What else could people do?

71
00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:15.296
I wanna hear more,
Mark do you have something?

72
00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:16.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Scrape your database.

73
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.776
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: They can scrape your
database, they can take all that credit

74
00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:22.839
card information or
unencrypted passwords which today,

75
00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:25.792
people still leave unencrypted
password in database.

76
00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:26.895
Don't do that.

77
00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:30.084
Hopefully, you will never be in that
position where you have to be saving

78
00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:31.192
passwords to database.

79
00:03:31.192 --> 00:03:34.442
They'll be someone who
is more qualified but

80
00:03:34.442 --> 00:03:38.985
most of the hacks of the internet
were by people who got hacked.

81
00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:44.205
Because someone like me who knows
enough to be dangerous thought,

82
00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:45.949
Iâ€™ll use an MD5 hash.

83
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.853
But I'll just do it five times and

84
00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:52.355
I'll hash a password using MD5 which
is a very breakable hashing mechanism.

85
00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:54.349
And I'll save that and it looks secure.

86
00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.583
But because the database
wasn't locked down and

87
00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:58.390
the permission weren't locked down.

88
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.368
They got into the database and
you are like, it's okay

89
00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:05.795
because everything is still safe cuz it's
encrypted and then they decrypted that.

90
00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:10.784
Honestly and that happens way more
often than you'd like to think.

91
00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:14.502
And because there's
a password reach every other

92
00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:18.317
day now it seems like it's
all due to bad security.

93
00:04:18.317 --> 00:04:22.379
And that's why security is really,
really important because at the core,

94
00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.298
if you're running a hospital or
bank or I don't know,

95
00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:28.550
investment company you have
people's lives in your hands.

96
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.541
Your life can be ruined if someone steals
your password, steals all your money or

97
00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:36.666
something like that you can't pay rent,
the power gets shut off things like that.

98
00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:38.413
So security is really, really important.

99
00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:43.098
What's probably even more
common thing that happens when

100
00:04:43.098 --> 00:04:45.784
people servers get broken into.

101
00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:47.300
This one's a little trickier.

102
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.477
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Overloaded with requests.

103
00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:53.071
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, so
that's the end result,

104
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:57.729
what they do is they could turn
into what's known as a botnet.

105
00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.197
And that's just a program
that they install a backdoor.

106
00:05:01.197 --> 00:05:02.346
They won't do anything.

107
00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:06.648
And in fact, if you're really good in
Unix, you can delete all the logs.

108
00:05:06.648 --> 00:05:08.774
So someone could break in,
do a bunch of stuff,

109
00:05:08.774 --> 00:05:12.140
delete the logs that show that they
ever were there which is pretty common.

110
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.196
There's a script that will do it for you.

111
00:05:14.196 --> 00:05:19.024
And then they just turn into like a silent
botnet and they might not do anything for

112
00:05:19.024 --> 00:05:20.376
months or even years.

113
00:05:20.376 --> 00:05:24.072
But when it comes time they can
activate your server, shut down all

114
00:05:24.072 --> 00:05:27.908
the running programs and then turn
that into a way of DDoSing people.

115
00:05:27.908 --> 00:05:31.330
That's distributed denial of attack, which
means I can take all of my servers and

116
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.024
point at, say,

117
00:05:32.024 --> 00:05:35.214
netflix.com and try to take down
assigned level of overwhelming traffic.

118
00:05:35.214 --> 00:05:38.311
That is overwhelmingly what
a lot of hack servers do.

119
00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:40.455
And then once they're done hacking,

120
00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:43.408
sometimes they just wipe
your servers completely.

121
00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:46.849
The more nefarious ones,
we're starting to see a lot more,

122
00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.560
is what is called cryptojacking or
ransoming.

123
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.748
So what they'll do is,
Mark like you're saying earlier,

124
00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:56.846
they'll steal your database credentials,
they'll encrypt all of them.

125
00:05:56.846 --> 00:06:01.138
They'll encrypt your entire database
which is, invaluable information and

126
00:06:01.138 --> 00:06:03.552
then they'll sell it back to you for
money.

127
00:06:03.552 --> 00:06:08.189
Because they encrypted it and
they only they have the password.

128
00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:12.243
That happens a lot, especially with
hospitals and entire towns in America

129
00:06:12.243 --> 00:06:16.039
are getting a ransom because they
still they took over their server and

130
00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.406
encrypted everything.

131
00:06:17.406 --> 00:06:21.067
So at that point, you can say I'm gonna
lose 20, 30, 40 years with the data, or

132
00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:22.637
I'm gonna pay these people ransom.

133
00:06:22.637 --> 00:06:26.703
And there's no guarantee they didn't leave
others things in your system that will

134
00:06:26.703 --> 00:06:29.097
pop up to three years
later that you can't find.

135
00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.932
So all that is to scare you, and

136
00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:35.033
deliberately cuz it's really scary
if someone gets in your server.

137
00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:38.031
Now someone gets root access,
it's game over.

138
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:39.912
You can do anything you want with root,

139
00:06:39.912 --> 00:06:42.315
which is why the first thing
we do is disable root.

140
00:06:42.315 --> 00:06:43.887
But it's not a cure all.
