00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.595
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's talk about
finding things, this is important.

2
00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:04.477
How do you find things
today on your computer?

3
00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.012
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's not a trick question,
I promise you.

4
00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:10.194
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cmd+F.

5
00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:14.359
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, Cmd+F, Finder,
you can do Cmd+Space on Mac,

6
00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.001
which I love,
I wish Windows would pick that up.

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:23.900
But on a Unix system, or on a Linux
system, you can't just Cmd+F, necessarily.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.610
You need something a bit more robust.

9
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.450
So there's two ways generally
we're gonna try to find anything.

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.120
We're gonna use the find command,
and we're gonna use grep.

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.690
And we use grep often because we're
piping output and we're searching for

12
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.580
specific lines in the output.

13
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.547
Find, I haven't used yet, but
we'll run through a few examples.

14
00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:47.497
So find has the syntax of find, the place
you're trying to look, the options you're

15
00:00:47.497 --> 00:00:51.640
trying to look for, such as name or
directory, something like that.

16
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.818
And then the specific file that you're
looking for, so that's the find syntax.

17
00:00:56.818 --> 00:00:58.203
And reference back to this,

18
00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:02.186
because find is one of those things that
you'll forget how to use really quickly,

19
00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:05.396
because it's kind of long and
it's not necessarily intuitive.

20
00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:09.120
You're like,
I just wanna find all my log files, and

21
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.410
you'll be thinking of the syntax.

22
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.346
So feel free to reference back to this.

23
00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:15.516
I'll tell you a secret,
I reference my own slides sometimes

24
00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:18.199
[LAUGH] because I don't
remember all of this stuff.

25
00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:21.159
If you don't use it on the day to day,
that's okay, don't feel bad.

26
00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.539
And don't let anybody make you
feel bad for not remembering this.

27
00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.439
[LAUGH] Unless you're a DevOps person,
these are things you should probably know.

28
00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.729
Some useful options are the type of
the thing you're looking for, the name,

29
00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.109
is the file empty,
is the file executable, is it writable?

30
00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.422
And we'll cover executable and writable
in permissions a little bit later.

31
00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:42.431
But this is pretty useful if you're
trying to lock down your system and

32
00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:46.390
you're saying, hey, I'm in this directory,
did I set all my permissions correctly?

33
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.010
So you can just do a search for
everything that is writable or

34
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.870
not writable, things like that,
in a directory.

35
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.700
So let's run through an exercise.

36
00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.049
It's a bit early, [SOUND] so
let's do some exercises,

37
00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.850
get those fingers working.

38
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.499
So find all the log files in var/log.

39
00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:12.001
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I had to quote *.log.

40
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.921
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Good point.

41
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.254
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Thank you.

42
00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.922
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Again, I'm not perfect,

43
00:02:23.922 --> 00:02:26.961
[LAUGH] I remember these
things as I go along.

44
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:30.469
So did that work for
everybody, hopefully, yes.

45
00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.065
And if we wanted to,
we can grep that output.

46
00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:35.926
We can pipe that output through grep,
and we can say,

47
00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:40.196
I wanna find all of the error logs, or
all of the access logs, things like that.

48
00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.836
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right, now let's find
all the directories with the name log.

49
00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:48.244
You're saying,
why am I always looking for log?

50
00:02:48.244 --> 00:02:52.055
It's something you do most of the time,
because that's one thing you're trying to

51
00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:54.752
search over, you're trying to
find one of your log files.

52
00:02:54.752 --> 00:02:58.341
So find the directory,
the type, and then the name.

53
00:03:01.142 --> 00:03:06.238
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So we're gonna do,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: find,

54
00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:10.838
the directory, the type,

55
00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:16.244
actually, d, the name is log.

56
00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:19.869
And we're getting a lot of permission
denied, because without running sudo,

57
00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.690
you can't dive into those logs,
cuz those are private logs.
