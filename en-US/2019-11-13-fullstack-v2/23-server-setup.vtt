00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.385
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Now we're on part three,
let's set up that server.

2
00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:05.640
So while the name changes
are propagating across the Internet,

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.207
let's set up our servers so
it can actually handle some requests now.

4
00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:14.120
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Essentially, the steps are,
we're gonna update the software.

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.981
We want to create a new
user who's not root.

6
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:17.938
We want to make that user a super user.

7
00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:19.918
We want to enable allow that
user to be able to login so

8
00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:21.912
we don't have to login to the route and
switch over.

9
00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:23.803
And then we want to disable root login.

10
00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:25.823
You always want to disable root login.

11
00:00:25.823 --> 00:00:28.260
There's never a need to login as root.

12
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.024
It will only expose
yourself to more attacks.

13
00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:34.704
If, I could say attacks,
I'll call them attacks.

14
00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:38.160
There are people trying to log in but
they're classified as attacks.

15
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.672
And I list out the steps like this because
the next bit is a lot of commands.

16
00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:47.098
So I'll go really slowly but
it's all terminal from here.

17
00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:49.673
All right, first thing we wanna
do is we want to update software.

18
00:00:49.673 --> 00:00:51.340
We're using ATP.

19
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.430
If you're following tutorial on
the Internet or have before,

20
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.599
you're probably using apt get.

21
00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:02.223
APT is a wrapper around app get and
app I think cash maybe.

22
00:01:02.223 --> 00:01:04.187
But it's a simpler way of doing abt.

23
00:01:04.187 --> 00:01:08.702
It's just think of NPM in terms of
it's a software package of how to

24
00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:10.164
download software.

25
00:01:10.164 --> 00:01:13.909
So we're still a root at this point but
let's go and update the software.

26
00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.976
So run apt update and then once a software
is updated, it might take a minute.

27
00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:21.607
Run apt upgrade.

28
00:01:21.607 --> 00:01:25.163
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So,
I exited out of root a while ago.

29
00:01:25.163 --> 00:01:26.301
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Just, yeah.

30
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:29.979
So log back into your server,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

31
00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.414
the way to get out of a server is exit.

32
00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:34.470
And if you switch user,
you can exit and then exit again, so

33
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.668
it's gonna drop you back to root and
then you're gonna exit.

34
00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:39.454
So I'm gonna run those as well.

35
00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:44.586
First thing I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna log back in.

36
00:01:44.586 --> 00:01:48.920
I should also note that if you didn't know
in the terminal, you can just go up or

37
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.035
down to go back through your history.

38
00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:54.315
I will use that a lot if
you're wondering how I type so

39
00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:57.894
fast is because I'm just
traversing back up my history,

40
00:01:57.894 --> 00:02:02.166
and I'm just gonna login as roots,
and I'm gonna run apt updates.

41
00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:11.341
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
updating all my software.

42
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:13.638
And I'm gonna run apt upgrade,

43
00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:17.646
just to make sure I'm on
the latest versions of things.

44
00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:20.400
And I'm gonna say, yes.

45
00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:26.263
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: In general, you always
want to keep your software up to date.

46
00:02:26.263 --> 00:02:29.127
In fact, who was it?

47
00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:33.582
So folks, I forget who there is just
happened yesterday I was reading the news.

48
00:02:33.582 --> 00:02:35.659
There is a security provider that they,

49
00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.277
it was like the equivalent of
Symantec Norton or something like that.

50
00:02:39.277 --> 00:02:42.519
They're one of the big names in
security and they got hacked.

51
00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.991
Because their forum software was like
two years out of date or I'm sorry,

52
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:48.344
it wasn't two years,
it was two days out of date.

53
00:02:48.344 --> 00:02:52.020
There's a vulnerability in the VB Bolton
software they used for the forum.

54
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.257
The forum got hacked because they
didn't keep their software up to date.

55
00:02:55.257 --> 00:02:58.225
Almost all vulnerabilities
you'll find are from,

56
00:02:58.225 --> 00:03:02.678
are not from like state actors or people
determined to get into your software or

57
00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:04.643
determined to get to your server.

58
00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:06.497
It's because you have some software.

59
00:03:06.497 --> 00:03:07.628
That software communicates,

60
00:03:07.628 --> 00:03:09.500
the application communicates
with the Internet.

61
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.934
And those that application
has vulnerabilities in it.

62
00:03:11.934 --> 00:03:15.111
So you always want to keep
your software up to date.

63
00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:19.664
If I give you any security tip
besides using SSH over a password.

64
00:03:19.664 --> 00:03:21.173
It's keeping your software up to date.

65
00:03:21.173 --> 00:03:23.794
You'll be fine most of the time.

66
00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:28.507
I'm gonna use the package
maintainer's version.

67
00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:31.286
Because that way I can when I
upgrade later it will be in sync

68
00:03:31.286 --> 00:03:35.051
with whatever they recommend versus
whatever was installed based on the box.

69
00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:38.745
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And we should be good now.

70
00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:40.633
I started behind everybody and I'm done.

71
00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:43.082
So hopefully everybody else is done.

72
00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:45.048
We're gonna add a user.

73
00:03:45.048 --> 00:03:48.595
Normally this would require using,
well we're already root so

74
00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:51.229
we don't have to do sudo or
anything like that.

75
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.431
All right, so
let's think of a username you want to use.

76
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:57.689
And we're gonna use the add the dash now.

77
00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.297
Add user, I'm just gonna say jem.

78
00:04:00.297 --> 00:04:01.817
You can use jem if you want.

79
00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:06.650
I'm not gonna be offended and
create a new UNIX password.

80
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.249
I'm gonna use something really short
because we're gonna be typing a lot and

81
00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.096
we'll use another short one.

82
00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:19.598
You can leave it empty for
this stuff, cool.

83
00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:22.110
So I did add user with the user name.

84
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.121
I put in a password and then I just
put in the blanks for everything else.

85
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:29.785
You can put in the full name,
root number if you want.

86
00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:31.160
It's your server.

87
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.467
I'm not gonna tell you how to run it.

88
00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:33.981
Actually, I will tell you how to run it.

89
00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:35.635
That's literally what I'm doing now.

90
00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:36.977
But you can put in whatever you want for
this part.

91
00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:38.360
It doesn't matter.
