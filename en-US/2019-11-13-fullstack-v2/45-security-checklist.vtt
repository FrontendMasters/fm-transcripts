00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.910
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: When it comes to security,

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.360
there are a few key ways that we think
about how to lock down our server.

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.521
The first one we talked about before
was SSH, secure socket shell.

4
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:16.271
So instead of using a username and
password, we use SSH.

5
00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:19.971
Because the problem with a username
password is, one, humans,

6
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:23.078
we tend to reuse the same
password over and over again.

7
00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:27.353
Or we'll use variations of password or
password1.

8
00:00:27.353 --> 00:00:32.048
In fact, security researchers, when
they look at stolen passwords, they say,

9
00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:34.787
what are the top five
common stolen passwords?

10
00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:37.348
And they're like 12345.

11
00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:40.278
And you're like, I made my password
requirement eight characters

12
00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:42.016
rather than five cuz that's more secure.

13
00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:44.183
So what do people do?

14
00:00:44.183 --> 00:00:46.087
12345678.

15
00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:50.551
I'm not kidding, if you look at hacked
passwords, it'll be password or

16
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.431
password with,
instead of an a, an @ symbol.

17
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:55.368
Humans, we're our own worst enemy.

18
00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:59.492
So what we do is we create
these security rules and

19
00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:06.046
protocols that help us kind of not shoot
ourselves in our foot, cuz you will.

20
00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:10.305
If I didn't tell you, we'd probably
still be doing everything as root, and

21
00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:11.427
bad things entail.

22
00:01:11.427 --> 00:01:14.712
So it's best to follow the best
practices of the community.

23
00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:17.256
Another way of handling security, and

24
00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:21.192
the one you're probably all familiar with,
is firewalls.

25
00:01:21.192 --> 00:01:25.062
Another one is just keeping
your software just up-to-date.

26
00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:29.482
Because vulnerabilities and
zero days, they happen all the time.

27
00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:32.557
In fact, there is big money in zero days.

28
00:01:32.557 --> 00:01:34.587
And I say zero days,
but what is a zero day?

29
00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:37.550
I'm sure you've heard the term before.

30
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:41.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Unpatched vulnerability.

31
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.800
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's
an unpatched vulnerability,

32
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.500
specifically one that the company itself,
so Microsoft or

33
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.400
Apple or Google,
has not found or documented yet.

34
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.332
So it's an undocumented vulnerability,
and zero days are worth a ton of money.

35
00:01:57.332 --> 00:02:00.610
We're talking millions of dollars,
depending on what the exploit is.

36
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.170
And there's so much so
that there's entire companies

37
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.400
that all they do is try to find zero days
and then sell them to the highest bidders.

38
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.580
These are kind of known as gray hats
in the world, because they're like,

39
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.360
well, we're not actually
doing anything bad with this.

40
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.900
We're just handing it off to someone else.

41
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.780
So gray hat is known as someone
who's morally ambiguous.

42
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.170
The good security researchers, the people
that are trying to protect you and

43
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.511
keep your software up-to-date and
are trying to find vulnerabilities and

44
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:30.432
then tell the companies about them
are known as white hat hackers,

45
00:02:30.432 --> 00:02:31.603
and are security people.

46
00:02:31.603 --> 00:02:35.495
And the bad ones, the nefarious ones,
are known as black hats.

47
00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:39.194
And then there's the lowest here of
hackers and bad security people,

48
00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:41.100
which are known as script kiddies.

49
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.951
Those are people that just download
things from the Internet and

50
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:46.709
then run it against entire IP
ranges trying to break in, yes?

51
00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.382
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: One of the most
famous zero day things was Stuxnet,

52
00:02:51.382 --> 00:02:55.947
where our government or
whoever attacked the Iran

53
00:02:55.947 --> 00:03:01.600
radioactive program or
whatever, nuclear program.

54
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.674
And then they used four zero day things

55
00:03:06.674 --> 00:03:10.954
as a worm to spread this worm into

56
00:03:10.954 --> 00:03:15.564
the facility, it's just crazy.

57
00:03:15.564 --> 00:03:19.424
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Stuxnet is fascinating.

58
00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:23.938
We're talking about security, every
government in the world has their own

59
00:03:23.938 --> 00:03:27.590
security teams and
hacking teams and zero day teams.

60
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.300
They won't talk much about it, but

61
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.090
they all have them because it's
this cyber war that's going on.

62
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.854
But I won't say war,
cuz it's not official, but

63
00:03:34.854 --> 00:03:37.379
pretty much everybody's trying to
break into everybody all the time.

64
00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.565
If you look at your auth log you see that
there's people trying to break in your

65
00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:41.360
server right now.

66
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.460
Stuxnet is a really interesting example.

67
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.770
And it goes back to, what can someone
do if they gain access to your server?

68
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.992
So what Stuxnet did was they
chained a bunch of zero day, so

69
00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:54.588
that is unpatched, unknown bugs.

70
00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:57.751
And they usually start with some sort of
a stack overflow or something like that,

71
00:03:57.751 --> 00:03:59.150
something innocuous.

72
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.685
But if you can make a computer stack
overflow, you can make it throw an error,

73
00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:02.818
and that error, you can control.

74
00:04:02.818 --> 00:04:05.472
And then once you start
chaining those together,

75
00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:07.690
you can actually start doing something.

76
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.404
So even the most minor vulnerability can
turn into something major if someone knows

77
00:04:11.404 --> 00:04:12.421
what they're doing.

78
00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:15.732
And what Stuxnet did was
they planted software into,

79
00:04:15.732 --> 00:04:19.347
I wanna say it was the USB drives,
that's how it started.

80
00:04:19.347 --> 00:04:23.023
Because this was a nuclear facility
that refined uranium, or plutonium,

81
00:04:23.023 --> 00:04:24.024
probably uranium.

82
00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:25.532
And they're like, okay,

83
00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:29.018
we know we're dealing with things
that are really dangerous.

84
00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:31.600
We're not gonna connect
to the Internet at all.

85
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.490
So what Stuxnet did was they
hooked up to someone's USB drive.

86
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.656
So I don't know, a secretary or someone,
so whenever they hacked their computer.

87
00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:45.182
So whenever they plugged in the USB drive,
they dumped the software into that.

88
00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:48.294
So when that person went to work and
they plugged in that USB to,

89
00:04:48.294 --> 00:04:52.644
I don't know, watch movies or something,
whatever people at nuclear facilities do,

90
00:04:52.644 --> 00:04:54.265
that now got on to their server.

91
00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:58.800
So even though that computer wasn't
connected at all to the Internet, they now

92
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.547
managed to infiltrate the entire network,
which honestly is next level hacking.

93
00:05:03.547 --> 00:05:07.991
If you can hack someone's server
without actually being connected to it,

94
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:12.576
that's like only something governments
can achieve, or really, really,

95
00:05:12.576 --> 00:05:14.426
really big funded companies.

96
00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:16.264
But what they did was really subtle.

97
00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:20.927
They just turned off the controls for
the things that refined uranium.

98
00:05:20.927 --> 00:05:22.269
So they just made them
spin out of control.

99
00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:25.808
And they literally destroyed millions and
millions of dollars in machinery and

100
00:05:25.808 --> 00:05:26.770
set them back years.

101
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.270
All because their servers weren't secure
and their security protocols were bad.

102
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.040
So again, I say this to scare you
because you should be scared.

103
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.838
You don't know the unintended
consequences of having bad security.

104
00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:42.144
Another common security factor
is two factor authentication.

105
00:05:42.144 --> 00:05:44.868
That just means instead of just SSHing,
you would SSH and

106
00:05:44.868 --> 00:05:47.775
then they send some sort of push
notification to your phone.

107
00:05:47.775 --> 00:05:51.891
A device you'd have on you or a UB key you
plug into your phone, and then you say,

108
00:05:51.891 --> 00:05:52.826
yes, this is me.

109
00:05:52.826 --> 00:05:57.613
It's just another layer of authentication
that we're all pretty familiar with.

110
00:05:57.613 --> 00:06:00.680
But that doesn't always work too
because there are ways around that.

111
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.540
For instance, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter,
got hacked because Twitter

112
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.300
has this weird workaround where you can
still send tweets via text message.

113
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.090
So all they did was they called
up AT&amp;T and they said, or

114
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.480
whatever his phone company was, they said,
hey, I got a new phone, I'm Jack Dorsey.

115
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.719
And they're like, are you sure?

116
00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:21.104
They're like, yeah.

117
00:06:21.104 --> 00:06:23.189
They're like, okay, sounds good to me.

118
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.592
And so his probably long password,
his two factor authentication was rendered

119
00:06:27.592 --> 00:06:30.362
worthless because there's
just a way around it.

120
00:06:30.362 --> 00:06:34.119
That's why when we think about security
we're talking about creating an entire

121
00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:35.565
wall around everything we do.

122
00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:38.270
And then every step of the way we say,
are you sure?

123
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.917
Are you sure?
And

124
00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:43.531
it seems really onerous whenever we have
the sudo things, but it's because of that.

125
00:06:43.531 --> 00:06:46.062
You always want security
on every step of the way.

126
00:06:46.062 --> 00:06:50.441
Another security feature that
probably most companies use is a VPN,

127
00:06:50.441 --> 00:06:52.262
a virtual private network.

128
00:06:52.262 --> 00:06:55.144
That's essentially a wall
between the Internet and

129
00:06:55.144 --> 00:06:57.665
the Intranet, which we discussed earlier.

130
00:06:57.665 --> 00:06:59.440
Intranet is private Internet.

131
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.727
And it just means everything
through the wall is unencumbered.

132
00:07:02.727 --> 00:07:04.856
You can develop,
you can push, you can pull,

133
00:07:04.856 --> 00:07:08.139
you can login to servers as long as
you pass through the rigor of the VPN.

134
00:07:10.898 --> 00:07:13.258
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I can talk more
about VPNs a little later,

135
00:07:13.258 --> 00:07:15.758
cuz they're not super critical right now.

136
00:07:15.758 --> 00:07:19.202
But in general,
I surf the Internet using a VPN.

137
00:07:19.202 --> 00:07:21.752
Probably most of you should at some point.

138
00:07:21.752 --> 00:07:24.219
It's a little safer and
it prevents snooping.

139
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.688
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I'll talk about that later,
if you want, towards the end.

140
00:07:27.688 --> 00:07:29.149
I don't wanna get hung up on security,

141
00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:31.780
cuz I keep telling stories about
it cuz they're really interesting.
