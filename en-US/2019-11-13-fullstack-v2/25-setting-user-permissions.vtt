00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.838
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right, so let's change
our home directory, which we did so

2
00:00:02.838 --> 00:00:03.674
that's cd tilde.

3
00:00:06.023 --> 00:00:06.946
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And honestly,

4
00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:11.855
I didn't know until I think I was an adult
that the squiggle sign is called a tilde.

5
00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:14.238
And then the other one,
the what he called it?

6
00:00:14.238 --> 00:00:19.430
The same one that's on the tilde is called
a grave marker that I didn't know either.

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.565
Yeah, I know you learn all sorts of
stuff when your run a full stack.

8
00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:27.595
What we wanna do is we wanna
make a .ssh directory,

9
00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:32.304
because our SSH keys are by
default in the .ssh directory.

10
00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:35.634
We wanna be able to
login as this user now,

11
00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:39.930
because we're gonna disable
root login in a second.

12
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.630
So mkdir -p, the -p just creates
a directory if it doesn't already exist.

13
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.595
And then ~/.ssh, so
we're creating a .ssh directory.

14
00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:57.247
I'm gonna do that here, mkdir -p ~/.ssh.

15
00:00:57.247 --> 00:01:01.163
And we do an ls -a, yeah,

16
00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:07.225
it'll list out all of our directories.

17
00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:13.160
Actually, I think I want -l, no I want -a.

18
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.933
Anything with a dot in front of it is
considered a hidden directory by default.

19
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.329
If I do ls nothing shows up,
because I have no directories.

20
00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.857
But when I do an ls -a will see
all the hidden directories or

21
00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:23.735
hidden files that are in here.

22
00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:30.780
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Right there.

23
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.450
So now, we're gonna create a new file,
we're gonna use vim.

24
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.630
We're gonna create a file
called authorized keys, and

25
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.870
when we do that we're gonna paste our
public key into our authorized key file.

26
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.760
Again exactly what we did,
how digital ocean sets up your server.

27
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.570
It does this for
you when you create a root directory, but

28
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.810
now we're just doing this for
our new user.

29
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.692
So we can SSH in, so

30
00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:58.750
vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

31
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.099
I'm going to do that now,
hopefully I can spell authorized right,

32
00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:03.430
I'm a terrible speller.

33
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:12.653
.ssh/authorized_keys.

34
00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:16.842
And from there, I am going to grab my
public key from my other terminal, so

35
00:02:16.842 --> 00:02:23.030
I'm just gonna
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I'm just gonna fire.

36
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.140
I just opened up another terminal,
nothing fancy.

37
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.560
Actually copied that before but I'm
going to CD into my dot safe directory.

38
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.480
And then I'm going to cat that I made,
so fsfe2.

39
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.129
Remember it's the dot pub, and
I'm just going to copy this.

40
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.904
But I'm just gonna insert,
I'm gonna paste that in.

41
00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:51.452
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And then I'm gonna save it.

42
00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.330
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Everybody with me so far?

43
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.125
So you create an authorized key file,

44
00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:03.230
and then you paste it in your
public key that you wanna SSH into.

45
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.842
So vi, we open it to edit, and if a file
doesn't exist when you open it with vi,

46
00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:14.040
it'll create it for you when you write it,
and then just write quit, or yeah.

47
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.878
I don't like saying write quit, because
it sounds like saying right click, but

48
00:03:19.878 --> 00:03:21.518
I'll say WQ, UWQ out of it.

49
00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:24.623
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Right.

50
00:03:28.768 --> 00:03:31.040
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Everybody good so far?

51
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.850
Okay.
All right, so now,

52
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.690
what we're gonna do is we're gonna exit,
and then we're gonna exit.

53
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.600
So exiting one time
puts us back in a root,

54
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.720
cuz all we did when we switched users,
we opened a new shell.

55
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.097
So we're gonna exit out of there,
exit again, then we're gonna ssh in

56
00:03:45.097 --> 00:03:49.817
with our new user name
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So exits,

57
00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:52.144
then exits, and then

58
00:03:58.602 --> 00:04:01.230
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Gonna ssh with user name Jem

59
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.061
at the IP address.

60
00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:08.030
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
if I pasted things right, I'm in my server
