00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.170
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Mm,
you know what we haven't done?

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.060
And this is a bit of a side quest.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.710
But we haven't looked at
our op log in a while.

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.880
Let's see what's going on there,
I just want to see what's happening.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.320
Apologies for the shift, but
it's just interesting to me.

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.951
So let's say cat /var/log and
then, look at the authlog and

7
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:26.150
it's going to deny me, so
I'm going to sudo bang bang.

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.520
What's going on here?

9
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.970
Anything interesting?

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.120
Anything interesting?

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.780
Yeah, it's a lot of people trying
to connect to my computer again.

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.570
Later, yes?

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I noticed you're
using the history shortcut,

14
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.420
you haven't mentioned that.

15
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.410
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: The history shortcut,
did I not yesterday?

16
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.930
Hmm, the history shortcut, so
you can go up, and you're just traversing.

17
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Bang bang.

18
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.253
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, the pseudo bang bang.

19
00:00:58.253 --> 00:01:00.950
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I mentioned that yesterday,
yeah.

20
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.320
Just in case you didn't know.

21
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.470
If you wanna run the last command, so

22
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.220
I'm gonna run this again,
which won't work without sudo.

23
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.880
But if I run sudo bang it's
gonna replay what I want and

24
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.430
it's gonna see the last command but
with sudo.

25
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.360
So we're just replaying the history with
the sudo command and then it works again.

26
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.983
If you didn't catch that,

27
00:01:18.983 --> 00:01:20.130
that is something that will
save you a lot of time.

28
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.980
The other one I did was reversing my
bash history, so I can go up, down.

29
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.870
If you wanna find something in your
bash history, control R, say log and

30
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.280
it will look through all
of your bash history.

31
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.460
These are super useful.

32
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.340
They're nice shortcuts.

33
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.910
And the good thing is they work on your
Mac too, if you do a lot of command line

34
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.870
programming, using control R,
going up through history going back.

35
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.920
Again, it's this common platform that
makes these things powerful because, yes,

36
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.863
while OS X is a BSc and
this we're using Ubuntu,

37
00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:57.316
which is a different Linux distribution or
different distribution.

38
00:01:57.316 --> 00:02:00.170
They still work the same cuz we're still
using bash which is this common program

39
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.050
that works over all of them.
