WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.330
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Next thing I wanna do
now that we're successfully logged in

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.400
our server, we know our server has or
our new user has route access.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.730
We're gonna disable route, cuz remember
all those people trying to get in,

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.070
it's never beneficial for
them to get in as route.

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.151
And route is one of the more
common username, so

6
00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:15.878
they're gonna try to break it as well.

7
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:19.662
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: First
thing we need to do is,

8
00:00:19.662 --> 00:00:23.290
actually don't need this
change the permissions.

9
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.000
But for
now we're gonna change permissions, so

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.660
that it's read and readable by our users.

11
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.885
So you're gonna probably sudo chmod
644 and that authorized key file.

12
00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:40.769
So I'm gonna do that here, in my server.
So, we'll see if I need sudo.

13
00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:48.920
chmod 644 -/ .ssh/authorized_keys.

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.240
Cool, didn't need sudo for that one.

15
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.360
And we actually did need to do this step,

16
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.260
but depending on what your server is
set up as, you may need to do it.

17
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.909
So I just added it in there for
the future,

18
00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.525
just kinda bullet proofing ourselves.

19
00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:01.240
And all we're doing is changing
that the permissions that file so

20
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.750
they're not reading readable by everybody.

21
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.561
They're only readable and
rattled by sudo, myself, and

22
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:10.599
certain file system daemons,
like SSH daemon.

23
00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.577
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Next thing we're gonna do,
now we're gonna disable root login.

24
00:01:15.577 --> 00:01:16.299
So we're gonna modify our SSH config, or

25
00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.074
the SSH daemon config
on our server itself.

26
00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:19.499
So sudo vi

27
00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:27.386
/etc/ssh/sshd_config.

28
00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:31.343
And remember, you can always
tab complete and most of this.

29
00:01:31.343 --> 00:01:34.766
Let'say sudo

30
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:42.752
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config,

31
00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:46.178
my password.

32
00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:49.350
And now we're in the SSH daemon config.
The daemon is a program that's always

33
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.382
running in the background.

34
00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:52.814
And that's what allows us the SSH and
we don't need to do anything to start it.

35
00:01:52.814 --> 00:01:53.661
We don't need to do anything to stop it.
It's just constantly running and

36
00:01:53.661 --> 00:02:01.032
listening.
And we're gonna disable RootLogin.

37
00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:07.044
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So I'm just gonna edit and
switch that to a no.

38
00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:08.530
Is there anything else
I wanna change in here?

39
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.280
PubkeyAuthentication, that's fine.

40
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.040
StrictMode, I'll leave it as is for now.

41
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.544
I don't wanna mess too much with it.

42
00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:23.602
But with SSH daemon, you can do lots
of things like enable password login,

43
00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:25.382
disable password login.

44
00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:29.543
Have max retry, so someone can only
retry a certain amount of time for

45
00:02:29.543 --> 00:02:33.009
just bands them completely for
a certain amount of time.

46
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.930
Maximum number of times you can be
logged in as one user, things like that.

47
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.970
We're gonna leave that alone for now.

48
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.910
A word of caution, anytime you're using
sudo means you can do something really

49
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.060
dangerous for
modifying SSH daemon configuration.

50
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.770
You can modify it in such a way that you
can lock yourself out of your own server,

51
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.400
which would be pretty embarrassing.

52
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.330
But if that happens to start over again,
you'll catch up pretty quickly.

53
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.850
It's not the end of the world.

54
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.680
These all become a real big deal if
you have a production server and

55
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.818
you lock yourself out of production
serve,r known to get in and

56
00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:05.560
yeah [LAUGH]
Yes.

57
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You've changed the port.

58
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.040
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I don't, for
the case of this class,

59
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.300
but a lot of people they find
changing the port is helpful support.

60
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.623
SSH is always on port 22 by default.

61
00:03:16.623 --> 00:03:18.210
You can change the port to something else.

62
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.090
Anything else you want.

63
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.370
Well, that's not already being used.

64
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.962
Which it helps a little bit with people
constantly attacking your server cuz they

65
00:03:25.962 --> 00:03:27.169
know SSH on port 22.

66
00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.460
But we call that security above security.

67
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.790
You think you're more safe because you're
like, my door's actually down here.

68
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.910
And you feel safer.

69
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.752
But that's not a real thing.

70
00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:42.469
There are lessons in the history
of security and computing,

71
00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:48.140
security above security is the one
that will get you in the long run.

72
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.890
Trying to obscure things,
people don't know SSH anything, so

73
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.760
they have to know to
choose a different port.

74
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.447
And also,
you'll probably forget what the port is.

75
00:03:56.447 --> 00:03:59.875
And honestly you should just be
more secure in general, yes?

76
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.958
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How is that different
than changing the user name, though?

77
00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.319
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: From?

78
00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.077
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: From root to whatever you
chose, I mean you're making it more

79
00:04:06.077 --> 00:04:14.153
obscure.
How was it?

80
00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:19.410
Why wouldn't it be good to change
both the user and the port number?

81
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.030
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: You could and

82
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.930
generally when people set up computers
a lot of times thet do that.

83
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.070
Changing the username was not so
much for security,

84
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.530
so much as we don't wanna be rude.

85
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.330
It's just a dangerous place to be and
we're gonna have to switch users.

86
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.030
Yeah, it helps a tiny, tiny bit.

87
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.020
But again,
I would not ever say that's for security.

88
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.450
It's just because it's
a good practice to do.

89
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.000
But good question.

90
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.470
But yeah, security by obscurity is never,
never good example.

91
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.250
You might even say like I'm
gonna set up my server and

92
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.980
not put any security on it cuz it's like,
who's gonna find it?

93
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.575
Someone will find it and they will get it.

94
00:04:52.575 --> 00:04:55.623
[LAUGH] I promise you, they will.

95
00:04:55.623 --> 00:04:57.446
So we're just gonna wq out of here.

96
00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.654
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And the next thing we wanna
do is we change the configuration but

97
00:05:03.654 --> 00:05:06.575
because that daemon's always running,
it's not always checking the config.

98
00:05:06.575 --> 00:05:08.655
So we wanna restart that service.

99
00:05:08.655 --> 00:05:15.767
So to do that we say sudo service
sshd SSH daemon and just add restart.

100
00:05:15.767 --> 00:05:17.790
You have to login twice, it's okay.

101
00:05:20.277 --> 00:05:26.391
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
sudo service sshd restart.

102
00:05:34.512 --> 00:05:39.228
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And now if I did everything
correctly I'm gonna try to log in as

103
00:05:39.228 --> 00:05:41.960
roots and it won't let me anymore.

104
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.241
That means we configured it properly.

105
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:47.820
All right, we're in,
we disable the root login.

106
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.240
I'm feeling better about that.

107
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.390
We have root if we ever need to with sudo.

108
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.770
But again, we don't wanna do things on
root, unless you're just really lazy.

109
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.450
You don't wanna type
sudo all the time but.

110
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.246
Yes.

111
00:06:00.246 --> 00:06:03.996
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
we both have System restart required.

112
00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:05.220
What do you think that is?

113
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.290
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It does that every time
you run a large update or upgrade,

114
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.140
it's gonna say restart your system.

115
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.467
What we can do is turn the box off, while
we're not actually turned the box off,

116
00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:15.714
we're turning our tiny little
fraction of a box off.

117
00:06:15.714 --> 00:06:17.982
And turn it back on and I'll fix that.

118
00:06:17.982 --> 00:06:18.575
But for now,
it's not that important for now.

119
00:06:18.575 --> 00:06:22.879
Later it will be.

120
00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.266
And later we'll talk
about process managers,

121
00:06:25.266 --> 00:06:29.085
which means how to get everything you
need up and running when you're sort of

122
00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:32.921
research versus having to start it
manually and then keep it up and running.

123
00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:34.310
But that'll be a little bit later.

124
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.510
But good question.

125
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.640
But for now, don't sweat that too much.

126
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.070
We have root.

127
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.710
If you really want,
you can keep doing things as root.

128
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.890
I don't recommend it [LAUGH].

129
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.020
You are on your own if you do that.
