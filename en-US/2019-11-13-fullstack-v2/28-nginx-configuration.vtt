00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.710
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right,
Nginx is serving us a page.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.040
But where did that come from?

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.680
What is it doing?

4
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.250
Let's take a look.

5
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.920
So, let's look at the Nginx configuration.

6
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.000
And we're gonna spend a lot of, well,

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.620
we're gonna spend a fair amount of
time in the Nginx configuration.

8
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.868
So, let's get familiar with it.

9
00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:21.348
So, sudo less or vi or cat or
whatever you want to do,

10
00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:25.959
but up for
less etc Nginx sites available and

11
00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:31.082
we're going to use
the default configuration.

12
00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:36.440
And remember you can tab
complete most of this.

13
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.304
So I will say sudo less
etc nginx sites-available,

14
00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:48.056
and default, cool, and

15
00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:52.900
it's a lot, I know it's a lot.

16
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.179
Nginx kindly provides comments in here,
links to start reading.

17
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.690
I'll warn you now the Nginx
documentation is not pretty.

18
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.050
It's good.
It's thorough, obviously,

19
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.130
but it's not the most readable thing
you're ever going to run across.

20
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.890
So generally, if you're talking about
tweaking Nginx, it's better to do Google

21
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.180
search on it and read a blog post
on somebody that's talked about it.

22
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.340
Almost everything want to do in
Nginx someone has done before.

23
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.140
So that's a better way to go.

24
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.120
However, if you really want to,
read the docs.

25
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.750
I don't recommend it.

26
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.980
You can also use the man page,
I don't recommend that either.

27
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.180
[LAUGH] But it's there if you need it.

28
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.919
And we'll talk more
about that in a second.

29
00:01:32.348 --> 00:01:35.057
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So with Nginx configuration
there's a lot of different things,

30
00:01:35.057 --> 00:01:37.660
I'm gonna try to highlight them today.

31
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.650
The bass directory for

32
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.020
all requests are going to go to
slash var dub dub dub slash HTML.

33
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.660
That's where all requests
are going to go by default.

34
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.330
And we're going to keep that
directory cuz it's just

35
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.270
the nice place to keep all your web stuff.

36
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.020
You can move around if you want,
but slash var slash dub dub dub is

37
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.940
usually where people keep most of their
applications and things like that.

38
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.450
But you can move it to wherever you want.

39
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.700
A location block is just saying for

40
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.562
every request that comes into the server,
what should I do?

41
00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:10.470
And Nginx regular expressions here,

42
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.860
in this case it's just slash it's
gonna match everything coming in.

43
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.920
It's gonna try to serve the file,
so it's gonna serve one of these.

44
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.254
And if it doesn't,
it's just gonna 404 page.

45
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.450
We're gonna use the location
blocks slash for

46
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.000
most of the things we're gonna do today.

47
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.250
We're not gonna create paths or
subdomains or things like that.

48
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.280
But that's just called a location block.

49
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.670
This try underscore files,
it's what's known as a directive in Nginx.

50
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.050
Essentially, it's a called a macro for
doing something.

51
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.510
The one we're gonna use a little bit later
is proxy past which we'll talk about.

52
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.310
And that's gonna proxy your request
to some other part of the server.

53
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.370
But try files just means it's gonna
try to look up one of these files.

54
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.000
And if it can't any of them,
it's gonna 404 page.

55
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.970
It's gonna say error, right?

56
00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.050
So here we are, we have a server
block in Nginx configuration.

57
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.760
It's a default server, so
it's listing on port 80.

58
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.390
All this stuff's there.

59
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.619
There's a root directory, the server name,
which we'll change later,

60
00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.234
but for now we don't need to
because it's the default server

61
00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:13.800
still accepting connections
from everywhere.

62
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.320
Here's a location block.

63
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.930
You can ignore the rest of this for now.

64
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.380
This is your Nginx configuration.

65
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.590
So let's tweak it a little bit and
quit just q.

66
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.990
So for now, that default page
came out of magic mystery land.

67
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.600
Let's go and create one and then edit
it to change to whatever you want.

68
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.420
It's going to change the default page
because that way you know your directories

69
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.090
are working, and the files are working,
and it's serving correctly.

70
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.740
So, sudo vi/var/www/html and
then create an index.html page.

71
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.290
So, I'm going to go ahead and
do that here.

72
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.985
Sudo

73
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.390
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I know what you're thinking
that's not proper HTML, doesn't matter.

74
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.460
It will work.

75
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.830
If I try to do anything fancy,
like styling, it's gonna break.

76
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.940
But for now, you don't have
to write an entire HTML page.

77
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.060
If we had more time, I'd say who can
create the best HTML page in 10 minutes.

78
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.075
And I feel bad cuz I beat you.

79
00:04:20.075 --> 00:04:23.450
So, I'm kidding, I wouldn't,
that is not my forte.

80
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.510
This is more my area of expertise.

81
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.030
But we're just going to wq that and
when we

82
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.510
refresh our page before we now have a
different page because instead of looking

83
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.440
to that default Nginx page, it's looking
in order in index dot HTML comes in order.

84
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.260
Everybody here so far?

85
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.320
Cool.

86
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.670
Now we're doing something, we are now
serving an HTML page on our own server.

87
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.770
I know little things.

88
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:50.850
I think it's cool.

89
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.350
Good job.
