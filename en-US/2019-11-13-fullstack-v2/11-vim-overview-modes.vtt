00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.798
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's talk about VIM.

2
00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:05.650
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: VIM stands for Vi Improved,

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.113
it's one of those meta-definitions
kind of like PHP.

4
00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:12.167
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: What does PHP stand for,
anybody?

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.302
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's like
one of these nerd jerks.

6
00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:22.216
PHP stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor,

7
00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:28.402
it's a self-referential definition,
just like Vi Improved, VIM.

8
00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:32.760
But what it is, it's text editor?

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.250
VI is powerful because it's
on almost every server.

10
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.840
So if you wanna edit a file,
you have to do that somehow.

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.710
Again, these are things that when I
was starting off I took for granted.

12
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.410
Of course, I can just open it in my
VS Code or sublime or a web storm or

13
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.580
whatever IT are using.

14
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.120
Servers will have any of that,
you can probably install it but

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.300
if you have 1,000 servers,
it's probably be a hassle.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.387
VI is gonna be on every server you have,
so it's a good thing to use to edit

17
00:00:59.387 --> 00:01:02.471
files which primarily it's
always use it engineers,

18
00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:06.378
we just edit files, we create new
files we edit them then we run them.

19
00:01:08.037 --> 00:01:10.897
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So, to start VI,
well, actually enforce our VI you

20
00:01:10.897 --> 00:01:14.992
should know about the modes and this
seems really intimidating at first but

21
00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:17.277
it will make sense when we start using it.

22
00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.940
It has insert mode and
that's for editing text.

23
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.790
It has command mode.

24
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.560
That's for doing things like copy,
paste, find, things like that.

25
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.190
It has last line mode for searching,
saving, exiting, other things like that.

26
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.470
It seems really confusing
that there is three modes.

27
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.730
But, when you think about what a GUI does,
it actually has multiple modes as well.

28
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.439
You just don't notice it cuz it's
all in one single interface.

29
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.410
The great thing about VI
is you can't use a mouse.

30
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.200
It forces you to not use a mouse.

31
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.867
I mean, I'm sure there's plugins
that let you use a mouse.

32
00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:51.637
But, if you're really good at VI,

33
00:01:51.637 --> 00:01:55.064
you're gonna be much faster than
someone with a mouse and keyboard.

34
00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:57.818
Because a mouse, you don't think
about it but you're typing,

35
00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:00.215
and then you wanna do something,
you move your mouse and

36
00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.360
you click and you save and
you drag and search and right click.

37
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.370
VIM, you don't do any of that,
it's all in the keyboard.

38
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.870
So you just switch.

39
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.348
And so now it's really,
really fast at VI is gonna be really,

40
00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:16.102
really fast, the problem is to
get good at them, it takes years.

41
00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:18.662
I know someone that did it and
it took them at least a year and

42
00:02:18.662 --> 00:02:22.570
a half to become like to a level that
they're like, I'm comfortable with it.

43
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.829
But now when I see him,
he's flying around.

44
00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.730
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Not for
me, I still use VS Code.

45
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.560
[LAUGH] I am not that nerd level.

46
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.040
But, we're gonna learn VIM today
because that's the text editor.

47
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.565
We're gonna be use the editing
files on the server.

48
00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:37.335
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And to gets those modes,
insert mode is gonna be i,

49
00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:41.175
command mode you use ESC, and
last line mode is just the colon.

50
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.341
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: How to quit VIM?

51
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:49.072
This is one of the most popular questions
on stack overflow because it's easy

52
00:02:49.072 --> 00:02:50.800
to get into them.

53
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.052
And everything you know won't work,
so Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D,

54
00:02:55.052 --> 00:02:57.605
any ESC multiple times won't work.

55
00:02:57.605 --> 00:03:01.143
So, if you're ever stuck ESC :q!,

56
00:03:01.143 --> 00:03:05.905
bang with the also known
as the exclamation point.

57
00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:09.579
The bang is just in case you wrote
something and it'll force you to save it.

58
00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.332
It'll ask you if you wanna save,

59
00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:14.228
you'll get stuck the bang
just means like quit, yes.

60
00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:18.446
[LAUGH] The pages means, guess I know
what I'm doing, this is what I wanna do.

61
00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:23.240
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: These are cheat seats,
don't worry about memorizing them.

62
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.089
Honestly, if I'm in VIM and I try to do
something, I'd probably look it up too.

63
00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:28.940
But you'll get the basics
down pretty quickly.

64
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.240
Like yesterday, in saving a file,
finding things, things like that.

65
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.560
But feel free to reference
back to this page.

66
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.400
The copy/paste on the Wikia for
VIM is pretty useful.

67
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.106
But these slides are here is a reference.

68
00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:44.320
We're not gonna dive too deep into
the specific commands because again,

69
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.000
it's a really, really powerful text editor
