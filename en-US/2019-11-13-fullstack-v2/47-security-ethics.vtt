00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.763
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: There is a,
which team is it?

2
00:00:01.763 --> 00:00:05.215
I forget what they're called at Google.

3
00:00:05.215 --> 00:00:09.675
If you ask me what my dream job is, if I
was in security, it's the Google X Team or

4
00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.380
something like that.

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.920
And their job is only to hack or

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.190
try to find zero days in software,
then they let the manufacturer know.

7
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.410
And they do that as
being white hat hackers.

8
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.075
And it's kind of like doing
good in the world, which is,

9
00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:24.972
it's really cool that that job exists.

10
00:00:24.972 --> 00:00:29.515
But one of the issues is about,
when it comes to security,

11
00:00:29.515 --> 00:00:33.316
is if I'm a security researcher and
I say, hey,

12
00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:39.000
Frontend Masters,
you have a security hole in your software.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.720
And I tell you about that,
what responsibility do I have?

14
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.990
Cuz essentially, I found a zero day.

15
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.790
And I tell you and
you don't do anything about that.

16
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.390
What do I do?

17
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.765
What should I do?

18
00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:51.024
I didn't think we were gonna
talk about ethics today.

19
00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:52.880
But let's talk a little bit about ethics.

20
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.920
So, what is the responsibility
of companies?

21
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.030
If I say hey, I found a bug in your
bank software or something like that.

22
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.614
What do you think?

23
00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:04.421
Cuz this is a discussion, you know?

24
00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:11.252
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Patch it,
they should patch the defect.

25
00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:14.979
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But what if they don't?

26
00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.393
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: A set amount of time and

27
00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:20.650
then you kind of put them on blast
on Twitter something to pressure.

28
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.182
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, and now we get
into a really ethically gray area, and

29
00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:30.080
that's why security is, I spend so much
time on it cuz it's really interesting.

30
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.276
Yeah, if I say, Marc Grabanski,
CEO of Frontend Masters,

31
00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:36.494
I emailed you that there's
a bug on frontendmasters.com.

32
00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:40.010
And I emailed you 30 days ago and
you didn't fix it yet.

33
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.110
And that means if I found it,
someone else can find it and

34
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.720
they can be exploiting it now and I think
it's your responsibility to fix that.

35
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.940
And if they don't,
at that point I can say publicly,

36
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.140
hey, there's a bug on frontendmasters.com
and I can shame them publicly.

37
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.265
Which is ethically dubious,

38
00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:57.950
cuz at that point I just released
this vulnerability to everybody.

39
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.320
And if they still don't fix it, now the
entire world knows that this hole exists.

40
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.408
And that's why security researcher is
a really, it's a really tricky area.

41
00:02:06.408 --> 00:02:10.212
Because at what point, like what
if it's a really complicated bug,

42
00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:13.440
what if it takes them more
than 30 days to fix it?

43
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.560
And I still release it anyways.

44
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.860
That's not fair to them, but
they should also fix the hole, too.

45
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.420
Yes, Jeff.

46
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.720
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Well, I was gonna say, depending
on the complexity of the vulnerability and

47
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.440
how many people are potentially affected.

48
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.840
As I understand it,
there's a different set of standards for

49
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.404
how urgently you expect
a company to respond.

50
00:02:36.404 --> 00:02:40.499
And the other thing is, you can also
announce after a certain amount of time,

51
00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:44.546
whether it's a month or six months,
you can say, hey, we've found a bug.

52
00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:47.529
You don't have to say where it is or
how to exploit it.

53
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.230
Versus six months or a year later,
it's like, by the way,

54
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.950
this is where we found the bug.

55
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.410
And here's some available GitHub repos, so

56
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.670
that any script kiddy could compromise it,
to show just how easy it is.

57
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.639
I mean, there's a graduated response
rather than just all or nothing.

58
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.660
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, but
even there it gets so

59
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.940
ethically dubious because what if I say
there's a bug with your login protocol.

60
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.520
And I just announce that to the world, cuz
they haven't fixed it in 30 days, 90 days.

61
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.210
That's enough that enough people
are gonna start hammering on that and

62
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.270
they're probably gonna find
that vulnerability too.

63
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.350
So even then, even if you're
trying to do the right thing,

64
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.370
you can still get in trouble.

65
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.070
There's no right answer to this.

66
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.294
Google's team response is they
give 90 days to the company.

67
00:03:37.294 --> 00:03:40.161
So they'll tell you about it and
if you don't fix it in 90 days,

68
00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:42.051
they'll release that out into the world.

69
00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:45.820
And it's kind of like a naming and
shaming type thing.

70
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.930
Which again,
if the company doesn't respond,

71
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.460
you've just released this bug out into the
world that anybody can take advantage of.

72
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.460
And especially when you start
chaining these zero days together,

73
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.260
you can blow up nuclear reactors,
things like that.

74
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.870
Yes.

75
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.477
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: The scariest one for
me is the medical device ones.

76
00:04:01.477 --> 00:04:07.452
Because at DEFCON they'll do a thing,
a presentation,

77
00:04:07.452 --> 00:04:13.686
here's how you make this
pacemaker kill someone, right?

78
00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:18.730
And some of the medical device companies
don't take security seriously.

79
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.600
So I don't know,
that freaks me out anyways.

80
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.027
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It should,
you should all be freaked out by security.

81
00:04:26.027 --> 00:04:27.413
And when there's hacks and

82
00:04:27.413 --> 00:04:31.519
breaches, we should all collectively
hold these companies more accountable.

83
00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:36.053
Sorry, this is totally tangent, but
because I care about these sort of things.

84
00:04:36.053 --> 00:04:39.621
Equifax, they have your Social Security
number, all of your credit history,

85
00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:43.800
which essentially I can figure out who
you are by just how you spend your money.

86
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.790
They got hacked and their consequences
were so minimal for this data that nobody

87
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.930
asked them to collect and nobody asked
them to monetize, and nothing happened.

88
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.250
So honestly, I think it's up to us as
engineers in the private sector to take

89
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.560
these things more seriously and
hold companies accountable.

90
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.960
So if you see your company
has bad security practice,

91
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.220
you should say something.

92
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.886
See something, say something.

93
00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:08.410
[LAUGH] Anyways,
that was a tangent on security.

94
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.490
But what we've learned so
far is keep your software up to date.

95
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.290
That's one of the easiest
things you can do,

96
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.130
with the unattended upgrades,
it does it for you.
