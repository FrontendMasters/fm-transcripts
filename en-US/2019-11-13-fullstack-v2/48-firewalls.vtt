1
00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:02.833
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: What is a firewall?

2
00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:04.602
Don't look at the definition yet.

3
00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:05.169
What is a firewall?

4
00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:07.701
You've probably heard the term before.

5
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:08.355
Yeah.

6
00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:12.701
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's network security
infrastructure that either allows or

7
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:14.044
blocks requests.

8
00:00:14.044 --> 00:00:15.191
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

9
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:16.733
Sam that you say?

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:20.263
&gt;&gt; Sam: No,
it's a perimeter security technique, so

11
00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:26.003
you either allow requests in or out
depending on how they're originating and

12
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:29.549
what port they're on and
what the protocol is.

13
00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:31.959
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
what she said, more verbose.

14
00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:34.910
I like it, you can never be too
verbose when you're defining things.

15
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.551
A firewall, the phrase comes from the
actual physical device called a firewall,

16
00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:40.971
your car has a firewall.

17
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:43.397
So between the engine and
where you sit in your car,

18
00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:45.209
that's what's known as a firewall.

19
00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:47.811
So if the engine gets on fire,
the fire won't spread into the engine.

20
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:52.816
Or it will slow down enough building have
firewalls so that if there is a fire it

21
00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:58.284
doesn't prevent things completely, it just
slows it down enough so you can fix it.

22
00:00:58.284 --> 00:00:59.319
And that's what a firewall does.

23
00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:00.543
They are not invulnerable,

24
00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:03.808
there's always ways around them cuz
everybody's running a firewall now.

25
00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:05.972
But people still get hacked.

26
00:01:05.972 --> 00:01:09.903
But it's enough to slow people down and
deter people.

27
00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.692
I'll use the Cisco definition, and
it's pretty much what everybody said.

28
00:01:13.692 --> 00:01:18.491
It's a network secure device that monitors
incoming and outgoing network traffic and

29
00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:22.828
it decides whether or not to block that
traffic based on certain frequencies,

30
00:01:22.828 --> 00:01:24.950
there's a certain set of standards.

31
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.705
There is software firewalls and
there's hardware firewalls.

32
00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.531
Generally most people
are running our consumer grade.

33
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:34.276
We're all running software firewalls.

34
00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:38.870
Our Mac OS X has a firewall built
in Windows has firewall built in.

35
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.100
It's because we don't wanna open
all of our ports to everybody.

36
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.153
Because if you do that, it doesn't
matter if your like, I'm using SSH and

37
00:01:46.153 --> 00:01:48.707
there's nothing else my
system worth stealing.

38
00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:51.578
There could be
a vulnerability in there and

39
00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:54.540
it's just narrowing that attack surface.

40
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.567
And an image of a firewall.

41
00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:56.262
I like that.

42
00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:07.256
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So let's run nmap
because I talked about ports earlier.

43
00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:12.538
An nmap is a port scanner and
what it does is it can run over an entire

44
00:02:12.538 --> 00:02:17.069
range of IP addresses and
it just checks for open ports.

45
00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.298
So first thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna install nmap.

46
00:02:21.873 --> 00:02:27.084
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Sudo apt install nmap
if it's not already installed.

47
00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:31.476
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So sudo apt install

48
00:02:44.943 --> 00:02:48.452
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I'm gonna grab
the IP address of my server.

49
00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:51.726
So, it's here.

50
00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:52.461
Copy that.

51
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:01.822
&gt;&gt; Sam: You intending that we run this
locally against our server remotely or

52
00:03:01.822 --> 00:03:02.986
from the server.

53
00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:05.868
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: You could run on the server,
you can run it from not your server.

54
00:03:05.868 --> 00:03:07.690
It actually doesn't matter in this case.

55
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.308
But running it yeah, running it locally
you should know where your ports are.

56
00:03:10.308 --> 00:03:11.689
But it's just a good visualization.

57
00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:21.830
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes and Sam is right where
we're on our server running against our

58
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.413
own server.

59
00:03:22.413 --> 00:03:25.145
You can log out of your server and
run against your server and

60
00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:26.517
the results will be the same.

61
00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:40.249
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And right now you're
probably seeing something along that

62
00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:42.147
you should see actually exactly this.

63
00:03:42.147 --> 00:03:44.234
You have port 22 open, that's SSH.

64
00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:46.482
So, that's allows us to log in and
out our server.

65
00:03:46.482 --> 00:03:49.277
We port 80 which is our http server.

66
00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:53.935
And then we have port 3000 because
it's open by default when we

67
00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:56.022
started our express server.

68
00:03:56.022 --> 00:03:59.738
Now let's run nmap with sV to
get a little bit more detail.

69
00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:09.596
So nmap
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

70
00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:10.825
this is gonna take a little bit more time.

71
00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:15.046
The sV command is gonna give us more
detail about what exact processes

72
00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:18.851
are running on those and
services are running on those ports.

73
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:23.579
And it might take

74
00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:27.634
a second ago.

75
00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:32.050
So, port 22 is pretty
pretty much always SSH.

76
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.684
It's the default 48 windows HTTP.

77
00:04:34.684 --> 00:04:38.683
For 3000 was a random port we chose
just for our express middle ware.

78
00:04:38.683 --> 00:04:45.259
But running this open source command
allows me to port scan an IP address.

79
00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:51.053
But not only that, it tells me the exact
software and version that they're running.

80
00:04:51.053 --> 00:04:52.496
So why is that useful?

81
00:04:52.496 --> 00:04:55.427
Or why that dangerous?

82
00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:55.962
Yes.

83
00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:59.007
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: it's very easy to
look up known vulnerabilities and

84
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.743
start trying to get through.

85
00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:08.504
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Precisely, if there
was a known exploit for NGINX 1.14.

86
00:05:08.504 --> 00:05:10.785
I can find that out really, really easily.

87
00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:15.720
And then you say like, no one will know
if I haven't patched my NGINX version.

88
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.272
They do,
people are running at port all the time.

89
00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:23.326
It takes very little CPU resources now to
run a port scan over the entire Internet,

90
00:05:23.326 --> 00:05:25.283
and people are doing this constantly.

91
00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.875
So if you have a vulnerability,
eventually, people will find it and

92
00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:28.734
they will exploit it.

93
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.852
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And what nmap won't show
is they won't show all the close ports.

94
00:05:36.852 --> 00:05:39.629
They only gonna show the open ports but
you can scan for closed ports.

95
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.300
It's not really much of a point for
that as well.
