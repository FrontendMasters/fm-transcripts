00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:02.196
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So one way of
keeping your software secure, or

2
00:00:02.196 --> 00:00:05.205
keeping your computer secure,
is preventing these zero days.

3
00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.983
So the minute an exploit comes out,
you want to keep your software up to date.

4
00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:12.737
And we can do this with a program
called Unattended Upgrades.

5
00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:17.564
What it does is it automatically upgrades
your software for security or minor fixes.

6
00:00:17.564 --> 00:00:19.758
So let's go ahead and
install that now on our computer.

7
00:00:19.758 --> 00:00:22.223
So sudo.

8
00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:24.456
apt install unattended-upgrades.

9
00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:46.504
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Do that

10
00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:54.287
here.

11
00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:56.738
And generally with modern
Ubuntu distributions,

12
00:00:56.738 --> 00:00:59.937
it's already installed because
they're trying to help you out.

13
00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:04.230
Every version of Ubuntu gets a little bit
better, a little bit more user friendly.

14
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.011
And let's just check on the conf file.

15
00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:10.277
We're not gonna modify it today, but it's
good to know that these conf files exist.

16
00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:13.804
So I'm gonna say less,

17
00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.703
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: /etc/ apt, apt.conf.d, and

18
00:01:21.703 --> 00:01:27.089
we'll go with 50 unattended upgrades.

19
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.939
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: For an
etc/APT/APT.conf.d/unattendedupgrades and

20
00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.366
these are just configuration files for
the programs, for

21
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:51.255
apps and in this particular
instance it runs in the background.

22
00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:54.677
So what it does is because most of
their everything's commented out,

23
00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:55.953
other than the security.

24
00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:59.020
And distribution for
the main distribution,

25
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.225
which usually doesn't happen.

26
00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:04.597
There's not usually a major
push on LTS version.

27
00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:08.142
And I don't know what ESM is,
but I think it's okay.

28
00:02:08.142 --> 00:02:10.031
But the main one we want
is the security upgrades.

29
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:13.451
So every time there's a bug and
exploit discovered in Ubuntu,

30
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:17.594
your computer is automatically going
to pull in the latest changes for you.

31
00:02:17.594 --> 00:02:19.053
This is really helpful.

32
00:02:19.053 --> 00:02:22.436
When I first started out,
this didn't really exist.

33
00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:26.551
So I had to run a cron job which is
a job that runs on a daily cycle or

34
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:31.446
whatever I established it to be and
automatically install these things but

35
00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:34.575
with unintended upgrades,
it does it for you.

36
00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:38.755
And that's, that's just a a really nice
feature that we should all enable if it's

37
00:02:38.755 --> 00:02:40.619
not already enabled in your system.

38
00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.761
Always make sure your system has
a way of staying up to date.

39
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:47.999
Windows Update, I think Windows 10,
they had a zero day release the other day,

40
00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.526
it was from a video drive or
something like that.

41
00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:54.218
So again, always keep your
software up to date if you can.

42
00:02:54.218 --> 00:02:56.873
But don't necessarily jump on
the latest version of something.

43
00:02:56.873 --> 00:02:59.915
But stay on the latest patches and fixes.

44
00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:00.635
Yes.

45
00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:04.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So to clarify,
once you run this installer,

46
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.961
that's going to essentially be
an autopilot and it will automatically

47
00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:14.045
delete auto installer or auto upgrader
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

48
00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:17.393
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
what's the frequency of that schedule?

49
00:03:17.393 --> 00:03:20.336
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I don't know,
I think it checks probably daily.

50
00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:24.107
It just checks the apt repo and
says is there an update to this?

51
00:03:24.107 --> 00:03:25.976
If so, pull it in and install it.

52
00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:29.962
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So theoretically you
would still be vulnerable to zero days.

53
00:03:29.962 --> 00:03:30.923
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

54
00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:32.268
Which is why they're called a zero day.

55
00:03:32.268 --> 00:03:34.449
If they were called a one day,

56
00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.389
that would be enough to give
you enough time to fix it.

57
00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.711
If it's a zero day and your system is
running, then it's not patched yet

58
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:44.283
because the manufacturer
doesn't even know about it.

59
00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:46.800
Hence the zero part of it.
