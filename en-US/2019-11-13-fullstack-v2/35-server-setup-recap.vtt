00:00:00.427 --> 00:00:03.910
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That was an adventure,
that was a big adventure.

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.168
So hopefully, you've got it committed,
you can now work on it,

3
00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:10.978
anybody can work on it, you can tweak
your server to your heart's content.

4
00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:14.433
And we did it, that was day one.

5
00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:18.220
So recap, what did we learn?

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.270
We learned how the Internet works.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.790
We learned how to connect an IP
to a domain, to a server,

8
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.400
to a web server, to an application server,
and serve out data.

9
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.358
We learned how to configure Nginx a bit,
we learned how to configure Git a bit.

10
00:00:35.358 --> 00:00:40.360
[LAUGH] If you want some further
exploration, you can install Fail2ban.

11
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.400
Fail2ban, do you remember earlier
how we solve the auth log, and

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.330
like people always trying
to get in my server?

13
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.730
Fail2ban is a log parcel essentially
that it reads a lot of attempts, so

14
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.680
if someone attempts to login five times
it's invalid, it's gonna ban them

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.970
completely, so you can't even give
a valid login if you want to.

16
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.680
And that's useful for
stopping script those

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.390
are people that just download scripts and
then run them against lots of websites.

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.703
Fail2ban is pretty useful, I don't go into
it in this course, even though I used to,

19
00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.964
just because for learning,
it's probably not that important.

20
00:01:13.964 --> 00:01:15.602
But if you're sending it for
real production server,

21
00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:18.520
you're almost gonna always wanna
have Fail2ban or something similar.

22
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.080
And if you wanna do Express,

23
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.200
Express.js has a really good
site on performance tips.

24
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.380
So it tells you how to tune an Nginx
a bit, how to set up caching,

25
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.880
tells you all about varnish,

26
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.590
Nginx caching, tells you how to set up
the headers correctly, things like that.

27
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.130
That's good reading too, if you want
to start messing about with Express and

28
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.878
you have not before.

29
00:01:35.878 --> 00:01:37.756
But now, we're at the end, so

30
00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:42.309
you have a lot more energy now cuz i
started off here and now I'm about here,

31
00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:46.947
because I'm a night person a 100% all day,
I do my best coding at night.

32
00:01:46.947 --> 00:01:48.687
Are there any questions?

33
00:01:48.687 --> 00:01:51.730
Anything you wanna know more about?

34
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't know if this will
take up too much time, but I removed my

35
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.580
node modules, and now I'm wondering
how to create that git ignore file?

36
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.803
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So vi.gitignore.

37
00:02:01.803 --> 00:02:02.718
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mm-hm.

38
00:02:02.718 --> 00:02:05.990
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Did you manage
it there as well, sir?

39
00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:11.938
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, I created that,
now I'm just stuck trying to push.

40
00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:16.199
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH]
I may come just look at your computer,

41
00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.290
we'll see where we're at.

42
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
then I would put the node models

43
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.683
in there-
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes,

44
00:02:22.683 --> 00:02:26.111
you add node underscore modules slash-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Slash, okay?

45
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:29.606
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: For now, as long as
you remove those node modules and

46
00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:33.897
push that change up to Github,
and then add the git ignore firs,

47
00:02:33.897 --> 00:02:36.910
it depends on the order you did things.

48
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:37.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, remove them,

49
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.070
I'm adding this, and
then should I [INAUDIBLE] after this?

50
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.952
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
to keep it up and running.

51
00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:44.045
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, all right.

52
00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:47.774
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So a bit of a recap,
we learned that it's not magic between

53
00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:51.974
the frontend and the backend,
in fact, it's a lot of glue work.

54
00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:56.051
It's a lot of underappreciated work
that goes from making a domain connect

55
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:59.105
to a server, and
that server serve out an application.

56
00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:02.878
And in fact, what we learned
was how the Internet works,

57
00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:08.500
we learned that there's a domain that
looks up the IP address via name server.

58
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.060
The name server returns the IP that passes
off to a node, and the node passes off,

59
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.960
and pass it off, and pass it off,
and eventually hits a server.

60
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.230
That server says, what do I want
do this quest we tried to go?

61
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.231
And then it passes off to a web server,
that was server is Nginx yesterday.

62
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.520
And then it passes to
an application server,

63
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.300
and the application server was Express.js,
that's where we all landed.

64
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.000
And if you're thinking that was a lot
of words, just do this, yeah, it is.

65
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But today, we're gonna learn
some faster ways of doing this,

66
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.610
some ways that we don't have to do
this manually every single time.

67
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.677
But as always, if you're learning
something, it's good to go manually step

68
00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:45.822
by step by step, so
you understand exactly what we do.

69
00:03:45.822 --> 00:03:49.322
Yesterday we also learned
some command line basic,

70
00:03:49.322 --> 00:03:53.620
we came a little familiar,
we didn't use the mouse as much.

71
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.800
And if you're an UI engineer,
you probably use the mouse

72
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.640
the least of all you ever did possible for
an entire day.

73
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.090
We also learned how the Internet works,
we learned how to create and

74
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.846
manage web server, and we created
a pretty basic node application.

75
00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:13.080
Today, we're gonna do things that
are a bit more advanced, and

76
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.226
I have a final projects,
I think it's gonna be pretty fun.

77
00:04:16.226 --> 00:04:20.164
[INAUDIBLE] hotel room dot JS because
I wrote it last time at hotel room,

78
00:04:20.164 --> 00:04:22.717
I think we're gonna have
a lot of fun with it.

79
00:04:22.717 --> 00:04:27.081
But now, we have this common baseline,
so we can do things that are a bit more,

80
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:30.853
I wanna say interesting cuz that I
don't wanna make the first part,

81
00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:34.050
it seem a little dull but
they'll be a bit more advanced.
