00:00:00.473 --> 00:00:02.398
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So let's give it a shot.

2
00:00:02.398 --> 00:00:07.609
We're not gonna do too much yet,
but memorize or understand how

3
00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:13.513
to do these commands like how to type,
how to edit, how to save and quit.

4
00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.388
Because we will be using
them pretty much all day.

5
00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:18.048
It sounds intimidating.

6
00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:20.614
It won't be well, we'll go really slow.

7
00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:25.164
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So to fire up vim,
you can type in vi,

8
00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:29.354
the man pages again just to
show you that what we're doing.

9
00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:32.593
I don't like to give you commands and
you don't understand why.

10
00:00:32.593 --> 00:00:36.833
So I'll just do it now,
clear, and I'll type in vi.

11
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:39.575
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Nothing to it.

12
00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:42.864
Now we're in a text editor.

13
00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:43.930
Let's say I wanna type something.

14
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.640
So right now I'm in command mode so
I can just say i, and

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.417
at the bottom screen here we see insert,
means we're in insert mode.

16
00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:58.145
Hello, and to get out of insert mode,
hit Escape.

17
00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:00.892
And now I'm no longer in insert mode,
right?

18
00:01:00.892 --> 00:01:02.314
We've got this so far.

19
00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:05.756
It's intimidating until you
start playing around with it.

20
00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:11.027
So to get into last line mode,
I'm gonna hit Shift+colon.

21
00:01:11.027 --> 00:01:14.025
See there's a colon here
at the bottom screen.

22
00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:18.029
And to quit, I can say q,
but it's not gonna let me,

23
00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:22.500
thus the Q bang if I wanna override,
but I don't quit yet.

24
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.453
Let's say I want to save this file,
as, something, I don't know.

25
00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:30.556
So I can say wq, I didn't give it a file
name, and I'm not gonna name this one.

26
00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:32.859
So I'm just gonna say q quit.

27
00:01:36.038 --> 00:01:37.957
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Did everybody
managed to get in and get out?

28
00:01:37.957 --> 00:01:41.819
That's, [LAUGH] probably 90% of it is
just getting in inserting something and

29
00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:42.514
getting out.

30
00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:45.298
If I wanna create a filename, actually,

31
00:01:45.298 --> 00:01:48.568
I think we'll do it on the next exercise,
yeah.

32
00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:50.303
So let's create a file.

33
00:01:50.303 --> 00:01:53.230
I could say, vi call temp.

34
00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:59.912
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So now I'm in the new file,
I'll say, go into insert mode,

35
00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:01.710
say hello, everyone.

36
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.959
Exclamation points and
to write quit say wq.

37
00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:08.714
It means write and quit.

38
00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:14.778
If I just wanna save I hit write,
can't open file for writing, what?

39
00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:20.061
wq, try that, I don't know why
it's not letting me write.

40
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:21.997
I know why.

41
00:02:21.997 --> 00:02:24.520
This we are gonna learn
a lesson in permissions.

42
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.026
So right now I'm in root directory,
so I'm going on a tangent, and

43
00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:31.546
you can't write things in root directory,
it just won't let you.

44
00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:37.222
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cd~ and
what this means is it's

45
00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:42.298
just change directory and
this is just shortcut for home.

46
00:02:42.298 --> 00:02:49.043
So now if I do pwd, I'm in my home
directory, now I can write files freely.

47
00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:53.776
Almost, actually not almost, no operating
system is gonna let you write in root,

48
00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:56.623
in the root directory,
just cuz it's a bad idea.

49
00:02:56.623 --> 00:03:00.250
[LAUGH] You don't wanna mess in here cuz
this is the base of your computer and

50
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.896
if you start writing files left and
right, bad idea.

51
00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:06.513
So always we wanna make sure we're
just in our home directory or

52
00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:08.023
some working directory.

53
00:03:08.023 --> 00:03:10.786
And ls, we can see we're in our directory.

54
00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:14.800
So now, vi temp, and

55
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.827
now I can write Hello everyone!

56
00:03:20.827 --> 00:03:25.180
And w quits, save,
if I wanna take a look at that,

57
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.202
I can say cat temp, nothing to it.

58
00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:32.513
I can use less temp, Hello everyone!

59
00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:35.296
Nothing to see, q to quit.

60
00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:38.150
All right, everybody in, out,
edited a file, saved it?

61
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.181
Cool, we'll be doing more of that later.

62
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:43.657
So I don't wanna spend
too much time on it.

63
00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:48.029
But you will get stuck probably and you're
gonna get stuck with bad permissions or

64
00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:49.244
something like that.

65
00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:52.931
Just let me know if you do or reference
back the slides and make sure when you

66
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:56.699
write a file, you're in the right
directory with the right permissions.

67
00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:57.471
So that was vim.

68
00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:59.282
I just spent a lot more time on it.

69
00:03:59.282 --> 00:04:02.710
But then I realized,
you learn by doing not by me telling you.
