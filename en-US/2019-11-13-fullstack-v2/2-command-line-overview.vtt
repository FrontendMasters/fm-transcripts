00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.030
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We'll start
with the command line.

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.250
Anybody know what command line is?

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.650
Assuming everybody.

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.390
Yeah, it looks something like this.

5
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.700
I'm gonna switch over.

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.739
So I can say, echo hi.

7
00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.138
Says, hi.

8
00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:18.450
Groundbreaking stuff here.

9
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.460
A lot of what we're gonna do
today is on the command line.

10
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.610
Actually, most of what we're gonna
do today is on the command line.

11
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.090
And it's a little intimidating for people.

12
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.310
Especially if you're just using your mouse
and inspecting and all these things.

13
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.220
But by the end of the day,
you're gonna love the command line.

14
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.060
You'll see it's so powerful,
it's so repeatable.

15
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.285
And really, you can just throw
that mouse out right now.

16
00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:41.889
Anybody have a mouse?

17
00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:43.832
No, just kidding.

18
00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:44.993
Don't do that at home.

19
00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:46.921
I don't wanna get blamed for that.

20
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.502
But today we're gonna be really
comfortable with command line.

21
00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:52.408
And we're gonna see, it's just a user
interface, just like anything else.

22
00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.390
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So why the command line?

23
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.840
Anybody, why the command line?

24
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.710
I'm gonna ask a lot of questions today,
so just get used to it.

25
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.752
Wait, I already heard from you.

26
00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:05.520
Taylor?

27
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not all
servers even have a GUI.

28
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.350
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, good answer,
that's exactly right.

29
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There's just no limitation.

30
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.584
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exactly.

31
00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:18.103
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No matter how
well designed a GUI is,

32
00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:22.190
you just cannot encompass
all the possibilities.

33
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.040
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

34
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That are capable
in a command line.

35
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.600
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Perfect,
great answers, everyone.

36
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.413
And I love that you all said GUI.

37
00:01:30.413 --> 00:01:34.886
GUI stands for graphical user interface,
for those who are unfamiliar and

38
00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:35.812
never seen it.

39
00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:38.890
But GUIs are opinionated.

40
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.910
It's someone's opinion about what
exactly the user should see and

41
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.480
how they should interact with that.

42
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.616
And how its laid out is
completely contextual.

43
00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:49.256
In a different country, maybe I
wouldn't understand their GUI at all.

44
00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:52.320
Because I'm used to the buttons being
on this side instead of this side.

45
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.640
The command line is ubiquitous.

46
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.616
The command line works in every
language in every country.

47
00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:03.287
Every operating system has a command line,
whether it Windows, Mac, or Linux.

48
00:02:03.287 --> 00:02:04.960
They all have command lines.

49
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.377
And if you're proficient at the command
line, if you're really good,

50
00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:11.973
I'm nowhere near this level, so
[LAUGH] I won't say that you'll be faster.

51
00:02:11.973 --> 00:02:14.860
But it is faster doing things on
the command line, generally speaking.

52
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.878
It's consistent, the command
line's always gonna be the same.

53
00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:22.460
The commands are generally gonna be
the same, if we're talking about Linux.

54
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.030
And honestly, it's easier to script,
it's easier to automate than GUIs.

55
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.300
And you can write GUIs to automate mouse
movements and all these other things.

56
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.380
But the command line is just,
it's where the power's at.

57
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.806
And originally, when computers were
first invented, it's all people had.

58
00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:40.729
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We'll just keep it there.

59
00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.550
All they had were were terminals
which access command line.

60
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.034
And there was no such thing as a GUI.

61
00:02:45.034 --> 00:02:49.594
That's why Windows 3.1 and Mac,
and all these things we take for

62
00:02:49.594 --> 00:02:51.926
granted now, were revelations.

63
00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:54.910
Because it made computers more accessible.

64
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.540
But if you go back to the old school days,

65
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.320
the place where platters on hard
drives were this big you could spin

66
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.070
them manually to get exactly where
you needed to be to access that data.

67
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.440
Those people were all using command
line and GUIs were just like, wow,

68
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.980
that'd be fantastic, maybe someday.
