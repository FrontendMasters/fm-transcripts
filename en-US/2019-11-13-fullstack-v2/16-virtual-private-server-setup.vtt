00:00:01.218 --> 00:00:03.306
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
when we size a server it's called a VPS,

2
00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:05.006
that's a Virtual Private Server.

3
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:09.529
Again because when you're manipulating it,
it looks like you have an entire server

4
00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:13.751
to yourself but in reality you just have
a chunk of a box, of a piece of a server.

5
00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:15.786
And I can pay five bucks a month and

6
00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:20.016
you get a chunk of a server rather
than having to run an entire server.

7
00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:24.282
And this is only possible through
the advantages of the way of threading and

8
00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:28.822
process isolation and honestly operating
systems have got better about having

9
00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:31.548
different processes
running at the same time.

10
00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:35.545
And we'll talk more about that tomorrow
when we talk about containers and

11
00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:39.422
why they are game changers in terms
of VPSs and how we wholly run things.

12
00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:44.380
But for today, just the basics,
we're not gonna get too complicated.

13
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.807
So today what we're gonna need is
we're gonna need to buy the VPS.

14
00:00:47.807 --> 00:00:51.821
So essentially we're
gonna buy server time.

15
00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:56.116
Fortunately, unlike last time,
I have my referral link in here.

16
00:00:56.116 --> 00:00:58.707
So if you use this
DigitalOcean referral link.

17
00:00:58.707 --> 00:01:00.138
You have to put in your credit card.

18
00:01:00.138 --> 00:01:03.136
But what you get is you get
$50 in free credits, and

19
00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:06.411
that's enough to run your server for
ten months for free.

20
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:09.656
So last time, I felt bad cuz you
had spend like five bucks or

21
00:01:09.656 --> 00:01:11.188
something to run a server.

22
00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:16.075
You'll get free credits, and I get free
credits so it's kind of a win win.

23
00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:20.891
So go ahead and go to DigitalOcean and
I'll walk you through

24
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:26.013
kind of which server you wanna
buy exactly what's happening.

25
00:01:26.013 --> 00:01:27.999
And if you already have a server running,

26
00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.995
probably buy another one because we want
a fresh server on the right installation.

27
00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:35.863
If you're on an old version of Ubuntu or
Fedora or something like that,

28
00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:38.383
commands are gonna be
a little bit different.

29
00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:43.155
I'm going to go to DigitalOcean.

30
00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:48.569
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: DigitalOcean account,
I logged in.

31
00:01:51.592 --> 00:01:53.250
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So I'll give you
a minute to walk through the sign up.

32
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.658
When you get through the sign up, and
if you don't already have an account,

33
00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.752
you'll be presented with
a screen like that.

34
00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.084
We'll actually call,
I'm gonna start a new project.

35
00:02:01.084 --> 00:02:02.950
You don't have to do this,
it's just for my sake.

36
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.506
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Stack front end to.

37
00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:23.034
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's okay,
it's educational purposes.

38
00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:28.721
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So now hopefully you're
all set up on DigitalOcean account.

39
00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:32.243
Putting credit card,
giving some free credits.

40
00:02:32.243 --> 00:02:34.616
I'll be getting some free
credits more importantly.

41
00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:37.748
And if you're wondering why choose
DigitalOcean as the host and

42
00:02:37.748 --> 00:02:39.841
provider cuz there's a lot of them there.

43
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:44.079
There's AWS, there's Azure,
there's lots of different types of hosts.

44
00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.788
I choose DigitalOcean because, to me, it
has the cleanest UI and the simplest UI.

45
00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:53.047
For example, this is AWS for
my website, it's hosted.

46
00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:56.516
So if you go to AWS you're like, what?

47
00:02:56.516 --> 00:02:58.501
What do I do now?

48
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:03.461
And you're like, I need to use an EC2
because EC2 is their virtual servers.

49
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:05.360
So you have to know that ahead of time.

50
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.691
And then you're like now I wanna start
an EC2 incidence, what do I wanna do?

51
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:16.598
You click launch incidence,
I don't get this.

52
00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:20.193
So for learning I wouldn't say
AWS is the best place to go.

53
00:03:20.193 --> 00:03:24.054
It's a bit more powerful and
AWS has more features than DigitalOcean.

54
00:03:24.054 --> 00:03:26.297
But for learning we're using DigitalOcean.

55
00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:29.701
That's why,
give you my reasoning yet things.

56
00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:31.600
So what we wanna do is get
started with the Droplets.

57
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.805
So just click Get Started with a Droplet,
they will start animation.

58
00:03:36.805 --> 00:03:37.955
And now you have to choose an image.

59
00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:42.777
An image is a copy of a base OS.

60
00:03:42.777 --> 00:03:49.558
So a baseline operating system and
baseline different types of CPU compute.

61
00:03:49.558 --> 00:03:51.139
You don't have to create a project,

62
00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.097
you can just create a droplet if you
wanna also click Create droplet.

63
00:03:54.097 --> 00:03:57.711
A droplet is their idea is stick
with an easy to use the VPS.

64
00:03:57.711 --> 00:04:00.630
That part doesn't matter but
good question, Anwar.

65
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.599
And anybody watching this in their
screen doesn't quite look like this.

66
00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.641
Dissolution may change up their UI.

67
00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:10.533
I don't know they could be
running AB test for all I know.

68
00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:11.346
But don't worry about that.

69
00:04:11.346 --> 00:04:15.116
Just listen to kind of the baseline of
what we're saying and just follow along.

70
00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:19.824
Cuz again, DigitalOcean they have
a nice UI, it's nice and shiny.

71
00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:21.843
What we wanna choose is
we wanna choose Ubuntu,

72
00:04:21.843 --> 00:04:23.714
which is going to be
the default one chosen.

73
00:04:23.714 --> 00:04:28.021
And we wanna make sure we're on the LTS
version and not the one above and

74
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:32.474
not the one below, because the commands
will work slightly differently

75
00:04:32.474 --> 00:04:34.738
depending on the version of Ubuntu.
