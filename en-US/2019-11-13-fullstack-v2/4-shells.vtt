00:00:00.725 --> 00:00:04.070
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
now we'll talk about shells.

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.647
What is a shell?

3
00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:07.339
I'll give you a hint.

4
00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.960
You just used one five seconds ago.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.200
Yes.

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Bash.

7
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.920
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

8
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is the one that's included
with a lot of Unix systems by default, but

9
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.390
it basically allows you
to run command lines.

10
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.320
And run a lot of the basic systems
that that come along with Unix.

11
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.910
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exactly right, good answer.

12
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.090
The shell is just a command interpreter
to interface with a system.

13
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.440
Like I said, in the old days, the 80s,
[LAUGH] I'm dating myself now.

14
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.450
Not that long ago, that's all you had.

15
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.480
You just had this blinking cursor
when you sat down on a computer and

16
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.670
is really intimidating and
people are, what do I do?

17
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.585
There's no easy way to figure
out which commands you can run.

18
00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:53.159
Heck, you probably didn't even know which
operating system you're on if you just sat

19
00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.960
down on a random computer.

20
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.052
But shells are just a way
of talking to the OS,

21
00:00:57.052 --> 00:01:00.350
to talk to the other applications
talking to the system.

22
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.930
The terminal is the application
that we're in here.

23
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.610
So I'm running iTerm which
it's pretty popular.

24
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.890
Some of you are probably
running something different.

25
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.060
If you're using Windows, you're probably
using PowerShell or something like that.

26
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.550
But Terminal it's just a wrapper
on shell applications.

27
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.630
And some of the more popular
shell applications are Bash,

28
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.340
that's what we're using today.

29
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.570
Probably, we'll check in a second.

30
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.350
ZSH is a really popular one.

31
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.540
There's more, I won't go into all of
them because they're not relevant.

32
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.870
But Bash is the primary one that
you're probably gonna see most often.

33
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.304
And it's on every operating
system that you need.

34
00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:45.499
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And, like I've said before,

35
00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:49.130
the shell is just that
frontline that's the interface.

36
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.900
It is a user interface of sorts, and
it just talks to an application or the OS,

37
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.237
which talks to the kernel.

38
00:01:54.237 --> 00:01:56.960
And the kernel is the core
of the operating system.

39
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.550
That's the thing that does all the work,
it talks to the actual machine layer.

40
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.530
So the great thing about using the shell
is we're not that far removed from

41
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.290
the actual code that's running underneath.

42
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.250
Versus a GUI which is
a few more steps removed.

43
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.650
Because that's usually gonna talk
to the shell in some sort or

44
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.680
run commands in that way.

45
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.720
If you wanna show the shell that
you're in, you can type, echo $0.

46
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.800
So let's try that now, echo,
which echo just repeats what I'm saying.

47
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.270
I want it to say $0, $ is just an
expansion and that expands the 0 variable.

48
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.220
And it says we're in bash.

49
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.040
If you're not in Bash,
you should let me know.

50
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.965
You're probably in Bash though, unless
someone told you to download something,

51
00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:38.768
you should use the SH.

52
00:02:38.768 --> 00:02:40.303
It's way cooler, which,

53
00:02:40.303 --> 00:02:44.596
again, I'm not gonna get into that
debate today about which one is better.

54
00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:46.190
But we'll use Bash because
it's standardized.
