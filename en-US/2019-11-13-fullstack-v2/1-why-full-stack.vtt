00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.053
&gt;&gt; Jem: And why full stack?

2
00:00:02.053 --> 00:00:05.668
I know, I'm really harping on what is
full stack, and going on this definition.

3
00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:09.156
Because again,
if you say you're a full stack engineer,

4
00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:12.655
there are people that are like,
that's not a real thing.

5
00:00:12.655 --> 00:00:17.695
And when I hear full stack, or
I get a lot of recruiters reach out and

6
00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:20.850
say, hey, I need a full stack engineer.

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.236
What I think is they want a hacker,
[LAUGH] but

8
00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:25.050
they don't know what they need.

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.974
So they say, I want someone who's good at
everything because we'll figure out what

10
00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:30.252
you need when you get here.

11
00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:33.627
That's okay too if that's
kind of where you wanna go.

12
00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:35.132
I started doing full stack.

13
00:00:35.132 --> 00:00:39.553
I started working in PHP, which PHP
you can consider one of the universal

14
00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:44.062
languages that you can code in
the backend, you can code in the frontend.

15
00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:45.276
It's actually not a bad language.

16
00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:49.769
It gets a lot of flack,
but underrated I think.

17
00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.727
But you went full stack because
at some point in your career,

18
00:00:52.727 --> 00:00:54.530
you're gonna see all these things.

19
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.490
All the concepts we come over today,
if you're gonna be an engineer for 10, 15,

20
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.357
20, however long you wanna be an engineer,
you're gonna see all these things.

21
00:01:02.357 --> 00:01:03.798
And I want you to be familiar with them.

22
00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:05.162
And that's really what it's about.

23
00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:08.949
And honestly, I'll tell you now,
and it's just between us and

24
00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:13.241
some random strangers on the Internet,
there's a lot of UI engineers.

25
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:16.272
UI engineering is probably one
of the easy fields to get into,

26
00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:19.207
because you can just open up browser and
just start coding.

27
00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:20.067
And that's good.

28
00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:21.931
Everybody should think like an engineer.

29
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:23.547
Well, not everybody, but

30
00:01:23.547 --> 00:01:28.264
everybody should understand how the world
works, how this technology works.

31
00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:31.846
But if you wanna differentiate yourself,
understanding full stack,

32
00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:35.796
understanding how it all comes together,
will make you the better engineer.

33
00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:40.391
Amongst all the UI engineers in the world,
even if you don't do any of the stuff ever

34
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:43.226
again, just knowing makes
you a better engineer.

35
00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:44.405
That much I can say that.

36
00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:47.881
And that's why I like to do this course,
because it's just so helpful.

37
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:50.964
It's been so helpful in my career because
you never know what you have to do.

38
00:01:50.964 --> 00:01:54.775
In fact,
&gt;&gt; Jem: At Netflix I used to,

39
00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:57.207
well, I still do, but
I used to be an IC, so

40
00:01:57.207 --> 00:02:00.403
that's individual contributor
on the frontend team.

41
00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:02.055
I worked on the non-member side.

42
00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:05.414
So if you go to netflix.com or
on the TV, any of that stuff,

43
00:02:05.414 --> 00:02:07.241
that's the domain I worked in.

44
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:11.329
So if you're not logged in,
that's my team.

45
00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.320
But what I did was I
built a lot of A/B tests.

46
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.075
So we test things constantly.

47
00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:18.049
But now I moved away from that.

48
00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.168
Now I work on one of our core teams.

49
00:02:21.168 --> 00:02:23.825
So that sits between the UI section.

50
00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:27.620
And it sits between kind
of the platform layer.

51
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.479
I work in between there.

52
00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:30.093
So primarily on Node, things like that.

53
00:02:32.156 --> 00:02:35.795
&gt;&gt; Jem: I've spent all of last week
doing a [LAUGH] database migration,

54
00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:39.791
because I chose Redis to build
a service and I'm now moving to MySQL.

55
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:40.775
And I've had to hook these all up.

56
00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:42.992
I had a problem with the load balancer.

57
00:02:42.992 --> 00:02:45.342
Some of the security
permissions were incorrect.

58
00:02:45.342 --> 00:02:47.509
I had to fix the caching.

59
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.266
Let me just say,
I won't go into details, but

60
00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:52.485
I had to do a lot of things that required
me to understand exactly what's happening.

61
00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:56.940
And if I said, I'm just the UI engineer,
that's I'll know what to do,

62
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.998
I would not have gotten very far.

63
00:02:58.998 --> 00:03:01.054
So again, being a full stack engineer and

64
00:03:01.054 --> 00:03:03.767
understanding these things
is incredibly valuable.

65
00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:07.291
And I'm not just saying that because
you're sitting there watching this course,

66
00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:09.219
I'm saying it because
I truly believe that.
