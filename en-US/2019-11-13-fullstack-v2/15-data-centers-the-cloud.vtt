1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.671
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But, generally, there's
gonna be stacks and stacks of servers.

2
00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:07.097
So, if you want to picture your laptop or
your desktop or your computer as a server,

3
00:00:07.097 --> 00:00:10.957
or even a cell phone as a server,
you're gonna have stacks and stacks and

4
00:00:10.957 --> 00:00:15.351
stacks of these all networked together so
they can handle requests efficiently.

5
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:17.774
And servers are particularly built.

6
00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:19.566
If you pay money for a server,

7
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:23.810
they're built particular ways that
consumer grade hardware is not.

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.654
For instance, they're gonna have
probably error correcting memory.

9
00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:30.392
They're going to have faster CPUs
than generally are available.

10
00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:35.487
They'll have like 40 or 50 core CPUs
which, for most people, would be complete

11
00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:40.320
overkill because modern software doesn't
take advantage of that many cores.

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.049
It's multi threading is hard,
totally different course.

13
00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:46.215
Is there a course on multi threading?

14
00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:47.068
I'm not gonna teach that.

15
00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:50.340
[LAUGH] That's gonna be way too hard.

16
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.222
But servers are built for these things,
and when you run an application on

17
00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:58.040
a server, it automatically can fork
processes, it can fork commands,

18
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.435
it can handle requests in one thread and
spin off to another one.

19
00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:05.673
But servers, essentially,
are custom built machines specifically for

20
00:01:05.673 --> 00:01:09.444
disturbing files and
not necessarily interacting with as much.

21
00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:14.258
Servers generally live in
a place called data centers.

22
00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:17.188
Data centers are these racks and
racks and racks and

23
00:01:17.188 --> 00:01:22.028
racks and racks and racks machines usually
run really, really cold environments,

24
00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:25.452
just because computers run hot,
servers like to run cold.

25
00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.049
They're usually clean,
so not a lot of dust.

26
00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.978
Imagine if you have, I don't know,
what is this like, 10,000 fans running?

27
00:01:32.978 --> 00:01:35.920
[LAUGH] And a little bit of dust gets
in there, it's gonna ruin your day.

28
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.363
So they're generally pretty clean.

29
00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.391
Security on them is very tight.

30
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.623
Think of a bank, and then triple that, and

31
00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:44.049
that's what securities
on data centers are.

32
00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.867
Because this is information, this is
power, this is what the Internet runs on.

33
00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:53.565
For instance,
a couple of years ago AWS went down.

34
00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:57.108
So that's Amazon Web Server, that's
one of the biggest hosts in the world.

35
00:01:57.108 --> 00:02:00.187
It's what Netflix uses,
what a lot of people use.

36
00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:03.258
One of them went down and
the Internet went down essentially.

37
00:02:03.258 --> 00:02:08.014
So we think of the Internet as these
distributed computers all around

38
00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:12.196
the world, but we really are relying
on main data centers and

39
00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:15.232
different routing networks, backbones.

40
00:02:15.232 --> 00:02:19.077
There's like core parts of
the infrastructure that if they go down,

41
00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:20.085
we're all sunk.

42
00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:24.472
But I think the most notable thing that
I find interesting about data centers is

43
00:02:24.472 --> 00:02:28.209
the amount of power they consume
is massive, city scale massive.

44
00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.512
It doesn't look like this, but
if you have all these millions and

45
00:02:31.512 --> 00:02:34.776
millions of cores running,
they're sucking up a lot of power.

46
00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:38.867
And what you'll see now is Facebook,
they've built their own data centers.

47
00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:39.896
Google has their own data centers.

48
00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:41.601
Amazon has their own data centers.

49
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:45.488
And they're all specialized machines
specifically built for their applications.

50
00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:47.408
But what a lot of them are doing,
which is good,

51
00:02:47.408 --> 00:02:50.816
is they're building this renewable energy
and they're building next wind farms or

52
00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:52.978
something like that because these eat so
much power.

53
00:02:52.978 --> 00:02:55.876
That's totally a tangent on data centers.

54
00:02:55.876 --> 00:03:00.161
But, generally, when you have requests,
it's going to hit a data center somewhere.

55
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.057
Some people like to host their own.

56
00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.634
We'll talk a bit more about
the cloud in a second.

57
00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:06.675
But will identify what it looks like.

58
00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:09.515
This is the free open source image.

59
00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:11.232
The ones from Google
are like very impressive.

60
00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:14.385
They're much larger buildings.

61
00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:17.207
So a data center is just this
collection of computers.

62
00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:20.917
Often, they're shared between different
applications, different companies.

63
00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:27.553
A lot of times you can rent one server or
a fraction of a server with the VPS.

64
00:03:27.553 --> 00:03:30.448
Or sometimes you can own an entire data
center if you're a big enough company.

65
00:03:32.988 --> 00:03:34.312
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
let's talk about the cloud.

66
00:03:34.312 --> 00:03:38.381
Data centers are newer
thinking about computers and

67
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:45.516
data centers are actually fairly modern
invention, I say fairly, say 15, 20 years.

68
00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:49.716
Before if I wanted to run a website or
host anything, I had a rack of computers

69
00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:53.263
sitting here and literally if
someone says the server's down,

70
00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:55.249
I had to go plug it back in like that.

71
00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:57.053
That was the way servers used to work.

72
00:03:57.053 --> 00:04:00.729
Then people said, yeah,
that's a hassle, servers are expensive,

73
00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.490
the hardware can get out of date.

74
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.638
How do you take a server down
without taking everything down?

75
00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:08.840
So we have the single data center so
someone else can answer someone

76
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.091
else's problem at this point, people that
are specialized in working with hardware.

77
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.288
And the great thing about
cloud computing and

78
00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:20.585
data centers is they can be in
different parts of the planet.

79
00:04:20.585 --> 00:04:24.490
So if I were hosting this video right now,
this course on my laptop,

80
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.475
the minute I go to lunch or
close my computer, everything goes down.

81
00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:29.580
That's not good.

82
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.316
And also, if you're in say, Greenland,
yeah, if you're in like, say,

83
00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:37.433
Greenland, I don't think
it's massive scale.

84
00:04:37.433 --> 00:04:40.940
I'm starting to question this logo now,
but

85
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.269
let's say you're in London about there.

86
00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:46.253
It's gonna take a lot of
hops to get over here.

87
00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:49.075
So why not have a data center in,
I don't know,

88
00:04:49.075 --> 00:04:51.771
Africa which is gonna
be a little bit closer.

89
00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:53.654
You don't have to make
the hop across the Atlantic.

90
00:04:53.654 --> 00:04:55.465
It's gonna be a little bit faster.

91
00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:57.391
And that's the advantage of the cloud,

92
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:01.196
is that I can have the same application
running in different parts of the world.

93
00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:03.327
And it's gonna be a little bit faster and

94
00:05:03.327 --> 00:05:06.597
you're gonna reduce that lag
if you're a little bit closer.

95
00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:09.596
Remember how we ran trace route
earlier and it did all those hops.

96
00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:13.376
You generally want the least number of
hops because every hop is the chance for

97
00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:17.625
something to go wrong or it's just slower
because there's still nanoseconds it takes

98
00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:21.428
for a switch to intercept a request and
switch to the next one and the next one.

99
00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:28.515
But the great thing about the cloud
is this idea of elastic computing.

100
00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:29.547
What is elastic computing?

101
00:05:29.547 --> 00:05:33.030
It's kind of what it sounds like but,
and you probably hear the phrase a lot,

102
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.274
what do you all think it is?

103
00:05:37.534 --> 00:05:38.539
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Anybody?

104
00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.463
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it scaling,
like as needed or-

105
00:05:40.463 --> 00:05:42.600
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, exactly right, Sam.

106
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.157
Yeah, exactly.

107
00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:46.067
It's what it sounds like.

108
00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:47.996
It's, it's elastic.

109
00:05:47.996 --> 00:05:49.573
What's great about that is and

110
00:05:49.573 --> 00:05:53.282
why data centers are great in the cloud
is great is I am I am Mark Urbanski.

111
00:05:53.282 --> 00:05:56.755
I am big,
powerful CEO Frontend Masters.com,

112
00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:59.223
and I'm getting a lot of traffic.

113
00:05:59.223 --> 00:06:00.291
It's scaling scaling.

114
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.821
In the old days, what I had to do
was I had to buy more servers and

115
00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:03.913
I had to buy more servers.

116
00:06:03.913 --> 00:06:07.239
But if you have a data center we can
rent out, we can just say like, hey,

117
00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:09.084
I need to allocate three more servers.

118
00:06:09.084 --> 00:06:10.267
All right, cool.

119
00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:11.143
Hit a button.

120
00:06:11.143 --> 00:06:12.162
Done.

121
00:06:12.162 --> 00:06:15.502
I need to scale down because it's
Christmas time and people don't study.

122
00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:17.655
They don't do Frontend Masters
over Christmas or something.

123
00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:19.069
We can just scale that back down.

124
00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.495
So our costs can adjust with the traffic
rather than us being fixed with a certain

125
00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:27.740
set of hardware that we're paying for,
maintaining and things like that.

126
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.313
You hear the phrase a lot elastic cloud
computing that's what that's referring to.

127
00:06:31.313 --> 00:06:34.478
For instance, real life example, Netflix,

128
00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:37.571
one of our busiest times
a year is Christmas.

129
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:40.289
People are home to families and you
know what people do with their families,

130
00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.485
they don't want to talk to them.

131
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:42.130
They don't hang out.

132
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.168
So they're all watching Netflix in
their room on their phones doing what

133
00:06:46.168 --> 00:06:46.969
families do.

134
00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:50.413
So, it's one of our busiest
times of the year, so

135
00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:53.620
what we do is we can set
the limits much higher.

136
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.874
We just scale up our servers.

137
00:06:54.874 --> 00:06:57.498
So we just scale up all our servers
to handle this additional traffic.

138
00:06:57.498 --> 00:07:00.475
And then once traffic starts to ramp down,
we just scale this back down.

139
00:07:00.475 --> 00:07:03.824
So we're not paying for this unused
compute cycles that we don't need.

140
00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:07.999
That's really powerful and that's a really
new idea in the world of computing.

141
00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:13.006
It's just like this on
demand capacity as we need.

142
00:07:13.006 --> 00:07:16.836
But, honestly, most of you,
and most people watching this,

143
00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:20.099
you're never gonna need
a data center with a server.

144
00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:24.432
If you do, nice job, you are killing it.

145
00:07:24.432 --> 00:07:28.484
You're doing really great if you need
an entire data center, but most people,

146
00:07:28.484 --> 00:07:31.036
we just need a tiny little
fraction of one server.

147
00:07:31.036 --> 00:07:34.735
Because remember how I said
servers have 50, 60 hundred cores,

148
00:07:34.735 --> 00:07:38.179
actually don't know what the limit is,
probably pretty high,

149
00:07:38.179 --> 00:07:41.331
probably in the thousands for
you at the supercomputers.

150
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:41.934
Anybody know?

151
00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:43.688
It's not important.

152
00:07:43.688 --> 00:07:48.180
But what we need is we just probably need
a fraction of a fraction of a server.

153
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.220
And the server we're gonna create today
is gonna be one core on one server,

154
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.890
which is just like a fraction of
a fraction of a fraction of a server.

155
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.799
Because that's all we need, and
why pay for things we don't need?

156
00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:03.109
And that's the idea behind cloud
computing in this capacity,

157
00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:05.232
you just pay for what you need.

158
00:08:05.232 --> 00:08:09.639
So what we do is we take a server,
we just slice it into little chunks and

159
00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:12.200
these chunks can't talk to each other.

160
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.839
There's this idea of process isolation,

161
00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:19.887
which is you're running
I like to party.com.

162
00:08:19.887 --> 00:08:21.658
