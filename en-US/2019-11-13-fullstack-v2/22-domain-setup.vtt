00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.736
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
let's set up that domain, we bought it.

2
00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:07.062
But right now if you go there it points
to like a holding page or a blank page or

3
00:00:07.062 --> 00:00:11.337
it doesn't resolve anything depending
on who your hosting provider is.

4
00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:14.624
But what we want to do is we want to
point the domain to the new server.

5
00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:16.476
And this is where it gets tricky.

6
00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:19.986
Kidding, it's not that tricky, but
it's going to involve these records and

7
00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:23.194
if I said, modify your a record to
do this, t wouldn't make any sense.

8
00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:28.206
But now it does because you're
all up here now at DNS Records.

9
00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:33.538
So what we want to do is we want to
add two A records to our domain.

10
00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:35.394
We want to use the @,
which is the root domain.

11
00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:40.271
So for
instance jemisthe.best is my root domain.

12
00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:44.883
Which is actually different
from www.jemisthebest.

13
00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:50.439
Man that was a good domain name I'm glad,
I like to say that all the time.

14
00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:55.241
What we wanna do it to make it easier,
we can use GoDaddy or

15
00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:59.756
Google domains or
name cheap to modify the A records.

16
00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:03.186
But what I'd rather do, and
I think it's a little bit easier,

17
00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:07.137
we can use Digital Ocean and
use their name servers, because honestly,

18
00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:08.850
their UI is just easier to use.

19
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.718
So the first thing we want to do is we
want to modify our name servers from

20
00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:15.680
Digital Ocean on whatever
hosting provider we have.

21
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.337
So I'm going to walk through that it's
going to look a little different depending

22
00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:20.453
on who owns your domain.

23
00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:23.505
But generally the steps
are always going to be the same.

24
00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:27.747
So I'll go back to,
first I'll go with Digital Ocean.

25
00:01:27.747 --> 00:01:34.219
And let's see, I'm gonna go to manage and
I believe it's networking.

26
00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:45.323
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, so what I can do is I
can enter the domain that eventually I

27
00:01:45.323 --> 00:01:47.166
wanna create records for.

28
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:51.723
So I'm gonna say, jemisthe.best.

29
00:01:51.723 --> 00:01:58.790
And I'm gonna add that domain for now.

30
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.629
And then it gives you
the option up here to say Hey,

31
00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:06.302
I want to create a different record right
now we're just going to use the a record.

32
00:02:06.302 --> 00:02:13.000
Someone say at and I regret now not
naming my server something better.

33
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.154
I believe it's this one.

34
00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:18.369
And it's nice because Digital Ocean
keeps track of your droplets and

35
00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.595
your IP addresses so it'll
automatically populate whichever one.

36
00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:28.273
Whichever IP address you wanna point
it to based on the drop that you have.

37
00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:33.562
So we can create one record for
that, and then I want another one for

38
00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:38.570
WWW, which is different from
just the canonical root domain,

39
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.176
and then I wanna direct
to the same droplets.

40
00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:43.796
And then I'm going to create a new record.

41
00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:50.104
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So at this point,

42
00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:54.155
your DNS records location should
look something like this.

43
00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:58.411
And the a record that says hey DNS
record is hear that a record says,

44
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:02.440
DNS record says here and
then we have these name servers Again,

45
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.027
name servers are they hold the address
book, they hold the phone book.

46
00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:10.274
But right now,
if you go to whatever domain you bought,

47
00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:13.120
it's not going to redirect
to your website yet.

48
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.395
That's because one,
your server is not really up and running.

49
00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:20.221
It's running but it's not really accepting
connections to the name servers wrong So

50
00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:24.241
what we need to do is change the name
server to give control to the hosting

51
00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:29.220
provider to say, hey, actually I want to
use Digital Ocean, same server, not yours.

52
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.333
So I'm gonna copy this name.

53
00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:37.547
And using whatever your hosting
provider is, I'm using name cheap.

54
00:03:37.547 --> 00:03:41.605
I'm gonna go to Domain.

55
00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:42.781
And this is under configuration.

56
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:45.525
It's gonna look a little bit different
depending on who your host is.

57
00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.279
But the principle will be the same.

58
00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:51.504
If you have questions you can
just google GoDaddy or whatever,

59
00:03:51.504 --> 00:03:53.187
change the name server.

60
00:03:53.187 --> 00:03:58.027
Okay, so whatever your hosting provider is
just find where to change the name server.

61
00:03:58.027 --> 00:04:01.042
For Namecheap it's under advanced DNS.

62
00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:04.305
And we'll go to Custom Nameservers.

63
00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:05.731
Actually, no.

64
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:07.637
We wanna go to not Find Nameservers.

65
00:04:07.637 --> 00:04:08.955
We wanna go to Add Nameserver.

66
00:04:11.682 --> 00:04:14.817
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Actually,
that isn't correct, too.

67
00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:18.587
I did this before and it always stress
me out because the way it's named.

68
00:04:18.587 --> 00:04:20.684
It's on domain.

69
00:04:20.684 --> 00:04:24.388
All right, I forgot it's under domain and
there's also name servers

70
00:04:24.388 --> 00:04:27.674
under Advanced DNS, but
that's something we wanna go with.

71
00:04:27.674 --> 00:04:31.856
We wanna go with custom DNS.

72
00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:35.708
And I'm just gonna paste in
the Digital Ocean name server.

73
00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.431
Remember, I grabbed that from here.

74
00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:43.699
It's usually ns one and ns two and
ns three for almost all hosting providers.

75
00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.730
And going to paste on this.

76
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.866
Going to move the dot i don't know
when you copy use the copy command

77
00:04:49.866 --> 00:04:51.103
Digital Ocean does that.

78
00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:54.664
I don't think it matters but
I like to remove it anyways.

79
00:04:54.664 --> 00:04:58.526
And I'm just going to
give name server three.

80
00:04:58.526 --> 00:04:59.402
Dots.

81
00:04:59.402 --> 00:05:02.159
Then I'm gonna hit this check mark save.

82
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:09.980
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: What I'm doing, so what I we
just did was we move the canonical record.

83
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.505
The record of, if I go to jem is the best.

84
00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:16.769
I moved who owns that record
to Digital Ocean now.

85
00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:17.589
So now.

86
00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:21.942
They're going to be once the route
30 means once control it might

87
00:05:21.942 --> 00:05:24.048
take 48 hours to take effect.

88
00:05:24.048 --> 00:05:27.840
It might take 30, 20, 30 minutes to update
again because they're massive records and

89
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.904
they're shifting ownership
over the internet and

90
00:05:29.904 --> 00:05:32.658
there's servers now to coordinate and
all these things like that.

91
00:05:32.658 --> 00:05:35.919
So give it some time it will probably take
by the time we finished our server setup,

92
00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:36.930
it should be ready to go.

93
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.676
But it won't be ready immediately,

94
00:05:38.676 --> 00:05:42.466
because these things take time to expire
then renew and all that type of things.

95
00:05:42.466 --> 00:05:43.488
Any questions so far?

96
00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:44.360
Everybody with me?

97
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.933
I know that was a little tedious, but

98
00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:52.502
we're doing that nitty gritty of how do
you actually point a domain to a server.
