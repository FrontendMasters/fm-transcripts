00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:04.411
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: How does the Internet work?

2
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:07.405
Someone take a stab at it, not Sam.

3
00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:10.545
Anybody else?

4
00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:11.872
Throw out an answer.

5
00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:13.623
This is one of my favorite
interview questions.

6
00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:18.488
I don't ask it that often, but
it's one of those, what do you understand?

7
00:00:18.488 --> 00:00:21.602
Where's your knowledge lies,
at the front end, is it the back end,

8
00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:23.280
is it networking, is it somewhere?

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.860
If you're an engineer,
your understanding lies somewhere.

10
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.606
Unless you're like, I don't know,
a self-driving car engineer or

11
00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:34.128
a bridge building engineer, okay, there's
lots of different types of engineer.

12
00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:37.213
But if you're a software
engineer that works on the web,

13
00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:41.467
which is most software engineers, you
should know at least some part of this.

14
00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:42.971
So how does the Internet work?

15
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:44.226
Anybody?
Just throw out anything.

16
00:00:44.226 --> 00:00:45.172
There are no wrong answers.

17
00:00:45.172 --> 00:00:48.404
We're all learning here today.

18
00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:49.963
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A bunch of
computers talking to each other.

19
00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:51.147
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Good enough for me.

20
00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:53.520
Yeah, it's a bunch of computers
talking to each other.

21
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.782
So how does the Internet work, though?

22
00:00:55.782 --> 00:00:58.131
That's kinda what the Internet is.

23
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:00.926
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Lots of requests and
responses, right?

24
00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:02.527
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:09.977
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, lots of requests and
responses, that's good for me, too.

26
00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:12.577
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just
know there's files and

27
00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:18.090
packets of files get passed
across different, I don't know.

28
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.748
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, sometimes it's files,
packets, computers.

29
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.969
I think a lot of what we think of the
Internet is we think of web browsers, and

30
00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.324
we think of, I don't know, maybe
streaming movies or something like that.

31
00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:34.777
Mostly what people interact with
the Internet is the World Wide Web,

32
00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:36.864
that's the www dot something.

33
00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:38.476
We all know that, but

34
00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:42.966
I guarantee my future son will
not know what www stands for.

35
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.669
It's just that when you type in,
but that's the World Wide Web,

36
00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:47.204
that's just a part of the Internet.

37
00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:50.941
There's still FTP,
there's things that run over the Internet,

38
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:54.225
so there's things like a BitTorrent or
movie streaming.

39
00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:59.400
There's lots of other examples,
but most people, yes, Mark.

40
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.488
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Andrew Online
says it's a series of tubes.

41
00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That was the answer I was

42
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.916
actually looking for.

43
00:02:05.916 --> 00:02:07.381
They would be hired in a second.

44
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.667
It is a series of tubes.

45
00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:11.232
But like every site,
it's a series of requests and

46
00:02:11.232 --> 00:02:14.287
responses by different devices
just talking to each other.

47
00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:17.825
So I use the simplest definition
I could think of, and

48
00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:21.139
I didn't look this up,
even though I could have.

49
00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.566
I just said it's a series of
globally interconnected devices.

50
00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:30.057
And I'll say it's a series of
publicly interconnected devices.

51
00:02:30.057 --> 00:02:32.116
That's the Internet,
that's the thing we all know,

52
00:02:32.116 --> 00:02:33.652
it's the thing we're using right now.

53
00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:36.906
Thing that is running through and
streaming to you at home,

54
00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.152
you in the classroom.

55
00:02:38.152 --> 00:02:41.142
That's a little different
from the intranet.

56
00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:43.863
The intranet is like the Internet,
but it's private.

57
00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:48.971
How many people use a VPN,
a Virtual Private Network, for work?

58
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:49.833
Yeah, most companies do.

59
00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.034
It's one of the best practices.

60
00:02:51.034 --> 00:02:53.835
So if you're on a VPN,
you're on an intranet.

61
00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:57.027
Which is just a private Internet of
different servers talking to each other,

62
00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:58.806
but it's inaccessible from the outside.

63
00:02:58.806 --> 00:03:00.247
Why is that important?

64
00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.610
At some point,
you may hear the term intranets,

65
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.886
you may hear the term WAN wide
area network, pretty similar.

66
00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:11.133
Local area network would be
Internet just for this classroom.

67
00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:13.979
So if I had a server running, actually
there are server's running over there,

68
00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.414
there's a server running over there,
and it was only accessible.

69
00:03:16.414 --> 00:03:18.640
That would be a local area network,
that is not accessible from the outside.
