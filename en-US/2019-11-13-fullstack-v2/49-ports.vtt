00:00:00.702 --> 00:00:02.983
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I keep saying ports and
I should have defined that earlier.

2
00:00:02.983 --> 00:00:08.172
It's a communication endpoint that maps
to a specific process or network service.

3
00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:12.610
Now what, so why ports?

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.597
In terms of think about an operating
system level, why would I need a port for

5
00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:17.292
something?

6
00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:20.774
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

7
00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:23.773
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's like changing
the channel on your TV.

8
00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:27.399
It lets you dial in a specific
mode of communication.

9
00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.014
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

10
00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:33.059
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And let you keep your peanut
butter separate from your chocolate.

11
00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.587
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Peanut butter and chocolate?

12
00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:36.412
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's an old Reese's
peanut butter cup commercial.

13
00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.502
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But yeah,
the point is to be able to be specific,

14
00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:48.031
to talk to one program that's talking to
you, FTP versus HTTP versus whatever.

15
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.223
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exactly, on a computer,
I can hit an IP address,

16
00:00:51.223 --> 00:00:52.748
and it's like, cool.

17
00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:53.710
Where do I go now?

18
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.175
But by specifying the port,

19
00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:58.053
I can say exactly where I want
this communication to go.

20
00:00:58.053 --> 00:01:02.200
This is much more efficient than having
a trillion IP addresses where every single

21
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.013
IP address is a different service.

22
00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:07.324
We can hit one IP address and
have different ports.

23
00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:12.087
The dangerous thing about ports, is that,
every port that is open to the Internet

24
00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:16.181
means it's a vulnerability,
potentially, that can be exploited.

25
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:19.369
So in general, you want the minimum
amount of ports that you need running.

26
00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.083
That's why by default,
ports are closed until you open them up.

27
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:28.077
And even now I don't want port 3000
open because I don't need that to be

28
00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:29.833
exposed to the Internet.

29
00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:33.811
So if I went to, and
I demonstrated this earlier.

30
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:40.287
That means I can go to
jemisthebest on port 3000.

31
00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:42.479
And it still connects,
which is not what we want.

32
00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.601
We want only port 80 to connect, and
all traffic to go through port 80.

33
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:50.100
Because what if at some point I started
up another service on port 3000, and

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.722
I redirect somewhere else.

35
00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:55.729
I now have an open port that is vulnerable
to exploits or something like that.

36
00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.956
So in general, the best practice for
ports is always to keep them closed.

37
00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:03.663
Unless you need to open up, and only
open up the explicit ones that you need.

38
00:02:03.663 --> 00:02:07.069
Because again, it takes a trivial
amount of time to port scan you, and

39
00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.914
find out what software you're running and
what's open.

40
00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:15.342
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And if we wanna see
a different version of the ports that are,

41
00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:18.059
or we can see like what
the standard ports are.

42
00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.082
They're probably not gonna
be open most of the time.

43
00:02:20.082 --> 00:02:23.966
But you can say less /etc/ services.

44
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:27.178
And I find it really interesting,
cuz the other,

45
00:02:27.178 --> 00:02:31.016
a bit earlier we talked about
how there are standard ports.

46
00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:34.616
That's why we always choose something
above 2000 or 3000 or 1000.

47
00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:38.471
Because there are well-defined ports,
like 22.

48
00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.671
Let's see what's on here, FTP is port 21.

49
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:44.449
And these are just de facto standards,
you can change these at any time.

50
00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:49.368
But it's sometimes better
to keep these standards.

51
00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:52.312
The other day, Sam, you mentioned,

52
00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:56.823
you can change your port from 22 for
SSH if you wanted to.

53
00:02:56.823 --> 00:03:00.557
You could, but that makes SSHing it a
little bit more tricky if I want to, say,

54
00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:01.814
share my server with you.

55
00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:07.385
But you can absolutely do that, and
it would just change the port map.

56
00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:10.338
Is there any question about ports?

57
00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:12.882
The only thing you really need to know is
keep them closed unless you need them.

58
00:03:12.882 --> 00:03:16.989
[LAUGH] Then if you wanna give a too long,
didn't listen to Jem.

59
00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.666
So yeah, just keep them closed.
