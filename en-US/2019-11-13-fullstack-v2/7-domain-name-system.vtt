00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But I pinged twitter.com,
and I didn't ping an IP address.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.160
And the way that works is another set of
protocols, there's a lot of protocols.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.080
When you look at the Internet and
the people that run the Internet and

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.980
there are people that run the Internet or
run the switches and connections and

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.300
backbones.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.560
Again, it's this trust system and
one of those things is the DNS system.

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.570
DNS is run by I wanna say it's ICANN
Internet, I forgot what ICANN stands for.

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.260
It stands for something, don't worry,
but they control domain names.

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.540
When you buy domain name, you actually
pay a little bit of fee $0.60 or

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.290
maybe more maybe less to ICANN and
they help create this domain name system.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.240
And what it is is just,
it's an Internet phone book.

12
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.410
But that's oversimplifying it.

13
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.550
It's actually an intelligent
Internet phone book, just says hey,

14
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.130
I want to go to twitter.com.

15
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.390
It's not necessarily routing you
directly to the servers in San Francisco

16
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.230
because that would be really slow.

17
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.950
There's things called data
centers all around the world,

18
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.600
which is documented in a second.

19
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.180
But DNS says, what's the closest
server that this resolves to?

20
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.320
So all it does is it maps
domain names to IP addresses.

21
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.600
And we need them because I can't
remember my own IP address,

22
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.290
I can't remember anybody's IP address,
I can barely remember my own phone number.

23
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.940
The DNS system,

24
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.400
you've probably heard of it because again,
this is how the Internet works.

25
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.620
This is how it became accessible.

26
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.680
We're not all using shells and
using telnet and

27
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.200
all these command line tools to
download web pages, we're using GUIs.

28
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.550
Domain name system is just a way of making
the Internet accessible for more people.

29
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.470
And you probably all see or
not you probably,

30
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.567
I guarantee you've seen domains and domain
is something like frontendmasters.com,

31
00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.160
jemyoung.com, that's called your domain.

32
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.530
The dot com, dot biz,
dot net, dot anything,

33
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.880
that's the top level domain, it's the TLD.

34
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.180
TLDs are owned by specific companies,
entities or countries.

35
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.880
You know what my least favorite TLD is?

36
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.440
Dot biz.
You know, dot b-i-z.

37
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.990
It just seems like if I
see something dot biz,

38
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.610
no offense to anybody with a dot biz TLD,
it just seems like a scam.

39
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.880
If it's dot biz, it's like wow.

40
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.285
There's an [INAUDIBLE] that wants
to give money instead of dot biz.

41
00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:16.880
Wow, no, I'm kidding.

42
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.126
I'm really not, don't use dot biz.

43
00:02:19.126 --> 00:02:22.460
And over the years,
if you haven't noticed,

44
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.089
all the good dot coms are taken,
which is not necessarily true.

45
00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:29.124
You just have to get really,
really creative.

46
00:02:29.124 --> 00:02:31.906
Remember that phase a couple
of years ago with the dot lys?

47
00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:38.193
It was like bitly, fastly, that was
like the hot new thing, like the dot li.

48
00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:41.470
I want to say dot lyzone
by some country somewhere.

49
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.850
I don't remember, you can look it up.

50
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.100
There's dot io, which is really expensive.

51
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.700
I wanna say it's Micronesia
that owns that country, but

52
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.430
almost every country has
their own top level domain.

53
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.898
So you can say, again, dmx.ru,

54
00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:58.692
dmx is the Google of Russia,
dot ru is Russia, cn is China.

55
00:02:58.692 --> 00:03:02.970
But largely dot com is still
kind of the domain that really

56
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.018
wants to have because it's the OG domains,
the first one, or one of the originals.

57
00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:10.399
There's also.dot net, there's dot org,
but generally dot orgs,

58
00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.951
it used to be you couldn't get one
without being like a nonprofit status or

59
00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:15.864
something like that, or university.

60
00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:19.679
But they since added dot edu,
which a lot of your colleges or

61
00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.850
universities, things
like that have a dot edu.

62
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.390
But now there's a whole bunch of top level
domains, because companies are like well,

63
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.840
how come I can't have my own TLD and
I CANNs like, okay,

64
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.610
we'll make some new ones for you.

65
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.698
So now there's dot Google there's dot dev,
there's dot party,

66
00:03:36.698 --> 00:03:38.640
my favorite domain name.

67
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.700
Just lots of top level domains, so

68
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.355
the good thing is if you need a website
today and you don't have one.

69
00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:46.792
You're gonna have one by the end of the
day but also you could use whatever TLD

70
00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:50.620
you want except for dot biz, I'm telling
you don't use dot biz, this is a bad idea.

71
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.200
A subdomain would be the blog or
tests or dev dot something.

72
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.433
That's what's known as a sub domain.

73
00:03:57.433 --> 00:03:59.650
And that just means it still
routes to the main domain, but

74
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.560
it's just probably
a different part of the site.

75
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.147
Now, can anybody tell me why I would
use a sub domain versus a path?

76
00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:10.932
And a path would be genuine com
slash about or about who am I or

77
00:04:10.932 --> 00:04:12.860
something like that.

78
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.960
Yes, Sam.

79
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you want to have
more than one actual separate server.

80
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.436
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, exactly, right.

81
00:04:20.436 --> 00:04:24.092
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It allows you to partition
your data more effectively prevents cross

82
00:04:24.092 --> 00:04:26.540
site scripting, stuff like that.

83
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.390
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
you're thinking at a really good level.

84
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.210
For users, the subdomain,
it just indicates,

85
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.740
it's a different site generally.

86
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.470
So blog.jemyoung.com looks completely
different from jemyoung.com.

87
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.887
And I'm not pimping my own website,
it's pretty poor, I don't maintain it,

88
00:04:41.887 --> 00:04:42.909
I think it's running.

89
00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.910
I don't even know if it's running
half the time because you know.

90
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's running but
your last post was five years ago.

91
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.345
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, don't judge me.

92
00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:49.850
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Don't judge me.

93
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.355
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

94
00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:51.025
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I thought this was

95
00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:52.450
a judgment free zone.

96
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.560
I thought hey, I'm going to become
internet famous and start doing a blog.

97
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.350
And then I ran out of steam really fast of
off that, I don't remember my last post is

98
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.470
on probably hashing or
something like that so important.

99
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.440
But it just tells the user that you're at
a completely different part of the site,

100
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.570
and its affiliated with the site, but it's
probably a different application entirely.

101
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.440
First the path, blog.jemyoung.com slash
about, which is yeah, you're part of

102
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.970
the site and you're just on a different
route, a different page on the main site.

103
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.699
And because of DNS system,
I can map jemyoung.com, the 23.23.185.61.

104
00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.944
So rather than remember that every
single time, I can just type that in and

105
00:05:31.944 --> 00:05:34.940
the DNS resolvers figure that out.

106
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.910
How do they figure that out?

107
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.370
More servers.

108
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.620
There are a lot of servers.

109
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.240
The Internet is built on servers and
trusts and nodes and things like that.

110
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.896
But there's idea called a name server.

111
00:05:45.896 --> 00:05:50.070
And the name server is the actual
entity that keeps that mapping.

112
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.868
So whenever you buy a new domain
from our web host, so name sheep or

113
00:05:53.868 --> 00:05:56.860
Go Daddy or Google and
one of the big ones.

114
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.840
They all have name servers.

115
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.760
And that just says hey,
this person just bought this domain.

116
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.270
And it's probably not going anywhere.

117
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.530
But if you need to look it up,
I know exactly where that is.

118
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.210
And actually, I'll talk about
that a second with packets.

119
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.440
But names are the thing that
we probably don't know exist.

120
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.860
We're going to modify one today just
because we're going to use it to point

121
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.820
from our hosts to our
server at some point.

122
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.290
But it's good to know
that name servers exists.

123
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.040
They essentially Are they the record
keepers of the internet if you're trying

124
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.850
to type them domain name
