00:00:00.185 --> 00:00:00.926
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I wanna talk about server.

2
00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:04.568
What does a server do?

3
00:00:04.568 --> 00:00:05.570
But give you a hint.

4
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.257
It's in the name.

5
00:00:06.257 --> 00:00:08.657
Not Sam.

6
00:00:08.657 --> 00:00:09.597
Anybody else?

7
00:00:09.597 --> 00:00:10.367
Yes.

8
00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:13.246
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, that's exactly right.

9
00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.606
It serves content.

10
00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:17.154
That is what a server does.

11
00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:22.584
Yes, I would answer it
a little bit differently.

12
00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:24.166
I'd say it responds to requests.

13
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.468
Yes, that's also what a server does.

14
00:00:26.468 --> 00:00:31.786
Though you can argue the definition
of responses is a form of content.

15
00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:34.895
But yours is probably a bit more
encompassing, which is good, but

16
00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:35.737
it serves files.

17
00:00:35.737 --> 00:00:38.488
Like that's usually what
you want a server to do.

18
00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:40.415
It serves something back.

19
00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:44.170
If a server just let's say I pinged it and
didn't do anything.

20
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.067
What's the point of the server?

21
00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:48.195
They're like, for all intents and
purposes, it doesn't exist to my needs.

22
00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:51.385
But a server is also just a really,
really powerful computer, or

23
00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.128
any computer at all can be a server.

24
00:00:53.128 --> 00:00:56.357
Your laptop can be a server.

25
00:00:56.357 --> 00:00:59.528
In fact, if you do any sort of
local development, it is a server.

26
00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:02.604
So when we think servers,
we often think giant server racks and

27
00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.240
data farms and all these things.

28
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.150
But my phone can be a server,
anything can be a server,

29
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.024
as long as it responds to a request and
serving content, it's a server.

30
00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:12.032
So let's make a server,

31
00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:14.631
because a server is what we're
gonna be doing today primarily.

32
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:16.799
Yeah, let's make a server.

33
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.403
So back to vim.

34
00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:20.821
So make sure you're in,

35
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:24.141
this is some temporary folder
we have write permissions.

36
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:26.768
If you can write last item,
switch folders, or create a new one.

37
00:01:26.768 --> 00:01:31.550
So just say vi simpleServer.js or
whatever you want to call it.

38
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.614
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
we're gonna write a bare bones HP server.

39
00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:50.146
I'm assuming you have Node installed,
if not MPM install dash.

40
00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:52.094
Actually just install Node, but

41
00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:55.929
99% of people have Node installed
in their computer already.

42
00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:56.941
You're in Frontend Masters.

43
00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:00.062
If not just google how to install Node and
do that real quick.

44
00:02:00.062 --> 00:02:03.833
Or if using Python we can
do it in Python as well.

45
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:06.633
Python is actually even
easier to start a server.

46
00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:08.444
It's like python dash m to start a server.

47
00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:09.664
But go ahead and fire that up.

48
00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:11.080
And I'm going to do the same thing.
