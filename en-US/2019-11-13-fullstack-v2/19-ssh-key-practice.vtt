WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:04.068
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So let's create an SSH key.

2
00:00:04.068 --> 00:00:08.319
What we wanna do is we wanna
cd into our .ssh directory.

3
00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.847
If you're on a Mac machine,
that's gonna be the default place for

4
00:00:11.847 --> 00:00:13.237
all of your SSH keys live.

5
00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:18.064
I want you to list out those files using
ls command just to see what's in there.

6
00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:24.044
And then we're gonna run ssh-keygen
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So I'll do that now.

7
00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:25.227
That's row one.

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.587
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
cd my home directory .ssh.

9
00:00:33.587 --> 00:00:35.358
Now I'm in here.

10
00:00:35.358 --> 00:00:39.500
List of my keys, they don't mean anything.

11
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.755
And then we're gonna run ssh-keygen.

12
00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:45.496
So let me just clear that, ssh-keygen.

13
00:00:45.496 --> 00:00:47.774
Pro tip and
what you will use all the time,

14
00:00:47.774 --> 00:00:51.811
if you tab it will try to autocomplete for
you, which is really, really,

15
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.914
really useful and I wanna run keygen.

16
00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:55.735
So I can say that, and I tab.

17
00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:00.260
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's gonna ask me what
I want to save the file name as.

18
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.739
If you have an SSH key called ID_rsan,

19
00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.642
which is the default name, use a different
name otherwise it will conflict.

20
00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:12.268
I'm gonna use full stack front end.

21
00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:13.878
I'm gonna use two,
you don't have to use two.

22
00:01:13.878 --> 00:01:16.197
I already have an original
full stack front end key,

23
00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:18.261
which I don't remember
which server goes to.

24
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:20.549
So I don't wanna delete it
cuz if I lose my ssh-key,

25
00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.013
I'm locked out of my own server.

26
00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:23.882
So I'll create a new one.

27
00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:25.401
You can use a passphrase if you want.

28
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:30.202
I won't for this case, but
you generally should if you're

29
00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:35.111
using ssh-key regularly, and
it's gonna leave it blank.

30
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:41.339
And it generated this
random key art image.

31
00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:43.288
All right, everybody have an SSH key?

32
00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:47.073
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No, I'm getting on no
such file or directory when I try to cd

33
00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:51.638
the into the-
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, not a problem.

34
00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:56.467
So what we can do is we can go to cd,
actually I'll just do,

35
00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:58.743
we can run make directory.

36
00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:04.613
So mkdir -/.ssh, actually,
I'm gonna run -p,

37
00:02:04.613 --> 00:02:10.880
p just means it will make it
if it doesn't already exist.

38
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.190
And you should have an SSH directory now.

39
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.696
So now if we clear, so
I'll do ls to list files.

40
00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:26.563
I'm gonna pipe the output using the pipe
operator, which is just this bar.

41
00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:30.982
And I'm going to grep, so
I'm gonna run a regular

42
00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:36.153
expression to try to find my key,
full stack front end 2.

43
00:02:36.153 --> 00:02:38.521
And you should have two
files if you do a search.

44
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:41.615
And of course, depending on what
you named your file, you grep for

45
00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:42.730
something different.

46
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.780
But here we have the private key.

47
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.748
So it doesn't end in .pub, and
then we have the public key.

48
00:02:48.748 --> 00:02:53.810
So I can show you that public key,
full stack front end 2.

49
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.868
Not that I'm worried about you
breaking into my server but

50
00:02:55.868 --> 00:02:57.884
you generally shouldn't show
people your private key.

51
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.133
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And It looks like
this long string of gibberish and

52
00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:06.953
that's just the key.

53
00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:10.775
So I can share this public key out
with anybody, I can email it to you.

54
00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:12.785
I'm gonna end up putting it on my server.

55
00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:14.122
But I can share it everywhere.

56
00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:18.112
And using this public key, I can
encrypt all the data I wanna send you.

57
00:03:18.112 --> 00:03:22.941
And I am the only one now using this
private key that can decrypt that data.

58
00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:26.759
It's a really amazing concept.

59
00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.331
Everybody have like some sort of output
looks like that, we all have keys,

60
00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:31.131
I'm assuming.

61
00:03:31.131 --> 00:03:33.637
Any questions on the commands I used?

62
00:03:33.637 --> 00:03:38.553
Cool, yeah, private key, public key.

63
00:03:38.553 --> 00:03:40.718
This is something that I like
honestly I don't know why but

64
00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:42.450
it took me a long time to
wrap my head around it.

65
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.922
Probably cuz it's not .private.

66
00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:46.416
I don't know why they didn't make
it .private and .pub, I'm like,

67
00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:47.384
which one is the right one?

68
00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:49.497
It's always gonna be a public key.

69
00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:51.978
Never gonna be a private key.

70
00:03:51.978 --> 00:03:53.560
And so now, we're gonna log in.

71
00:03:56.075 --> 00:03:58.169
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Actually before we do that,

72
00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.067
the whole point of this was adding
an SSH key to this Digital Ocean.

73
00:04:03.067 --> 00:04:05.252
So remember, we need that public key?

74
00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:07.398
So what we wanna do is you can use,

75
00:04:07.398 --> 00:04:11.780
depending on the operating system
you're on, you can say pd copy.

76
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.459
But I'm just gonna use my mouse here.

77
00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.269
Don't judge me.

78
00:04:16.532 --> 00:04:17.615
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I'm gonna paste that in.

79
00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:26.503
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I'll just call
it full stack front end p2 key.

80
00:04:26.503 --> 00:04:29.658
And if anytime you get hung up again,
that's why I love Digital Ocean.

81
00:04:29.658 --> 00:04:31.012
They have a really good community.

82
00:04:31.012 --> 00:04:35.574
They have entire instructions here about
how to save and copy your public and

83
00:04:35.574 --> 00:04:37.650
private key and things like that.

84
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.759
And they go into more detail and
all these other things.

85
00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.901
And we can just go ahead and
add that, cool.

86
00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:46.772
And make sure this one is checked.

87
00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:50.480
If you have additional keys that you
wanna use, as in they're already on your

88
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.432
computer, you don't wanna generate a new
one, you can just click those as well.

89
00:04:54.432 --> 00:04:55.939
But I'm just gonna use one for now.

90
00:04:58.717 --> 00:05:00.866
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And when we scroll down
to how many droplets we need, so

91
00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.702
droplets are just like
a fraction of a server.

92
00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:08.283
I can create two, three, four, whatever
I want, but I'm not gonna do that.

93
00:05:08.283 --> 00:05:12.878
I'm just gonna create one today,
cuz we don't wanna run up your bill.

94
00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:16.457
And the host name, honestly,
it doesn't matter.

95
00:05:16.457 --> 00:05:20.974
[LAUGH] There's an XKCD joke about naming
servers, that it's really hard because

96
00:05:20.974 --> 00:05:24.844
servers will live a very long time and
they're impossible to rename.

97
00:05:24.844 --> 00:05:26.750
Well, not impossible but
it's very difficult to rename.

98
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.684
So if you try to get clever and
like full stack front end,

99
00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:33.547
never gonna die server, I don't know.

100
00:05:33.547 --> 00:05:35.650
I don't know where I'm going
with my naming thing, but

101
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.324
naming things in computer science is hard.

102
00:05:37.324 --> 00:05:40.214
Just pick a random name,
it doesn't really matter.

103
00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:44.869
We have been, I can say at Netflix we've
been burned on our server names because

104
00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:48.982
we'll call it, I don't know,
we'll call it like EC web server one.

105
00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:52.464
And if we move to a different host, we're
no longer on EC2 instances from AWS, so

106
00:05:52.464 --> 00:05:54.134
the name doesn't make sense anymore.

107
00:05:54.134 --> 00:05:57.033
So five years later,
people are like what does this mean?

108
00:05:57.033 --> 00:05:59.749
And then nobody knows anymore
cuz the naming is lost.

109
00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:01.181
Naming is hard.

110
00:06:01.181 --> 00:06:03.847
Totally, totally a tangent there.

111
00:06:03.847 --> 00:06:05.038
But that's okay.

112
00:06:05.038 --> 00:06:06.360
And we can create a droplet.

113
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.034
We don't need backups because, well,
we're not doing anything that critical.

114
00:06:10.034 --> 00:06:13.164
But, in general,
you wanna back up your data all the time.

115
00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:16.197
Stuff goes wrong,
data centers have fires, hackers get in.

116
00:06:16.197 --> 00:06:17.934
You almost always wanna back up your data.

117
00:06:17.934 --> 00:06:19.374
But in this case, we'll be okay.

118
00:06:19.374 --> 00:06:21.034
I'm just gonna create that droplet.

119
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.717
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And it's building.

120
00:06:26.104 --> 00:06:27.644
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Did you enable backups?

121
00:06:27.644 --> 00:06:30.194
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No,
not unless you really want to but

122
00:06:30.194 --> 00:06:34.234
it'll just cost you more money for
no particular reason.

123
00:06:34.234 --> 00:06:35.391
And now it's building.

124
00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:44.011
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Cool,
we should be up and running now.

125
00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.325
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So I've been assigned
IP address to my server so

126
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:49.564
that I can connect to it.

127
00:06:49.564 --> 00:06:51.524
So I'm gonna hit copy.

128
00:06:51.524 --> 00:06:54.936
It's a nice little command there or
you can just highlight but

129
00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:57.045
it actually doesn't work that well.

130
00:06:57.045 --> 00:06:58.050
So copy that.
