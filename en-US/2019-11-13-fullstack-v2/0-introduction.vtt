00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.556
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We're doing Full Stack for
Front-End V2.

2
00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:05.083
It's been a couple of years since V1.

3
00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:08.509
And you're probably wondering,
what has changed on the server?

4
00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.544
Not much,
that's what's great about the server.

5
00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.031
The server won't let you down.

6
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:13.605
The server doesn't change.

7
00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:16.429
I have a server still
running from ten years ago.

8
00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.032
I update it, but that's it.

9
00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:20.076
I don't do anything else to it.

10
00:00:20.076 --> 00:00:22.651
I bet we can't say the same
thing about your front-end app.

11
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:23.724
Not true at all.

12
00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:27.205
I'm not bashing front-end, obviously,
cuz I do front-end as well.

13
00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:31.532
But I'm saying full stack,
it's where it's at.

14
00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:32.774
My name is Jem Young.

15
00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:34.822
I am a senior software
engineer at Netflix.

16
00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:38.166
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: My wife is the creative one.

17
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.736
So she edited this photo.

18
00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:43.878
That was my Halloween costume for
last year that I didn't get to wear.

19
00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:46.464
I'm hoping I get to wear it this year.

20
00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:49.012
We'll see, we'll see.

21
00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:52.638
One of the things I also do is I'm on
a podcast called Front End Happy Hour.

22
00:00:52.638 --> 00:00:54.559
We've been doing it several years now.

23
00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.093
I do it with, he was my manager,
now he's just another guy at Netflix.

24
00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.302
Still a manager,
I just have a different manager.

25
00:01:02.302 --> 00:01:07.263
And we have drinks and we talk about
front end stuff, and mainly this,

26
00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:11.143
but for shorter periods of time and
with more alcohol.

27
00:01:11.143 --> 00:01:12.741
So it's pretty entertaining.

28
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:17.649
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: If you wanna
see the slides today and

29
00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.625
kind of keep up,
it's at jemyoung.com/fsfe.

30
00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.303
That's full stack front-end.

31
00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:29.542
Last time I did front-end full stack and
it got really confusing, cuz even I mixed

32
00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:33.118
it up, but full stack front-end,
you should be at the right place.

33
00:01:33.118 --> 00:01:36.581
If the slides are not black,
you're on the old slides somehow.

34
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:38.349
I don't know how you got there.

35
00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:41.691
Today we're gonna cover a few parts.

36
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:45.732
And day one we're gonna cover full sack,
in quotes.

37
00:01:45.732 --> 00:01:49.373
We're gonna cover the command line,
order shells, how the Internet works,

38
00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:50.822
one of my favorite questions.

39
00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:52.689
And then we're gonna cover VIM.

40
00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.480
We're gonna take breaks from
time to time just because, well,

41
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.798
we're gonna learn a lot of new information
and we're gonna load up on that.

42
00:01:58.798 --> 00:02:01.468
And I don't wanna overload anybody, so
we'll take breaks from time to time.

43
00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:06.084
And if we're going too far or
you need to catch up, just say, hey,

44
00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:07.579
Jem, I need a break.

45
00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.272
And we'll take five, that's okay.

46
00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:14.714
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: What is full stack?

47
00:02:14.714 --> 00:02:20.348
Anybody, anybody, anybody in the room,
you could just tell me what full stack is?

48
00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:21.234
What's a full stack engineer?

49
00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:24.239
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No one at all.
Some

50
00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.951
of you said you're a full stack engineers,
so, yes?

51
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:29.567
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, everything
from the client all the way up to

52
00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:30.757
the server-
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

53
00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:32.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The data stores.

54
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.144
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I like that.

55
00:02:36.144 --> 00:02:38.817
The thing about full stack
is it's very contentious.

56
00:02:38.817 --> 00:02:41.568
There are people that are like it's
not possibly a full stack engineer.

57
00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:43.118
That's not even a real thing.

58
00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:44.442
Obviously I disagree.

59
00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:49.106
And mostly I disagree with Bryan Holt,
who is my friend and rival,

60
00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:50.864
bitter, bitter rival.

61
00:02:50.864 --> 00:02:53.522
[LAUGH] He says this is
a full stack developer.

62
00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:55.679
And honestly, I agree with him.

63
00:02:55.679 --> 00:03:00.239
I think it is almost impossible to
be good at every part of the stack.

64
00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.391
You can be good at the front-end, you can
be good at probably some of the back-end.

65
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:04.413
You might be good at databases.

66
00:03:04.413 --> 00:03:05.385
You might be good at security.

67
00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.017
You might be good at performance tuning.

68
00:03:07.017 --> 00:03:11.636
You might be amazing at 3D animations,
but it's really, really,

69
00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:15.628
really, really,
really hard to be amazing at all of them.

70
00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.000
There's very few people
in the world that are.

71
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.590
So if there's parts you don't quite
understand, you're like that's cool but

72
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.090
I don't really wanna dive into
it too much, that's okay.

73
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.170
That's the way it should be.

74
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.581
Find the area that you're passionate
about and then kind of dig into that and

75
00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:29.923
become an expert at that end.

76
00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:36.980
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But when we say, what is
full stack, a lot of frontend engineers,

77
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.467
especially, they're like, well, there's
a frontend, there's a backend somewhere.

78
00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:47.225
And then it works together somehow,
I don't know.

79
00:03:47.225 --> 00:03:49.122
Someone just made an API and I call it.

80
00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:52.091
I've never really given it a lot
of thought about how that works.

81
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:57.214
Or maybe you do a lot of backend work, and
you're saying, well, I make these APIs and

82
00:03:57.214 --> 00:04:01.863
then the frontend calls it somehow and
it gets built, and it comes together.

83
00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:04.163
I don't know,
it just comes together somehow.

84
00:04:04.163 --> 00:04:06.364
And this is where I was a few years ago.

85
00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:07.293
I just thought, well,

86
00:04:07.293 --> 00:04:09.762
I don't need to worry about that
because I'll never touch it.

87
00:04:09.762 --> 00:04:11.790
And that's not quite true.

88
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.405
At some point in your career,
you're gonna have to work on the backend.

89
00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:16.087
Or you're gonna have to
work in the terminal.

90
00:04:16.087 --> 00:04:19.478
Or you're gonna have to work figure
out how to SSH into something and

91
00:04:19.478 --> 00:04:20.502
look at a database.

92
00:04:20.502 --> 00:04:22.850
You're gonna have to
learn all these things.

93
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.026
And that's what this class is for.

94
00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.785
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
why is full stack such a hard definition?

95
00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:32.087
Well, because frontend is
hard enough to define.

96
00:04:32.087 --> 00:04:34.215
So frontend, it could be a car.

97
00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:35.214
Cars have UIs.

98
00:04:35.214 --> 00:04:37.297
Some of them are written in JavaScript.

99
00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:38.711
It can be a TV.

100
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:39.812
Browsers, obviously.

101
00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:42.275
There's desktop apps, mobile devices.

102
00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:44.928
There's appliances like refrigerators and
things like that.

103
00:04:44.928 --> 00:04:49.183
And I'm just skimming the surface of
what it means to be a frontend engineer.

104
00:04:49.183 --> 00:04:53.196
And a lot of times people say,
yeah, frontend is hard, but

105
00:04:53.196 --> 00:04:56.179
interviewing for frontend is even harder.

106
00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:57.492
And it is, and why?

107
00:04:57.492 --> 00:04:58.997
Because of all this.

108
00:04:58.997 --> 00:05:03.286
Literally, frontend covers so
many different use cases, which would be

109
00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:07.798
frontend, that it's really hard to nail
down exactly what a definition is.

110
00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:10.827
And don't fret,
the backend is just as complicated too.

111
00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:13.427
You say, I work on the backend.

112
00:05:13.427 --> 00:05:14.458
What does that mean?

113
00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:15.929
You could be building APIs.

114
00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:17.511
You might be a data scientist.

115
00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:18.805
You might do security.

116
00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:20.585
You might do cyber liability.

117
00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:24.666
You might be some sort of database
engineer, database admin.

118
00:05:24.666 --> 00:05:26.340
Or you might just work on the platform.

119
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.648
Or you could do embedded software.

120
00:05:27.648 --> 00:05:30.817
Or you can do a lot of things
that are considered backend.

121
00:05:30.817 --> 00:05:35.003
But again, it doesn't really
have a hard definition, but

122
00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:40.039
we like to say frontend and
backend just to help differentiate people.

123
00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.039
So, again, we're gonna learn
a lot of new things today.

124
00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.818
If something doesn't quite click with
you or doesn't stick, don't worry,

125
00:05:46.818 --> 00:05:48.662
we're covering so much stuff today.

126
00:05:50.472 --> 00:05:54.315
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So again,
what is full stack at the end of the day?

127
00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:55.921
I liked your definition,

128
00:05:55.921 --> 00:06:00.082
which is someone who can build
an application from start to finish.

129
00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:02.310
Pretty simple, pretty straightforward.

130
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.726
It's someone that if I say I
wanna make the next Netflix,

131
00:06:06.726 --> 00:06:10.314
I wanna make the next Facebook,
that person,

132
00:06:10.314 --> 00:06:15.022
I can give it to you, and
then will start and you'll finish.

133
00:06:15.022 --> 00:06:18.721
You'll come from this crazy idea
to all the way to the finish line.

134
00:06:18.721 --> 00:06:20.405
That means the server, the database.

135
00:06:20.405 --> 00:06:23.235
All these things between, security.

136
00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:25.058
If that sounds daunting,
it's because it is.

137
00:06:25.058 --> 00:06:30.662
[LAUGH] It's really, really, really
difficult to be good at all these things.

138
00:06:30.662 --> 00:06:34.288
But today we're gonna learn all the skills
needed to just understand exactly what's

139
00:06:34.288 --> 00:06:34.850
happening.
