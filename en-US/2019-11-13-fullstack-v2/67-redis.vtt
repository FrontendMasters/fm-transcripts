&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Now I'll briefly talk about
how to install Redis just in case you

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:04.845
want to.

3
00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:06.818
We don't have to because
we're not gonna use it today.

4
00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:12.074
But just in the future if you need to
install it, sudo apt install redis-server.

5
00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:14.311
We're gonna modify the redis.conf,

6
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:17.370
we're gonna modify
the supervised line to systemd.

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.744
So what we're doing is we're
adding it to the system daemon, so

8
00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:23.809
that it will always come online
when the system restarts.

9
00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:29.636
Remember yesterday someone asked about
services, what are services, someone did.

10
00:00:29.636 --> 00:00:34.656
When we talked about services,
when I say sudo nginx service,

11
00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:39.973
etc., using the systemctl,
that's a lower layer of services.

12
00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:44.450
Think of the difference between IP tables
and the UFW, the uncomplicated firewall.

13
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.423
That's the equivalent of services and
systemctl.

14
00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:51.329
The syntax is a bit more verbose, but
it gives you a bit finer grain control.

15
00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.057
So if you ever see that you just think,
it's the same thing as service,

16
00:00:55.057 --> 00:00:56.753
just a little bit more modified.

17
00:00:56.753 --> 00:01:00.405
And if you wanna run Redis with
your Node setup, I used Node Redis,

18
00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:01.329
I use it at work.

19
00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.773
It's a pretty good library for
interfacing with Redis.

20
00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:05.906
Same thing for MySQL.

21
00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:09.621
If you wanna install that,
sudo apt install mysql-server.

22
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:12.085
Then you run setup
mysql_secure_installation and

23
00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:14.115
it'll run you through some sane defaults.

24
00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:18.791
And if you wanna use that with your Node
you can use mysqljs which is pretty good.

25
00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:19.401
It works well.
