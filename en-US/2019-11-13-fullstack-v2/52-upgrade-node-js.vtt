00:00:00.558 --> 00:00:04.225
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And speaking of upgrade,
let's go into upgrading node now,

2
00:00:04.225 --> 00:00:06.705
the default installation is node eight.

3
00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:09.471
I wouldn't say there's any major
security updates as far as I know,

4
00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:10.962
there might be to move into node ten.

5
00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:12.978
But let's just do it because
the syntax a little better.

6
00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:16.421
MPM is a little bit cleaner
on the newer version of node.

7
00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:19.671
And to do this,
we're gonna use this command called curl,

8
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:21.363
which is short for client URL.

9
00:00:21.363 --> 00:00:24.308
It's probably a command you've seen for
and

10
00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:29.901
it's one of the more common commands for
just reading and writing external sources.

11
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.752
And in this case,
because when we did app install yesterday,

12
00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:36.492
we had to use whatever
the app repo is using,

13
00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:40.809
which is always an older version of node,
and we wanna upgrade that.

14
00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.813
So we're actually gonna connect directly
to Node Source, the Debian repo,

15
00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:48.091
and Debian is a flavor of Linux
that maintains these packages.

16
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:54.759
What we're doing, and
I think I put it in the notes here, I did.

17
00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:57.947
And if you're curious about what
we're doing most of the time,

18
00:00:57.947 --> 00:01:00.378
I'm gonna use this thing
called Explainshell.

19
00:01:00.378 --> 00:01:01.690
And I'm using curl.

20
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.649
And this is one of my favorite tools,

21
00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.026
cuz remember when I said man pages
are kind of like, here's some knowledge.

22
00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.057
Explainshell does it much simpler.

23
00:01:10.057 --> 00:01:13.979
So if you're trying to look at
the man page for what curl-sl does,

24
00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.319
it's kind of opaque.

25
00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.875
But using Explainshell, it's really
helpful that we know that it's silent and

26
00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.284
it's just going to run.

27
00:01:21.284 --> 00:01:24.260
The L means it's gonna check
the HTTP is available.

28
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.171
And the O means it's
gonna output to a file.

29
00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:44.465
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Because I am lazy, hm?

30
00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:47.577
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: You will see a file output.

31
00:01:47.577 --> 00:01:49.528
It's pretty fast, within a second so.

32
00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:55.662
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And if you do an ls,
you'll see a node source setup.

33
00:01:55.662 --> 00:01:57.218
Actually I'm gonna remove that test log.

34
00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:03.454
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And if you wanna take a look
at it, which, generally if you're running

35
00:02:03.454 --> 00:02:06.351
downloading scripts on the Internet,
this is a safe site.

36
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:11.775
It's well known, the repo's maintained,
it doesn't have too many security issues.

37
00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:14.346
But generally, you wanna be careful
about downloading running scripts on

38
00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:16.283
the Internet because you
don't know what it's doing.

39
00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:20.513
But let's take a look at
what that script is doing.

40
00:02:20.513 --> 00:02:21.596
And it's a lot,

41
00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:26.327
I'm just showing you this just because
I couldn't go through all of it.

42
00:02:26.327 --> 00:02:28.606
But I do trust the Debian repo and

43
00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:33.687
I know that this is a known way of
installing the latest version of node.

44
00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:36.824
But in general, if someone gives
you a script to run on your server,

45
00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:37.768
don't do it [LAUGH].

46
00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:40.389
There's no good reason to do it.

47
00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.951
And we're just gonna run
this as a bash script.

48
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:44.429
So sudo bash that file we just created.

49
00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:50.933
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Clear sudo bash.

50
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.654
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And what that script is
doing, it's not actually downloading node,

51
00:03:00.654 --> 00:03:04.152
it's just setting the apps pointer
to nodejs to a different source.

52
00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:07.124
So it's saying, hey,
I want to download nodejs.

53
00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:09.632
Here's a newer version of it and
just point to that.

54
00:03:09.632 --> 00:03:17.739
So now we can say sudo apt install nodejs.

55
00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:18.684
And yes.

56
00:03:27.538 --> 00:03:31.082
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Nice, so
now when I do node --version,

57
00:03:31.082 --> 00:03:36.570
see I'm on node 10 rather than node 8,
a little friendlier.

58
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.825
And if you're wondering, Gem, node 11 and
12 are out, why aren't we using those?

59
00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:43.054
I think 12 is out.

60
00:03:43.054 --> 00:03:46.303
10 is the LTS version, and
you remember earlier we talked about LTS,

61
00:03:46.303 --> 00:03:47.889
which means long-term support.

62
00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.024
Node 10 will be maintained,
that means security upgrades,

63
00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:55.623
fixing zero days,
fixing minor bugs until 2021.

64
00:03:55.623 --> 00:03:58.874
That's why we use the LTS version versus
the modern cutting edge version is

65
00:03:58.874 --> 00:04:01.776
probably gonna have more bugs
that haven't been discovered yet.

66
00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:03.817
Maybe some security
exploits we don't know.

67
00:04:03.817 --> 00:04:07.263
So we generally, if we're talking
about servers, run the LTS.

68
00:04:07.263 --> 00:04:10.257
Your personal server,
you run whatever version of node you want,

69
00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:11.491
whatever makes you happy.

70
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:13.728
You want to use asynch 08 and
all that good stuff,

71
00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:15.144
run the latest version of node.

72
00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:19.885
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
we can update our outdated packages.

73
00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:22.342
We only have one right now and
that was npm2.

74
00:04:22.342 --> 00:04:25.303
So we don't actually have to update it
cuz we just installed it yesterday.

75
00:04:25.303 --> 00:04:28.656
But if you wanted to,
you can run sudo npm update -g.

76
00:04:28.656 --> 00:04:31.024
That'll update all your global packages.

77
00:04:31.024 --> 00:04:33.470
And that covers the section on security.

78
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.343
We spent a long time on it.

79
00:04:35.343 --> 00:04:38.357
But we talked about some the consequences
of not securing your application.

80
00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:41.629
We talked about firewalls,
and controlling ports, and

81
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.555
controlling file permissions using the
least permissive permissions as possible.

82
00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:49.004
And we talked about just keeping your
application up to date to prevent

83
00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:49.715
vulnerabilities.
