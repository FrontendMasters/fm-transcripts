00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:00.843
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But I still have a problem.

2
00:00:00.843 --> 00:00:05.671
I don't like that I have to run
node.appjs every single time.

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.637
What happens if I restart my server?

4
00:00:07.637 --> 00:00:09.033
What happens if I just kill it?

5
00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:12.057
What happens if my computer goes to
sleep at this point and the shell exits,

6
00:00:12.057 --> 00:00:14.362
which means it'll kill every
program that's running.

7
00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:18.992
We need some sort of manager so
we're going to use a process manager.

8
00:00:18.992 --> 00:00:23.430
And a process manager is just a way of
keeping your application up and running.

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.844
It can handle errors, it handles restarts.

10
00:00:26.844 --> 00:00:31.840
Let's say you have a place in your code
that throws a non handled exception.

11
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.221
What does that do in Node?

12
00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:34.704
That'll just kill the program.

13
00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:38.154
So you need some sort of service that
handles that and then restarts gracefully.

14
00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:42.110
And it's job is to keep the process up and
running constantly and

15
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.950
it does it in the background.

16
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.467
So today we're gonna use, for
this exercise we're gonna use pm2.

17
00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:53.425
You can also use a program called
forever and forever is good,

18
00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:58.236
it's a perfectly fine process manager,
pm2 is a bit more full featured.

19
00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:01.398
And it's a little bit cleaner to use.

20
00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:04.646
But feel free to use any process manager
you want, but in this case we'll use pm2.

21
00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.605
So we're gonna us npm again.

22
00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:10.424
And because we're doing a global install,
we're gonna have to use the sudo command.

23
00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:14.044
So sudo npm i -g for global pm2.

24
00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:21.372
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes?

25
00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:26.948
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So rule of thumb I've
been told is avoid installing global.

26
00:01:26.948 --> 00:01:30.472
This is an exception where-
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

27
00:01:30.472 --> 00:01:31.904
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What are the exceptions?

28
00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:34.962
When is it safe to use a global install?

29
00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:38.838
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: When you need to run
it globally from any directory.

30
00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:43.159
Because this isn't, let's say I had four
or five other node applications running,

31
00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.851
I want pm2 to access all of that.

32
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:48.667
So installing and locally wouldn't make as
much sense because we didn't then we have

33
00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:51.272
to pipe everything into node modules,
things like that.

34
00:01:51.272 --> 00:01:52.584
But that's an excellent point.

35
00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:56.338
You generally don't want to do
things globally unless you have to.

36
00:01:56.338 --> 00:01:57.872
If you wanna run things globally but

37
00:01:57.872 --> 00:02:00.438
from the local directory you
can use something called MPX.

38
00:02:00.438 --> 00:02:03.294
Which will look at first in your local and
then move up.

39
00:02:03.294 --> 00:02:06.898
But in this case, we wanna run globally
because its a process manager.

40
00:02:06.898 --> 00:02:09.460
Great question though,
that is staying on top of things.

41
00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:21.518
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Awesome,
that was a big install.

42
00:02:21.518 --> 00:02:28.593
Man, there's a lot to this thing,
good times.

43
00:02:28.593 --> 00:02:32.252
Anyways, no one ever looks at
the library being installed.

44
00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.628
If you asked me what are my issues
with npm, and it's not npm,

45
00:02:34.628 --> 00:02:37.616
it's just package managers, is you
don't know what's actually going on.

46
00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.450
You have no idea what any
of these packages do.

47
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.320
Again it's trust,

48
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.559
the Internet's built on trust and
I trust that this is working correctly.

49
00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.963
Tomorrow we're going to run
a higher version of node,

50
00:02:47.963 --> 00:02:50.707
just because I like to
use modern features.

51
00:02:50.707 --> 00:02:53.779
But we're using the baseline
install that came with,

52
00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:58.606
because we installed from the apt repo,
they're always behind, I don't know why.

53
00:02:58.606 --> 00:03:00.746
But today I didn't wanna
go into how to change that,

54
00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.460
how to point that to a different version.

55
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.974
But tomorrow we're gonna run probably node
10, or 12, or whatever the LTS version is.

56
00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:09.356
But for today we're okay.

57
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:15.685
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
let's go ahead and start pm2.

58
00:03:15.685 --> 00:03:21.187
So pm2 start app.js.

59
00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:25.449
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Cool, and

60
00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:31.370
it's now running with id 0 because
it's only thing running right now.

61
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.606
What's nice is now,
I can go do whatever I want and

62
00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:35.376
it's just running in the background.

63
00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:40.785
If it crashes it's going to do its
absolute best to keep it up, just in case.

64
00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:44.181
But to make sure that it starts
when the server restarts,

65
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:49.091
because right now if the server restarts,
we still have to go pm2 start app.js.

66
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:53.834
We can modify the pm2 startup file so that
it creates a daemon that will always start

67
00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:56.289
our application when we start the server.

68
00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:57.751
So we'll say pm2 startup.

69
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:05.562
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Cool.

70
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:15.804
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I don't think I
need to set the startup script.

71
00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:19.555
I think it does it for
me, but we'll check.

72
00:04:19.555 --> 00:04:22.287
So what I'm gonna do now,
we get to version control,

73
00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:23.699
make sure I did that right.

74
00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.668
We may actually have to copy and
paste this in.

75
00:04:25.668 --> 00:04:29.373
But I don't think I had to do that
when I ran this through last time.

76
00:04:29.373 --> 00:04:35.206
But what I'm gonna do to test this out,
is I'm gonna take down my server.

77
00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:38.126
The fastest way to find out
if you did things correctly.

78
00:04:38.126 --> 00:04:42.170
And I'm gonna turn it off, yeah, turn off.

79
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.466
It takes a second, cool.

80
00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:51.859
The server is off and
let's turn it back on.

81
00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:57.103
Give it a minute,
is it up and running yet?

82
00:04:57.103 --> 00:04:59.183
I just used just the off button.

83
00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:05.181
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Which, it's not terribly
useful because you still, and

84
00:05:05.181 --> 00:05:07.568
Digital Ocean will tell you this,
you're still getting billed.

85
00:05:07.568 --> 00:05:08.686
Just cuz you turn it off,

86
00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:11.999
doesn't mean you deallocated yourself,
just means it's not running.

87
00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:14.708
An important distinction,
cuz you might turn it off and think well,

88
00:05:14.708 --> 00:05:16.960
I won't need the server,
they're still charging you.

89
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.242
[LAUGH] So your mileage may vary.

90
00:05:20.242 --> 00:05:21.002
Okay is the server up?

91
00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:22.961
It might take a second.

92
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:27.087
So pm2 status,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

93
00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:29.120
we got the app running, so pm2 save.

94
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:34.760
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Cool, so now it's saved.

95
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.543
When the server restarts, pm2 will
get up and running as it did before.

96
00:05:39.543 --> 00:05:42.801
This is actually a pretty big deal
cuz you'll forget to do it and

97
00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.223
you will kill your server.

98
00:05:44.223 --> 00:05:49.013
Everything is working, check this out mom,
and you're like, I don't see anything,

99
00:05:49.013 --> 00:05:51.424
you're a failure as a son and
as a engineer.

100
00:05:51.424 --> 00:05:54.143
No, that doesn't matter,
my mom loves me no matter what.

101
00:05:54.143 --> 00:05:56.470
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH] That's way too

102
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.140
much information.
