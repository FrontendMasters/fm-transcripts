&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And the last section on
containers and general load balancing

2
00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.164
engine x tweaking this advanced
things is deployments.

3
00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:11.143
We talked about orchestration as
a way of deploying containers.

4
00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:14.514
But if we weren't using micro services and
containers,

5
00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.405
what's a faster way of
deploying 20 servers?

6
00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:21.684
I don't necessarily wanna go
through Jem Young's full stack for

7
00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:25.279
front end course and
be like then I copy my SSH key over.

8
00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.507
And then I wanna run all these
scripts to install everything.

9
00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:31.605
You have to do that every time 20 times.

10
00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:32.143
That's not scalable.

11
00:00:32.143 --> 00:00:36.539
Fortunately, there are tools out there
that you set up a configuration scripts.

12
00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.979
And you give it some resources and some
server IPs and you can set up hundreds or

13
00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:42.768
thousands of servers at once.

14
00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:49.163
So the more popular tools to be answerable
vagrant and puppet or chef is another one.

15
00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:52.719
These are really popular tools for
spinning up 20 servers are taking down

16
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.720
20 servers, hundreds servers,
and thousands of servers.

17
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.962
When you get really good, you'll just
take everything that we did earlier and

18
00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:03.958
you put it in the scripts and then you
just roll that out every single time.

19
00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.301
And because remember,
at the end of the day,

20
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:08.467
the best engineers are the laziest ones.

21
00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:12.594
So if you can script all that repeated
work that we did configuring engine x and

22
00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:16.595
all these things into one simple scripts,
that just makes your life much,

23
00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:17.378
much easier.
