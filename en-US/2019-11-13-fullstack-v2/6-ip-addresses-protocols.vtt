00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But
the Internet runs on trust.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.290
And it's a really weird concept that,
collectively as humanity,

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.940
we have our disagreements on politics and
war and

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.190
the best type of burrito, but
we all collectively said, hey,

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.550
let's agree on a set of standards that
my computer can talk to your computer.

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.760
And this is a really big deal
in the course of mankind.

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.300
And, no, I'm not saying the Internet's
the greatest invention in the course

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.850
of mankind.

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.760
But the fact that we can have
these disparate ideas about

10
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.950
how software engineering should work,
what's the best programming language,

11
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.670
what's the best operating system, but
we all agree on this set of standards and

12
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.528
protocols that we can talk to
each other I think is incredible.

13
00:00:40.528 --> 00:00:45.090
I think our cooperation is one of
the things that separates us from animals,

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.900
like animals can't collectively
cooperate to the level that we can, and

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.050
that's reflected in the Internet.

16
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.560
Can you tell I'm passionate
about what I do?

17
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.940
That I'm talking about humanity and
social sciences and all that things.

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.970
But the Internet runs on this trust
system, and it's a series of protocols

19
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.350
that everybody sat down to agree
to like 30 years ago or something.

20
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.820
They said, hey,
this is how my computer can talk to you.

21
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.990
And that protocol is called IP,
and that just stands for

22
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.670
Internet Protocol,
pretty easy to remember.

23
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.240
You've probably heard TCP/IP.

24
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.890
TCP is Transmission Control Protocol,
we'll talk about that in a second.

25
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.411
But it's just this collective idea that
if I send you some data it's well-formed

26
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:27.697
enough that you say, okay,
I know how to accept this data.

27
00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:30.947
I know how to write it, read it, and
I know how to send it back to you to

28
00:01:30.947 --> 00:01:33.823
let you know that I got it,
that's the Internet Protocol.

29
00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:35.530
IP address you're probably
all familiar with.

30
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.742
It's a set of numbers that
just denotes an address,

31
00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:41.299
just like a postal address, same thing.

32
00:01:43.994 --> 00:01:47.220
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: IPv4,
that's the thing that I grew up with.

33
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.860
That's just a series of numbers,
much shorter, there are, wait,

34
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.678
I think I have it in my secret notes,
I do.

35
00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:59.180
There are 4.3 billion IP addresses,
which at the time people were like,

36
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.850
there will never be more
computers than that.

37
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.070
We've already blown past that.

38
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.120
We've actually run out of IP addresses.

39
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.070
So if it gives you an idea of
how ubiquitous the Internet is,

40
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.670
there are over 3.4 billion devices
connected the Internet right now,

41
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.600
which is kind of wild
when you think about it.

42
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.506
But again, this just shows you
a lesson in history to plan ahead.

43
00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.780
[LAUGH] They thought
3.4 billion was enough.

44
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.000
It wasn't enough, we ran out.

45
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.250
So they invented this thing called IPv6.

46
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.200
IPv6 is a series looks like this.

47
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.990
There's bigger numbers and
there's, wait, see,

48
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.370
I've got it in my notes, 340 decillion.

49
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.080
I don't even know if
I'm saying that right.

50
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.370
3.4 to 10 to the 38.

51
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.570
That is hopefully enough.

52
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.550
[LAUGH] Hopefully enough addresses
that we won't run out anytime soon.

53
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.054
We'll see what happens in the future,
though, you never know.

54
00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:55.340
Maybe we'll go to Mars and
by that time I'll be dead and hopefully

55
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.090
no one's watching this course because, if
so, we have bigger problems in the world.

56
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.570
But these are IP addresses.

57
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.240
So they're addresses that
are used by the Internet Protocol

58
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.590
to kind of talk to each other,
just let you know, hey, here I am.

59
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.190
Here's how to get to me.

60
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.440
Like I said, this all runs on
a different protocol called TCP.

61
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.931
And most of you heard TCP over IP, or
IP over TCP, it's just a protocol and

62
00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:26.190
a standardization of how
computers can talk to each other.

63
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.870
And you also hear the phrase UDP.

64
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.150
Probably people are a little less
familiar with UDP because it's

65
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.530
used heavily but you probably
don't use it in your day to day.

66
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.440
Does anybody know the difference
between TCP and UDP?

67
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.140
Sam, I see you nodding.

68
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.658
Anybody else want to take a crack?

69
00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.795
Anybody?

70
00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:47.416
Jimmy.

71
00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:56.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: TCP has to negotiate
the connection for each file.

72
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.860
UDP is capable of
negotiating a connection and

73
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.560
then it leaves the connection open while
it's communicating with the same server.

74
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.070
As soon as it finishes uploading or
downloading the first files it says, okay,

75
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.990
and then next and then next.

76
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.680
So it minimizes the round trips, or
the back and forth conversation, that's

77
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.860
needed in order to begin transferring and
continue transferring files.

78
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.880
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That's exactly right,
great answer.

79
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.090
TCP it's lossless, it's guaranteed that

80
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.650
if I send you some information
over TCP it's going to make it.

81
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.950
It has things called error correction,
error checking.

82
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.810
UDP is different where I just say, hey,

83
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.430
and I assume you heard me and I don't
care if you didn't, and that's UDP.

84
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.460
Essentially, it's just
a one-way blast of information.

85
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.400
And you can see why UDP is faster than TCP
because TCP has to say, hey, you there?

86
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.150
And that's called a SYN packet, S-Y-N.

87
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.430
And then the client responds like,
yeah, I'm here with an ACK.

88
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.760
So it sends an ACK package.

89
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.200
You don't need to know this stuff, but
it's just like that nerd level trivia that

90
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.300
I, I wanna make you look cool at
the bar next time you're hanging out.

91
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.740
You're like, yeah, something's TCP and
IP packets, things like that.

92
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.690
But it negotiates this connection.

93
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.680
So it says SYN and then it says SYN-ACK,
and then it sends ACK, and

94
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.090
then you start transferring data.

95
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.960
So there's already four or
five connections before any data is

96
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.380
even really sent versus UDP which is just,
hey, did you get it?

97
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.860
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

98
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.970
Don't care.

99
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:27.895
I'm just sending you data.

100
00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.410
I'm just sending you data.

101
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.397
And actually I have a good joke
about UDP but you might not get it.

102
00:05:35.397 --> 00:05:35.984
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just say it, though.

103
00:05:35.984 --> 00:05:37.278
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No, that was the joke.

104
00:05:37.278 --> 00:05:37.881
See?

105
00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:39.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Thank you,

106
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.460
thank you person in the back of the room.

107
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.740
That was Mark.

108
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.060
Yeah, that was some nerd jokes for you.

109
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.960
So let's try an exercise, let's try ping.

110
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.410
Ping is a really short request.

111
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.840
It just says, hey, hey, hey,
hey, that's all it does.

112
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.258
So let's go in ping twitter.com and into
your terminal, so I'm gonna do that here.

113
00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:10.160
Say ping twitter.com.

114
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.550
Hey, it's there, it's alive.

115
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.588
And to kill it we just Ctrl+C.

116
00:06:14.588 --> 00:06:16.923
Way to kill anything, Ctrl+C.

117
00:06:16.923 --> 00:06:21.704
So everybody successfully, I assume if
you're watching me on the Internet your

118
00:06:21.704 --> 00:06:25.310
Internet works and
you successfully pinged twitter.com.

119
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.013
And all this is saying is,
hey, are you there?

120
00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:28.600
Are you there?

121
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.100
Are you there?

122
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.340
And so like, yeah, I'm here,
I'm here, I'm here.

123
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.130
Ping is useful for debugging your site.

124
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.700
If you're saying, man, my clients
are saying the connection's really slow.

125
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.390
What's the cheapest, easiest way to
find out is my site up and running?

126
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.520
And how long's that round trip time?

127
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.730
So the round trip refers to
when I send the packet out and

128
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.990
it comes back, and
we're just measuring that.

129
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.840
Another thing it measures is, well,
I'll talk about hops in a second.

130
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.240
I'll talk about hops and trace route.

131
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.560
But ping is just a nice utility to have
in your back pocket just to say like,

132
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.360
hey, is the site up?

133
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.040
Yeah, cool.
