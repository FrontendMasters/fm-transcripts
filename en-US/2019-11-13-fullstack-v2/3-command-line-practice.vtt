00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So let's start off
with an exercise, first exercise.

2
00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.705
We're just gonna play around with
the command line, just a little bit,

3
00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.294
just iin case you're comfortable.

4
00:00:07.294 --> 00:00:11.781
I know some of you have some
Fullsac experience, which is great.

5
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:15.629
Some of you have never touched the command
line, other than, maybe doing Git or

6
00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:16.730
something like that.

7
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.564
So, just play around with it, knowing
you're probably not gonna break anything I

8
00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:24.374
say probably cuz I'm not at your computer,
and I don't know what you're doing.

9
00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:27.100
I don't know if you're sitting on
a couch at home watching Netflix,

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.329
not really paying attention.

11
00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.587
But don't worry, I'm not gonna
lead you too far astray today.

12
00:00:31.587 --> 00:00:37.590
The command line has,
well, it's a command line.

13
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.140
It had different commands to do things.

14
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.309
These are some of the more familiar ones,
and the ones that I use all the time.

15
00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.687
Today, we're gonna use cd a lot.

16
00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:47.013
That's just moving directories.

17
00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:50.256
Pwd is useful,
it always looks like password to me, but

18
00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.192
it's print working directory.

19
00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:55.003
Actually, I'll just do some examples now.

20
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.684
So, oops, execute over here.

21
00:00:57.684 --> 00:01:01.618
And if you want to clear you can just
type clear in your command line.

22
00:01:01.618 --> 00:01:06.919
So if I wanna say pwd, which means I'm in
slash, I'm in the root of my computer.

23
00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:11.815
Ls is gonna list all the files and
I can say, ls,

24
00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:15.866
actually I'll say cd into slash etcd.

25
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.270
Now, I'm in etc.

26
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.379
And the back out cd1 to go nowhere,
just cd1.

27
00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:27.774
You're probably familiar with the synod,

28
00:01:27.774 --> 00:01:31.668
if you want to acquire a file in
the same directory, you just dot slash.

29
00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:33.583
Cd dot dot means move up directory.

30
00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:36.330
Dot dot dot means move up two directories,
etc., etc.

31
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.994
I know I'm going over the basics.

32
00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:39.136
That's how this day's going to go.

33
00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:42.299
We're going to start off really slow.

34
00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.012
So slow, you're like, why am I here?

35
00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:49.397
Man, this is bad idea I could have been
watching, I don't know sports ball or

36
00:01:49.397 --> 00:01:50.145
something.

37
00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:53.250
But I'm, here,
which we're doing these basic things.

38
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.205
But we start off slow we will
need the command line, so

39
00:01:56.205 --> 00:01:57.658
play around with it a bit.

40
00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:01.942
Cat is really useful if you wanna
file you just cat a file and

41
00:02:01.942 --> 00:02:03.964
just print out the output.

42
00:02:03.964 --> 00:02:09.539
Man, we're gonna use, just because
you won't know all the commands.

43
00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.877
And if you're ever curious
about something we can do

44
00:02:13.877 --> 00:02:18.322
things like man cat and
it pulls up the manual for cat.

45
00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:22.535
Always useful, I'll say this about man
pages, are not all sunshine and roses.

46
00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:25.861
Everything's great in Linux land and
it all makes so much sense.

47
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:27.609
Man pages are not easy to read.

48
00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.552
What I recommend usually is just doing
a query search, Google, Bing, whatever

49
00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:37.367
your preferred search engine is for
the actual command you're trying to use.

50
00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:42.796
But for basic things using the man
page just tells you what it's supposed

51
00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:48.060
to do and if you wanna search you can
type slash and I don't know, cat.

52
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.777
And it pulls up things.

53
00:02:50.777 --> 00:02:54.696
And I can, it keeps moving.

54
00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:56.331
And to quit, just type q.

55
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:59.514
I had some jokes about man kill and
all these things, but

56
00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:01.626
I thought they were inappropriate.

57
00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:03.982
No?

58
00:03:03.982 --> 00:03:05.244
They're not inappropriate.

59
00:03:05.244 --> 00:03:07.758
So kill is just a way
of killing a process.

60
00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:12.285
And we hopefully won't do anything
that requires using kill.

61
00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:13.912
But if you get stuck somewhere and

62
00:03:13.912 --> 00:03:16.247
there is a process just
running how do I kill it?

63
00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:18.938
You start kill by process name.

64
00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:23.569
Pkill is useful because instead of using
the idea of the thing that's running,

65
00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.782
I can just type pkill node and
I don't have any node process running, but

66
00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:29.665
it'll kill your node process.

67
00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:33.050
This one I use a lot because [LAUGH] at
work our node process gets hung up and

68
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.074
it's frustrating.

69
00:03:34.074 --> 00:03:39.531
It's okay.

70
00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:42.713
If you wanna remove file,
rm, pretty explanatory.

71
00:03:42.713 --> 00:03:47.785
Echo repeats a file or
repeats an input for whatever you type in.

72
00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:53.927
Ls is useful, ls is like cat
except cat displays everything.

73
00:03:53.927 --> 00:03:57.169
So if you have a one megabyte file,
cat will just dump it all to your screen,

74
00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.388
which sometimes you want,
sometimes you don't.

75
00:03:59.388 --> 00:04:03.050
Ls is like a better cat,
where it only does one page at a time.

76
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.537
So it's a bit more useful than cat, but
we'll probably switch off between both.

77
00:04:07.537 --> 00:04:14.414
If you want to make a directory mkdir,
remove directory rmdir, yeah.

78
00:04:14.414 --> 00:04:16.073
Is this familiar to anybody?

79
00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:19.025
No you've probably all seen
most of this before, but

80
00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.595
it's good to kind of lay
it out as a structure.
