00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's talk about SSH by
now we're in the portion of DigitalOcean

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.810
where it says hey how do you wanna
log in you can use SSH keys or

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.970
you can use a one time password.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.530
And it's tempting to use a password
because it's simpler that is email to you,

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.250
you log in you're good to
go you only think about it.

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.715
But we want to use an SSH key.

7
00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:24.390
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
this a whole bit on security.

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.400
And security is really important.

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.830
But what I'll tell you about
security there is basic two ways

10
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.100
of getting into a server if you're
securing something their SSH keys.

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.900
And there's username and password.

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.450
SSH stands for Secure Socket Shell,
it is a, well, I'll get to it in a minute.

13
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.270
But it's a very large key that
is as of now unbreakable.

14
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.020
And so it's a much secure way
of logging into your server.

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.990
The switch is made up of two parts,
that's why it's usually, for

16
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.890
all us, a key pair but
I'll just call it key.

17
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.980
There's a public key
There's a private key.

18
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.760
And the way that works is

19
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.260
the private key stays on your computer on
your phone wherever you wanna keep it.

20
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.220
The public key goes on a server.

21
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.830
And what happens is everything is
encrypted with the private key.

22
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.260
So when it's encrypted,
it goes in transit, and

23
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.250
no one can intercept what's happening.

24
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.270
That's actually called a tunnel or a pipe,
if you will, because everything when you

25
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.800
establish that connection, everything in
the pipe is unbreakable for the most part.

26
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.190
I say everything in caveats because
if the NSA wants to come after you,

27
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.790
they're gonna get you.

28
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.820
[LAUGH] All the SSH keys in
the world won't save you.

29
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.870
But generally, SSH keys are not generally.

30
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.310
SSH keys are the strongest
authentication we can get right now.

31
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.210
And it's such a really, I like the idea
of SSH keys because it's just a really

32
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.520
powerful concept, where I encrypt
something, or you can encrypt something,

33
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.330
and the only way to decrypt it
is with a key that only I have.

34
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.660
So you can send me a message
using my public key.

35
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.990
And the only way that any and anybody can
get it you can get that you'll just get

36
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.810
like a blob of text that means nothing.

37
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.430
But the only way to decrypt
it was my private key.

38
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.930
So it's like it's a good
one way encryption where

39
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.590
you don't have to trust me.

40
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.200
You don't have to know me.

41
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.250
You just encrypt it, and I can decrypt it.

42
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.650
I'm the only one and
anybody can intercept it in transit and

43
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.230
won't mean anything to them.

44
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.810
It's really a brilliant system
that we kind of take for

45
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.330
granted that's really simple,
versus what are the alternatives?

46
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.620
User name and password,
where I need to know a username and

47
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.440
I need to know a password.

48
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.990
And if someone steals that username and
password I have to reset everything.

49
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.520
And at some point I need the transmit that
username and password over the pipe, and

50
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.810
if someone's sitting in the middle,
they can intercept that.

51
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.640
And they're like, cool.

52
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.890
I got your username password versus
SSH key that the private key

53
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.660
never leaves my computer and
never leaves the network.

54
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.980
So you can send me all the data you want.

55
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.950
They can be a person in the middle,
aka man in the middle,

56
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.920
intercepting all your traffic.

57
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.770
And it means jibberish.

58
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.420
versus using a username password.

59
00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.730
That's why we're using SSH keys.
