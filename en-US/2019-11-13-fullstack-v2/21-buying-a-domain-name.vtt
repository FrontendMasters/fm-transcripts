00:00:00.818 --> 00:00:06.462
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right, we've got our
server, and what can we do with a server?

2
00:00:09.228 --> 00:00:10.643
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's a trick question,
we can do whatever we want.

3
00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:14.505
This is our computer, we can make it
respond to requests that we want.

4
00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:17.853
We can make it respond to pings,
we can make it not respond to pings.

5
00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:20.699
Over the next couple hours more instance,

6
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.871
tomorrow we'll do some
more advanced things.

7
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:26.015
But for today,
we're gonna set up a server,

8
00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:29.461
we're gonna switch user we're gonna
make that user have permissions to

9
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:32.072
do everything that we wanted
to do within guidelines.

10
00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:37.407
But like I said, we're in route now
you can tell by the hash sign and

11
00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:42.568
the same thing I can clear it out,
so I want to I wanna say who am I?

12
00:00:44.493 --> 00:00:47.001
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's a real question I asked
myself any day when I look in the mirror I

13
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:47.932
say, who am I, really?

14
00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:51.666
But I'm root and we don't wanna be root,

15
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:57.010
we wanna be someone else,
I wanna be Jim, you wanna be you.

16
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.414
You wanna be something
other than you root,

17
00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:05.290
in fact you almost never wanna do
things as root because it's to

18
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.691
the fact that when someone says
your hackers computer cool person.

19
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:13.376
No people come up to me
like I've got root and

20
00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:16.653
that means that they have
full access to your server.

21
00:01:16.653 --> 00:01:19.743
In fact, its own broken and
had access is just regular me.

22
00:01:19.743 --> 00:01:23.297
There's probably they could do some
stuff they can cause some trouble but

23
00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:23.935
not as much.

24
00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:26.518
But if they have root,
they can do lots and lots of bad things.

25
00:01:26.518 --> 00:01:30.818
But before we do that,
I wanna buy a domain, all right, and

26
00:01:30.818 --> 00:01:34.097
the domain you want it's totally optional.

27
00:01:34.097 --> 00:01:37.715
You don't have to buy a domain, and you
probably want one cuz we're gonna set up

28
00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:40.423
a subdomain we're gonna do lots
of other things like that.

29
00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:44.627
But you don't actually need to, you can
use an IP address for everything, but

30
00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:48.385
I wanted to buy a domain because it's
the final step in setting up a real

31
00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:50.831
application, a real website for a company.

32
00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:54.558
I use namecheap.com,
you can use anything you want,

33
00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:59.267
we're not gonna do too much with
the actual domain provider itself.

34
00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:01.885
But I use Namecheap because that
where all my domains are hosted.

35
00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:08.897
That's I know their layout, their UI is a
bit dated, in my opinion, sorry Namecheap.

36
00:02:08.897 --> 00:02:12.123
But buy domain you can use Google,
you can use Go Daddy,

37
00:02:12.123 --> 00:02:13.919
you can use whatever you want.

38
00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.335
Buy something cheap because
it is your test domain, or

39
00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:19.815
buy a real domain cuz you're setting up
a real server, it's wholey up to you.

40
00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:23.058
I'm gonna buy the funniest domain
name I could think of, and

41
00:02:23.058 --> 00:02:24.590
we'll see if he can beat me.

42
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.298
So I'm gonna use Namecheap,
there's no referral link or

43
00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:30.185
anything like that, you can use Google or
any hosts you want.

44
00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:35.076
I recommend .party cuz it's a cheap
domain and it's funny but you do you, so

45
00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:39.817
if you bought a, lot of people will sit
on domains they bought a years ago for

46
00:02:39.817 --> 00:02:42.921
some side project that
they never got around to.

47
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:46.820
And it's not my job to make you feel
guilty about that, you're a busy person,

48
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.199
you don't have time to
explore these domains.

49
00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.699
But, just so you might have had one
sitting around, feel like myself,

50
00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.629
I have like 20 domains that
were just sitting there.

51
00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.829
Well, I can tell you,
last class I brought jem.party,

52
00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.831
which is pretty funny but that was
the last class, I wanna mix it up.

53
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:08.138
So I bought jem is the best,
jemisthe.best, yes, that's a real domain.

54
00:03:08.138 --> 00:03:12.941
I tried to buy party.monster, but
it's like $20,000 party.monster.

55
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.983
Anyways, hopefully you pick something
memorable and easy to type and

56
00:03:16.983 --> 00:03:21.315
nothing too long cuz you will be typing
it quite a bit, if not, it's okay.

57
00:03:21.315 --> 00:03:24.849
You can just use the IP address for
now like we said earlier, domain name is

58
00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.399
just to help you remember that because
you're not given your IP address.

59
00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:33.155
But earlier we talked about how domains
get results via the name servers, but

60
00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:38.515
the results because the name servers keep
records, and they're called DNS records.

61
00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:43.660
And there's different types of DNS
records depending on what you wanna do.

62
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.455
Most records are called A records,
and they map a name to an IP address.

63
00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:53.879
For instance, jemoung.com maps to
23.whatever dot, that works, see, I don't

64
00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.253
remember my own IP address, I've had it
for like seven years, so I don't remember.

65
00:03:58.253 --> 00:04:04.432
The other record you wanna know about is
the CNAME, and that just maps an A or

66
00:04:04.432 --> 00:04:09.448
an a canonical name to a different
name versus an IP address.

67
00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:13.799
For example, jemyoug.com is a A record, so

68
00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.841
it maps jemyoug.com to 23.23.185.61

69
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:24.125
versus blog.jemyoug.com,
that is a CNAME record.

70
00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:26.965
Because it maps the sub
domain to an IP address,

71
00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:31.310
it actually maps it to jemyoug.com and
then that maps it to 23.23.

72
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.784
And the way we can do this,

73
00:04:32.784 --> 00:04:37.020
we can check on the records that a given
domain has is we use the dig command.

74
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.954
So let's go and try that out,
you can use it on your server or not.

75
00:04:40.954 --> 00:04:44.492
I'm gonna exit my server cuz I
don't like doing things with root,

76
00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.635
you just never know.

77
00:04:45.635 --> 00:04:51.379
So I'm gonna exit and run dig, and
I'll say run dig on jemyoung.com,

78
00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.560
we'll see what kinda records we have.

79
00:04:57.303 --> 00:04:58.901
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Anything interesting?

80
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.887
Yeah, so right now we just have one,
we have an A record,

81
00:05:01.887 --> 00:05:05.018
which we talked about earlier and
that's this IP address.

82
00:05:05.018 --> 00:05:07.210
And you can run dig on most domains and

83
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.313
it's just gonna dig up what sort of
records it has who holds records,

84
00:05:11.313 --> 00:05:15.226
essentially like who owns this
phone book that maps this to this.

85
00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:18.844
But if I say dig,
I'll say blog.jemyoung.com,

86
00:05:18.844 --> 00:05:23.909
which is a sub domain,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It gives me a 2.

87
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.346
It gives me a CNAME,
which redirects jemyoung.com, and

88
00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:30.651
then it gives me the A record
which maps to the actual IP.

89
00:05:30.651 --> 00:05:33.777
So we see the CNAME,
just maps to a different domain, and

90
00:05:33.777 --> 00:05:36.070
then internally that maps to an A record.

91
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.321
I know you're like, why should I care?

92
00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:42.118
Well you care because we're
about to set it up right now,

93
00:05:42.118 --> 00:05:46.271
and I want you to know what you're doing,
and I'm not just self telling you things.

94
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:50.002
But again that was dig,
so you can say man dig,

95
00:05:50.002 --> 00:05:53.851
it has the utility,
pretty straightforward.

96
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:57.117
Its good if you wanna know who has
information about our website things

97
00:05:57.117 --> 00:05:57.680
like that.
