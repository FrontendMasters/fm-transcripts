&gt;&gt; Jem Young: How does the Internet work?

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.628
Internet runs over TCPIP.

3
00:00:04.628 --> 00:00:07.540
Which is a protocol that
everybody agrees on.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.439
And on that packets.

5
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.633
The packets are the space you the
information that everybody knows how to

6
00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:13.140
communicate with.

7
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.840
And they know how to transfer data.

8
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.190
They know how to send data.

9
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.930
There's different types.

10
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.239
There's the ICMP packets.

11
00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.890
which is the DIFFTEMP protocol,
just kind of a checks, if you will.

12
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.580
And it all runs on the series of trusts.

13
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.200
And trust means that if
I send you this packet.

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.930
I guarantee you're gonna hand
it off to the next person.

15
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.530
And we know that if we type
in a domain into the browser,

16
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.170
that gets resolved by the name
servers using the DNS system.

17
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.680
And that resolves into a server
somewhere in the server.

18
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.230
We'll get to that part.

19
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.060
For the rest of the course.

20
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.730
But the server is what handles that data.

21
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.500
Not bad right,
we all understand how the internet works.

22
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.560
Now, if you want a bit of politics.

23
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.170
People talk about net neutrality and
what exactly it is.

24
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.050
It's this trust system that if
I send a packet of data to,

25
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.250
I don't know, Sri Lanka I know that I
will probably get there because that's

26
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.190
just the way the internet works.

27
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.990
We all trust each other.

28
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.740
We just keep handing off that data.

29
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.690
Net neutrality means
that ISP can say like,

30
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.390
hey, you're sending a text to Sri Lanka,
actually, you know what I wanna do,

31
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.790
I want to tax every bit of data that comes
into this particular area, because you

32
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.940
know what, I can do that So rather than
this trust system, Just saying, actually,

33
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.020
I'm gonna start charging you data
depending on where it's going.

34
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.540
If you pay me a little bit more money.

35
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.170
I'll make sure your data gets
there a little bit faster.

36
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.770
And that's the debate
between net neutrality.

37
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.570
Should the internet providers
be just these dumb pipes that

38
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.170
if I send a letter it just gets there?

39
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.990
Or should they start prioritizing traffic
based on how much someone pays me.

40
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.170
Again, I didn't take a side in this debate
I was explaining what the argument about

41
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.600
net neutrality is, now you know.

42
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.390
And now you know how the Internet works.

43
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.140
So where I said the full-stack
is good because

44
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.440
you work on the back-end
a lot it doesn't change.

45
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.820
This is the pythonclock.org counter.

46
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.080
Python 3 came out over ten years ago.

47
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.570
There are still people using Python 2,
in fact even at Netflix,

48
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.540
I got an email recently,
hey we're retiring Python 2, finally.

49
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.070
That was 11 years ago when the new
version of Python came out.

50
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.880
That's how slowly things
move on the back end.

51
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.670
So if you want the slower life,
maybe full stack might your bag.

52
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.690
Just throwing that out there, I'm not
throwing shade on people that do Python.
