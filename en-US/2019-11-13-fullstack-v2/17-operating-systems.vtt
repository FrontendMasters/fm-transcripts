1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.750
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And now, I'm gonna
talk about operating system just for

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.950
a little bit.

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.650
Why do we chose Ubuntu?

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.970
Anybody?
What is Ubuntu?

5
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.200
What type of operating system is that?

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.910
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Linux.

7
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.120
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, it's Linux.

8
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.110
Linux is based on the unique system.

9
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.040
Just why I choose Ubuntu.

10
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.220
And there's two main types
of operating system.

11
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.220
There's windows and there's Unix based.

12
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.000
The way they work is very different.

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.250
Windows has this idea of MS DOS.

14
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.590
Which is kind of their underlying core.

15
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.770
It's kind of the shell you use versus Unix
which is a system designed in 70s 60s.

16
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.580
I don't remember it's very old but Unix is
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is in

17
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.380
the 60s
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: 60s

18
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.160
yeah
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Bell Labs

19
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.227
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, Bell Labs, yeah.

20
00:00:50.227 --> 00:00:52.870
Bell Labs,yeah,
they said a lot whatever the Bell Labs.

21
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.170
Anyways probably mismanagement.

22
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.450
Unix is not terribly friendly.

23
00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.950
Unix is.

24
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.960
What the nerds use so
we use a flavor of Unix called Linux.

25
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.150
Linux is much friendlier.

26
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.460
It stays up to date as
invented by Linus Torvalds.

27
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.650
Hence the name Linux.

28
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.960
Yeah.
There's also different flavors of Unix.

29
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.396
There's BSD, there's solaris BSD is a,

30
00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:22.290
runs down to freeBSD.

31
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.920
And OSX the laptop I'm using
most you're using here.

32
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.770
It runs on freeBSD.

33
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.750
So it's a flavor of Linux or flavor
of Unix, not quite the same as Linux.

34
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.860
But it's close enough for
most tools we care about today.

35
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.389
But we're gonna use ubuntu which is.

36
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.840
Arguably the most popular
distribution of Linux.

37
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.400
There's Debian, red hat, fedora.

38
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.870
There's a lot.

39
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.470
There's tails which is like a super
privacy heavy Linux version.

40
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.740
There's a lot of Linux
versions the great thing about

41
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.210
Linux I'd say vs windows
is it's open source.

42
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.330
So if you're like,
I don't like the way this thing looks.

43
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.200
You can modify it,
you can make your own version.

44
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.660
And there are a tonne
of versions of Linux.

45
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.040
There's a tonne of
goodies on top of Linux.

46
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.100
But today we're not gonna
be using any gooey,

47
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.410
just straight,
good old fashioned command line.

48
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.144
there any questions about Linux.

49
00:02:13.144 --> 00:02:18.218
Because we're gonna dive in.

50
00:02:18.218 --> 00:02:19.700
Alright.

51
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.660
Linux, it works on the principle of two.

52
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.080
It's actually as straightforward
as they can make it.

53
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.932
There's the kernel.

54
00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:31.640
The kernel is the layer that talks
to the actual machine hardware.

55
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.390
So the CPU,

56
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.460
the scheduling all these things threading,
that's what the kernel does.

57
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.150
And then utilities.

58
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.590
Today we're just using utilities.

59
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.090
What I really like about Linux and
the idea behind it is instead

60
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.220
of baking everything into the operating
system, baking everything into the kernel.

61
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.200
You're baking the utilities.

62
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.470
Utilities are just the tiny little
applications that do one thing,

63
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.160
generally one thing.

64
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.770
But they're, because they're tiny little
applications, they can be updated and

65
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.160
not break the kernel.

66
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.760
And all they are is just ways
of interacting with the kernel

67
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.250
interacting with other other
applications on the system.

68
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.170
And so everything we're doing today
is just gonna be these utilities and

69
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.820
it's, really is a brilliant
model that they invented.

70
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.926
That makes it much simpler versus windows
where everything's baked into Windows.

71
00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:16.710
So you wanna do an update,
if to update all of windows, generally.

72
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.440
So we choose Ubuntu.

73
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.770
Switch back over, and

74
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.430
we're gonna choose the lowest,
slowest, cheapest server there is.

75
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.660
You won't need anything more
advanced than that today.

76
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.060
You might in the future, but

77
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.480
generally, it's better to choose kind
of the medium tier that you need.

78
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.960
And then you can always scale up or
scale down as you need.

79
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.700
But for
this I wanna go as cheap as possible.

80
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.990
So at 7 cent, no was that a fraction of?

81
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.210
It's of a fraction of a fraction
of a cents an hour and

82
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.600
that's generally what compute charge
is charging in terms of hours.

83
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.330
So it's gonna run about $5 a month,
so it's not too bad.

84
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.040
And with the credits,
you should get 10 months free.

85
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.040
If you want, you can switch to AWS or
something like that.

86
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.340
But for learning purposes,
let's choose the standard.

87
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.980
And how big is ago?

88
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.260
Wow.
Goes 32 that's pretty impressive.

89
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.650
And all of these are, they're going to
have solid state drive so that means

90
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.460
the data read is gonna be a little bit
faster than standard centre computers.

91
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.490
We could also choose something,
if we're doing a lot of things in memory.

92
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.110
So if we wanna do, say, video editing
in memory or something like that,

93
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.330
a lot of compute, we can choose
something with a lot more memory.

94
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.140
But again, choose standard, and

95
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.410
choose the data center region
that's gonna be closest to you.

96
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.300
It won't matter too much generally,
unless you choose Bangalore in India.

97
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.620
Which is gonna a little bit slower github.

98
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.420
But I'm gonna go to San Francisco
because if I'm working in that,

99
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.150
that's where I'm gonna be.

100
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.170
But depending where you are in
the world to choose datacenter,

101
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.970
that's a little bit closer.

102
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.090
And we choose the version we
chose was the LTS version.

103
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.880
That's the long term support.

104
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.280
If you're building things for
production and

105
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.430
not just developments,
something that's gonna live a long time.

106
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.520
You always want to choose the LTS version.

107
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.392
It's tempting to say Ubuntu 19 is out,
let's use that instead but

108
00:05:11.392 --> 00:05:15.710
that's gonna change over time,
there's gonna be version 20, version 21.

109
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.860
And that the commands
might change a little bit,

110
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.770
the way things are installed
might be a little bit different.

111
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.940
But I chose the LTS version because
that's gonna be around for many years.

112
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.030
At Netflix,
we use the LTS version of node as well.

113
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.060
Which it kind of sucks because we're
not if node says, Hey, we now support

114
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.880
top level a sink await I can't use that
until that moves to the LTS version.

115
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.800
But because we're real application
that needs a live a long time,

116
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.230
we don't stay on the bleeding edge.

117
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.660
That's the downsides of being at scale.

118
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.490
But for this class,

119
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.510
we chose ubuntu LTS version because
it'll work even two years from now.
