00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.890
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
let's try another exercise.

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.480
Let's try trace routes.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.630
I love trace routes.

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.560
So whenever I put man something,
that's just for your own information.

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.263
Just so you know that I'm not
just giving you random commands,

6
00:00:14.263 --> 00:00:15.999
cuz that's what this day's all about.

7
00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.360
I want you to have context
on what we're doing.

8
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.630
A lot of what we learn today,
you can learn from a tutorial or

9
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.060
you can look it up on Google or
something like that.

10
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.770
But I wanna give you all the context and
allow you to ask questions and

11
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.100
not just type in arbitrary commands.

12
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.450
So if you wanna run traceroute,
just run traceroute google.com.

13
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.480
And I'll go ahead and do that here.

14
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.903
Clear, google.com.

15
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.266
And of course, the side benefits classes,
I wanna make you look cool.

16
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.943
So if you're just at a computer and
trying to impress someone,

17
00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:50.365
just run traceroute something.

18
00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:53.230
And it makes it look like you're
doing all this really cool stuff.

19
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.455
But all we're really doing is instead
of ping, which goes directly to this,

20
00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:00.775
it hits a server that comes back and
says, hey, I'm alive.

21
00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:04.936
Traceroute gives you a map of
every single hop along that point.

22
00:01:04.936 --> 00:01:08.370
Remember, how I said the Internet's
built on trust in servers, and nodes,

23
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.020
and switches?

24
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.817
That's what we're doing.

25
00:01:11.817 --> 00:01:17.150
It's mapping the path of every single
server that we hit along the way.

26
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.094
So every time you see another hop, and a
hop is just from one to two, two to three,

27
00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:22.603
three to four stuff like that.

28
00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:29.580
It just says, hey, I'm at 192.168.3.1.

29
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.568
I'm trying to get to 172.217.8.174.

30
00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:35.591
How do I get there?

31
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:38.782
So every single hop the server's like,
I don't know, but this person knows.

32
00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:39.918
I don't know, but this person knows.

33
00:01:39.918 --> 00:01:43.527
And eventually it just gets passed along,
passed along,

34
00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:47.664
passed until we end up on the actual
Google server, which is here.

35
00:01:47.664 --> 00:01:51.125
I love traceroute cuz, one,
it makes me look cool.

36
00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:54.460
Two, it helps diagnose network problems.

37
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.360
So again, if you have a website and
your client says, hey,

38
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.034
I can't reach your website,
you can run traceroute.

39
00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:04.521
And traceroute will tell you exactly where
the hops break down if you can't connect

40
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.070
to the site either.

41
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.199
So it could be a hit here which
will be 192, it's generally,

42
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.267
.168 is your local network almost always.

43
00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:20.580
And it hits here,
cogento cogento said that, is that an ISP?

44
00:02:22.712 --> 00:02:25.391
Didn't know, different part of the
country, but that's hitting the ISP and

45
00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:27.953
that's trying to resolve-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cogent is our ISP.

46
00:02:27.953 --> 00:02:33.759
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Cogentco,
[SOUND] cogentco, that's a good name.

47
00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:38.730
All right, but essentially, let's say
the hops died here at number two.

48
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.601
That means the ISP is not resolving, and
you know something's just out in general.

49
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:46.174
Versus if we get further down,
we get closer to the Google resolver,

50
00:02:46.174 --> 00:02:49.570
as we get closer and closer to
the actual server, and it dies out.

51
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.960
We know that it could be a load balancer
that's out, it's probably Google itself.

52
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.480
Trace route is very useful for

53
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.590
that if you're trying to determine
what's wrong with your site.

54
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.695
Again, it's just this thing
to have in your back pocket.

55
00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:06.892
And an example of, when I did it at home,
it was much faster hops.

56
00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:09.570
There's actually 16 hops to get to Google,
which is actually quite a bit.

57
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.586
They're usually really, really fast.

58
00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:15.607
So try traceroute on frontendmasters.com.

59
00:03:21.217 --> 00:03:23.202
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: traceroute.

60
00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:37.820
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Maybe,
maybe it will resolve.

61
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.830
When I tried this last time,
it didn't resolve.

62
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.670
It may resolve now.

63
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.552
But what's happening,
I'll just leave it running, switch over.

64
00:03:46.552 --> 00:03:49.595
What's happening is traceroute and

65
00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:53.920
ping are both running
a thing called ICMP requests.

66
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.310
So ICMP is Internet Control
Message Protocol, instead of TCP,

67
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.228
which is Transmission Control Protocol.

68
00:03:59.228 --> 00:04:03.350
This is saying, hey,
these are health checks of sort.

69
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.745
So ping is a sort of health check saying,
are you alive?

70
00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:10.603
Traceroute is, how many hops does it take
to get to the server, are you alive?

71
00:04:10.603 --> 00:04:11.973
And looks like it,

72
00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:17.370
you can configure your server to not
respond to ICMP requests at all.

73
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.220
So the same thing happens if you
try to ping frontendmasters.com,

74
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.570
it won't respond.

75
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.590
And this is what is we call black holing.

76
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.346
Where, if you wanna explicitly deny
requests, you can say, not allowed,

77
00:04:29.346 --> 00:04:30.930
hey, don't do that.

78
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.300
We're not gonna accept that.

79
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.333
Black holing is just saying, we're not
even gonna respond to your requests.

80
00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:37.924
If you had a party and
you see a cool person and

81
00:04:37.924 --> 00:04:39.440
they just ignore you completely.

82
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.980
That's kinda black holing.

83
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.990
That never happens to me, ever.

84
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.345
I was the cool person at the party.

85
00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:48.006
We're sharing a lot of information today,
[LAUGH] we got a long way.

86
00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:50.496
We're gonna get to know
each other by the end.

87
00:04:50.496 --> 00:04:55.225
So frontendmasters.com, the way it's
configured is they just set their

88
00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:59.215
ICMP requests to one,
they're just gonna ignore all of them.

89
00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.412
And that's why ping and
traceroute don't work.

90
00:05:01.412 --> 00:05:03.650
You can configure your website to do that.

91
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.734
Maybe you don't wanna get pinged to death,
which usually doesn't happen anymore.

92
00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:10.550
But in the old days of the Internet, you
could take down a site by pinging them.

93
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.554
I can set up five or six servers and
just keep pinging, pinging, pinging, and

94
00:05:14.554 --> 00:05:17.972
because every ping, the computer
is obligated to respond to you.

95
00:05:17.972 --> 00:05:19.532
You can take down a website before,

96
00:05:19.532 --> 00:05:21.720
this is the old days,
now it won't work anymore.

97
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.220
But it would just overload
the server with requests.

98
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.580
And you may wanna disable that for
your server, you might not want to.

99
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.170
I usually keep it alive.

100
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.737
It's good for debugging, so
I can ping my own website.

101
00:05:33.737 --> 00:05:36.127
I can run traceroute on it, but
sometimes you don't want that.

102
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.751
And that's totally up to you, that's the
great thing about running your own server,

103
00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:41.050
is you have complete control.
