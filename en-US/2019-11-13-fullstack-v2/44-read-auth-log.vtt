00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:02.229
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And if you wanna see who,

2
00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:07.235
what type of,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Who allows hackers to exist,

3
00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:07.813
right?

4
00:00:07.813 --> 00:00:11.510
It's the internet,
there are certain rules we follow.

5
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.730
If I type in all caps, that means I'm
yelling, if I do a /s, that means sarcasm.

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.610
We all know these rules.

7
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.456
So why are people always trying
to break into my server?

8
00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:21.169
Or, where are they coming from?

9
00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.025
And attackers predominantly come
from a few places in the world,

10
00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:30.980
where just these things are looks
as it's okay if you do this.

11
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.140
If you wanna see that, we can check
our auth.log like we usually do.

12
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.304
I pulled mine, and I just pulled
a random IP address from there.

13
00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:42.670
And I'm gonna use
the MaxMind GeoIP database.

14
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.530
And it tells me that the attackers
came from Singapore in China.

15
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.250
And predominantly, this has nothing to
do with the culture of the countries or

16
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.310
anything like that.

17
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.028
But a lot of attacks tend to come from
Russia and Asia and the United States.

18
00:00:57.735 --> 00:00:59.584
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I just find it's
interesting sometimes, where like,

19
00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:01.060
how do they even find me?

20
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.175
Sometimes I'll see some from North Korea,
which is like, what?

21
00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:07.802
[LAUGH] Okay, what do they care about me?

22
00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:12.402
But if you're curious, you can go
to maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo, and

23
00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:16.460
then pull just a random IP
from your from your auth.log.

24
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.405
And just see where these attacks
are coming from in the world.

25
00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:24.079
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Honestly, I think it's
pretty brazen that they're not even gonna

26
00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.570
hide their IP address because they know
nothing's going to be done about it.

27
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.884
I can report them to the Singapore
government, and they'll be like, yeah,

28
00:01:29.884 --> 00:01:30.880
we'll look into that.

29
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.796
No, they won't.

30
00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:39.060
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But
seems like an interesting country.

31
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.190
Just let me know,
like Tanzania, or something.

32
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.540
Cuz that would be a new one,
that would be cool.
