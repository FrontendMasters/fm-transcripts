00:00:00.417 --> 00:00:02.368
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So
we gotta start with a correction.

2
00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:05.957
I typically write for my XHR.

3
00:00:05.957 --> 00:00:06.830
I write XHR.

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.233
Actually, the request,

5
00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:19.440
the feature is XMLHTTPRequest, not XHR.

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.835
HTTP request.

7
00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:22.414
Hopefully you will have spotted that.

8
00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:27.815
It's XMLHTTPRequest and
I often just conflate

9
00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:32.950
it to XHR to save writing
out the whole thing.

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.338
But of course,
that means I wrote XHR here.

11
00:00:37.338 --> 00:00:41.196
It is in fact correctly XMLHTTPRrequest.

12
00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:45.794
If you don't wanna write the whole thing
out, you can just refer to it as XHR.

13
00:00:45.794 --> 00:00:48.093
That's the feature
the browser that we're using.

14
00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:51.286
So
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: If any of you were

15
00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:55.105
thinking, where is this
mysterious XHR with HTTPRequest.

16
00:00:55.105 --> 00:01:01.103
It's a conflation in my mind of
XMLHTTPRequest, and XHR, okay.
