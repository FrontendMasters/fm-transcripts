00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.031
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: All right folks,
here we go.

2
00:00:02.031 --> 00:00:07.314
You have your partners,
you are gonna go to csbin.io/callbacks.

3
00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:08.916
And you need one machine
between two of you.

4
00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:10.785
One machine between two
cuz you are pairing.

5
00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:13.177
If you wanna use one of the research
machine you can I guess, but-

6
00:00:13.177 --> 00:00:13.766
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.321
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Exactly,

8
00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:17.037
put it in the middle,
put the machine in the middle.

9
00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:20.404
And if you hit block raise your hand and
I will come round and

10
00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:22.070
help navigate you through.

11
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.540
But folks,
get to your pair programming challenges.

12
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.783
csbin.io for our online audience as well.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What did you say?

13
00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:31.470
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: csbin.io/callbacks.

14
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.420
There it is.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, yeah.

15
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.040
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: There it is.

16
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.130
And folks, this material is gonna
push you beyond what we've just seen.

17
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.250
And then we're gonna start to
see approaches to this stuff

18
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.830
after the pairing in about 10, 15 minutes.

19
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.390
But folks, get to your pairing.

20
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.190
I wanna hear the warm,
energetic mumbling of pair programming.

21
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.950
Get to it, people.
