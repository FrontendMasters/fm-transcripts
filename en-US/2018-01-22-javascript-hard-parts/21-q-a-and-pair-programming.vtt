00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.980
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Thumbs on this.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.900
I do not know what happened.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.810
I have clarifications.

4
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.720
It's okay.

5
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.980
This is the foundation.

6
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.520
We get this down, closure follows very
naturally, very naturally from this.

7
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.640
No idea what happened, clarification,
it's good to have clarifications,

8
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.480
unclear on this notion besides maybe,

9
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.450
why are we building this function
inside of another function?

10
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.460
Okay besides that, everyone's thumbs out.

11
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.748
Put that bit on hold, or
maybe not, I don't know.

12
00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:26.522
Everyone saw that.

13
00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:28.364
No idea what happened,
clarification, clear.

14
00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:31.371
I love building functions inside of
other functions for no apparent reason.

15
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:32.702
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Everyone's thumbs out.

16
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.698
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Dave
you've got a clarification.

17
00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:36.560
I'd love to hear it.

18
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.040
Clarifications are really helpful people,
Dave?

19
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.190
&gt;&gt; Dave: I don't think
I have a clarification.

20
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.304
I just think it was a lot to digest.

21
00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:42.089
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: It is.

22
00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:42.770
I appreciate that, man.

23
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.546
Why are we possibly creating a multiply
by two function inside another function?

24
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:53.240
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: It's disheartening,
isn't it?

25
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.030
No, [INAUDIBLE], it's good.

26
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.438
It's because it turns out,

27
00:00:57.438 --> 00:01:02.175
I'm trying not to be too intimidating,
don't worry, everybody.

28
00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:06.120
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Better?

29
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.260
All right,
it's because we get something bonus.

30
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.120
We get a huge bonus.

31
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.060
When we return out a function that was
defined inside another function, man,

32
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.920
we ain't just getting a function,
we're gonna get a big bonus.

33
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.380
And we're gonna see that
all play out very soon.

34
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.410
All right, go ahead, dude?

35
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.822
&gt;&gt; Dave: Do you do that, the instruction
generator as a higher order function?

36
00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:32.290
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: You mean
taking a function to it as well?

37
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.320
&gt;&gt; Dave: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: By definition is

38
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.570
a higher order function because
it returned out a function.

39
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.083
But it could also take in a function for
sure.

40
00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:40.310
Hold that thought, that's gonna be
very interesting in the challenges.

41
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.820
All right, and at that point,
I believe it is challenges.

42
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.710
So I think it will be fun
to- these are the same ones.

43
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.050
You haven't been pairing for that long so

44
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.670
I would say stick with your pair for
now, actually.

45
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.560
And you know how to pair.

46
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.250
Such a relief for
me to not to have to explain pairing.

47
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.672
Again, go straight here,
csbin.io/closures, and

48
00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:06.962
start working through
the closure challenges folk.

49
00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:12.420
And we're gonna come back together and see
how closure works based on this material.

50
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.850
So you're gonna be attacking problems
with stuff you ain't seen yet.

51
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.690
We're gonna see how to do it afterwards,
but tackle them for now.
