1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.570
&gt;&gt; Will: So here we go.

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.890
There's me.
There's me, I did my studies there.

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.690
Currently on Codesmith.

4
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.230
Previously create Icecomm.

5
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.846
This is a thing I built
with my friend Alex,

6
00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:15.480
which became the most popular WebRTC,
has anybody used a WebRTC?

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.724
Web Real-Time Communication, a tool for

8
00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:23.690
letting you build in the browser
peer-to-peer connectivity.

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.500
For video, for data, this is a library
which we built a couple of years ago.

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.150
Before that, I go to Jim.

11
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.100
There are my wonderful talented sisters,
I was just on the phone with one of them

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.520
because she's being press-ganged
into working for Codesmith briefly.

13
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.610
I've told her she'll get below
minimum wage, above minimum wage.

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
But she's working not from this country,
so I can do whatever I want.

15
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.640
Okay, good, and
there's the wonderful Codesmith team.

16
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.820
There we go, excellent.

17
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.630
So I teach software
engineering at Codesmith.

18
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.580
What is Codesmith?

19
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.450
A center of software
engineering excellence.

20
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.940
So people who come to Codesmith,

21
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.600
they come to build these
powerful open source projects.

22
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.684
A recent one, if any of you have built
react projects, one is called Reactide.

23
00:01:13.684 --> 00:01:17.090
It's an IDE for
building React applications.

24
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.879
I think it has 7,500 GitHub stars.

25
00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:25.060
That was built by Peter, Mark,
and Jenn, and that's an app for

26
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.560
building React applications.

27
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.860
So these are all open source,
just like Mark in Frontend Masters,

28
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.750
gives to the developer
community through instruction,

29
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.620
Codesmith aspires to do so through
some of the projects that get built.

30
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.690
WebDSP, a tool that let's you
do sophisticated edge detection

31
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.790
in live-stream video in the browser,
was featured at Google I/O.

32
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.690
All of these things are the sort
of projects that I hope all of you

33
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.290
are aspiring to build, and for
those folk who went to Prime Digital,

34
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.950
I hope that you all built there and
also aspire to build now.

35
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.241
These sort of ground-breaking developer,
focused developer,

36
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:17.850
giving technologies that let developers
grow through your contributions.

37
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.280
So it's based in LA, New York,
and Oxford University.

38
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.340
We select a group of people who
have all these five capacities,

39
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.160
and we'll talk about in a second.

40
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.280
Graduates typically go on to
mid-level engineer roles.

41
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.830
So people come in, typically,
at junior or above, and

42
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.920
then get mid level or
senior or even above senior.

43
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.781
Then after graduating, they often
get involved in machine learning,

44
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.555
which is a huge part of
the Codesmith curriculum.

45
00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:52.305
All right, the team that makes
it all happen, there's Weylin,

46
00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:56.580
who runs the machine learning program,
Brandon, head of engineering, there we go.

47
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.690
Good, the things we look for
in candidates for Codesmith.

48
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.100
I tell you this, not about Codesmith.

49
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.660
I tell you this because these are the five
things that many of you here are on

50
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.750
the job search, or
going to be so at some point.

51
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.810
These are the five things that
make a world class engineer.

52
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.830
No question.

53
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:21.170
The top two are the most important.
&gt;&gt; Will: Not the bottom one.

54
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.630
The bottom one says language and

55
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.350
computer science experience,
JavaScript experience, Python experience.

56
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.150
Those of course matter.

57
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.290
The thing that really matters is
your problem solving with code and

58
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.840
your technical communication.

59
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.887
We are gonna spend the next two days,

60
00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:43.997
we are gonna spend the next two days,
the next two, two days,

61
00:03:43.997 --> 00:03:50.080
working through developing all
five of these capacities together.

62
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.620
That's what the next two
days are gonna look like.

63
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.340
Even here, these are our expectations for
Codesmith but even here,

64
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.680
the app Frontend Masters,
above all else, support each other.

65
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.100
That means, the person who's still here
after hours working through lunch,

66
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.980
helping somebody else, the person
the pairing who rather than saying,

67
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.360
how fast can I figure this out for myself.

68
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.400
When I come over, I see is instead,
mentoring the person next to them,

69
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.230
is navigating through the bug
with the person next to them.

70
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.110
That is the person who is
following the core Codesmith, and

71
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.370
I believe as well,
core Frontend Masters values.

72
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.510
All right, excellent.

73
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.630
Here we go.

74
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.759
Frontend Masters- JavaScript
the Hard Parts- Day 1.

75
00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.142
We're gonna start off with
Principles of JavaScript- Thread,

76
00:04:40.142 --> 00:04:41.970
Execution Context, Call Stack.

77
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.130
Then Callbacks and Higher order functions,
then Closure, all in one day.

78
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.750
Our part is Part 1 and 2 in one day.

79
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.810
Then Day 2, Asynchronous JavaScript,
OOP in JavaScript.

80
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.390
Part 4 and 5, or Part 3 and
4 of Hard Parts, all in two days.

81
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.810
In JavaScript for the Hard Parts, we start
with a set of fundamental principles.

82
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.440
We item them three times, always.

83
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.430
That's how you really cement them.

84
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.370
These will let us problem solve
through the hard parts to come.

85
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.460
Let me be really clear with you.

86
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.370
A lot of the focus of the next two days,
for real, is technical communication.

87
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.470
We've said this already, but
the goal of hard parts is

88
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.480
to work on almost a full body
workout of these five things.

89
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.000
The missing piece,
there are a couple of programs out there,

90
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.110
coding immersive type programs that
get problem solving down really well.

91
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.669
They make you struggle and
I always shut those out.

92
00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.570
If you wanna know who they are,
I'll tell you them, they're very good.

93
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.786
What none of them take to the next level
that gets the consistent mid-senior

94
00:05:49.786 --> 00:05:54.120
offers for Codesmith grads
is technical communication.

95
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.420
The ability to explain my code to you,

96
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.040
my approach to you, so
that you can even implement it yourself,

97
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.480
without me ever actually seeing
the code that you've written.

98
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.000
But you can explain it
with such precision.

99
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.904
That turns out to be such an amazing
predictor of how you work

100
00:06:14.904 --> 00:06:17.073
as a seasoned developer.

101
00:06:17.073 --> 00:06:19.842
It is such an amazing predictor of that,
and so

102
00:06:19.842 --> 00:06:22.700
that's what we will really focus on today.

103
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.690
That's what all this diagramming is about.

104
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.810
That's what me calling on all of you for
every single line.

105
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.910
That is the hard part approach.

106
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.910
That's how we'll be approaching
it throughout, so be ready.
