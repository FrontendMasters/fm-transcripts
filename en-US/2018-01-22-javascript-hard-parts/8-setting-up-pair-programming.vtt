00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:05.174
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: We're gonna move into
the wonderful world of pair programming.

2
00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:09.300
We're gonna look through this list
of things that you might have done,

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.750
evaluate yourself,
give yourself a score, a tally, a total.

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.400
A total, that's the word I should use.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.698
People often think it's like levels,
no, give yourselves a total.

6
00:00:20.698 --> 00:00:25.265
Out of nine, looks like nine to me,
so a total of nine.

7
00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:31.402
Give ourselves a total of nine, we're then
going to line up ourselves along here,

8
00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:36.158
and looking coyly,
this is an acceptable thing, whatever.

9
00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:41.590
We are gonna have ones, twos, and threes,
fours, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

10
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.612
Line ourselves up.

11
00:00:42.612 --> 00:00:47.129
We're gonna pair off by
relative experience level.

12
00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.868
And we are going to start working
through the challenges in pairs.

13
00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:54.653
We're gonna talk about how pair
programming works, how to make it

14
00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:58.995
effective, why it is the secret hidden
hack to growing fast as a developer.

15
00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:03.430
But first we're gonna pair
off by relative experience.
