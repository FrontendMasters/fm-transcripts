00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.280
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Okay,
let's have thumbs on this function.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.341
Everyone's thumbs out?

3
00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:06.770
You're gonna be very disappointed in
a moment by the next function we see.

4
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.462
Dave, do you wanna clarify?

5
00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:14.433
&gt;&gt; Dave: There has been far and let.

6
00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:19.108
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: It's essentially,
ES 2015 introduced us these two new

7
00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:22.324
ways to clear our labels, const and let.

8
00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:27.079
The reason in hard parts I just use var
is because, for our purposes in our path,

9
00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.441
we're not too worried.

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.241
But just know here's our fundamental rule.

11
00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.836
And it's not followed here, but we should.

12
00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:34.221
Here's our fundamental rule.

13
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:38.639
We should use const for
everything, objects,

14
00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:42.292
arrays, numbers, strings, const.

15
00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:46.054
Unless we know we are specifically gonna
take what data's in there right now,

16
00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:49.820
the whole object, or the whole array,
or the whole number, and throw it out.

17
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.534
Replace it with a new object,
array, or value.

18
00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:55.053
In which case we will use let.

19
00:00:55.053 --> 00:00:58.932
So that's the only rule,
const all the time unless we know we

20
00:00:58.932 --> 00:01:03.895
are absolutely gonna fully reassign
this data, in which case we can use let.

21
00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:05.941
So we should probably for output.

22
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:06.772
There's a debate.

23
00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:10.153
We should probably for
output there, use const.

24
00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.669
There's a debate about it,
we should use const.

25
00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:15.134
I just use var and hot pots because
it doesn't give us anything for

26
00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:18.040
what we're doing in our
particular areas of hot pots.

27
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.565
So for now just know when you
see that let, const or var,

28
00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:24.530
the next word is gonna be a label.

29
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.188
And then the thing on

30
00:01:25.188 --> 00:01:27.600
the other side of the equals sign is
gonna be the data stored in that label.

31
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.297
Make sense, Dave?

32
00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:28.797
All right,
