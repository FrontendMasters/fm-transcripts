00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.180
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: This solution for
class keyword,

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.780
has emerged as a new standard in
JavaScript professional engineering.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.200
Feels more like the sound
of other languages, but

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.110
99% of developers do
not know how it works.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.780
And therefore fail their interviews.

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.800
You will not be one of those people,

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.200
because you now the hard
parts of JavaScript.

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.700
Very well done.

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.250
And to my online audience,
enormously well done.

10
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.580
We are at 4:30,
I wanna add one final thing.

11
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.404
Hard Parts Challenge Code.

12
00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:38.140
This is because this is

13
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.820
a tough set of two days of learning,
of building, of experimenting.

14
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.550
The Codesmith residency based in New York,
and

15
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.850
in Los Angeles and in Oxford in the UK,

16
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.560
has two predominant locations,
New York and LA.

17
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.090
In New York,
the first cohort happens September 25th.

18
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.400
We're selecting 12 people.

19
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.660
We had 165 applications
in the first four weeks

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.680
after we opened, the applications for

21
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.980
it were set in 12 very, very challenged
people for September 25th cohort.

22
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.010
In LA,
we select a larger group closer to 20, 25.

23
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.580
And from those, hundreds of people
apply to get into those cohorts.

24
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.050
We take in people who are already
at least junior, developer level.

25
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.190
Some come in at CTO level.

26
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
This is really my thing going right now.

27
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.366
Some come in at at least CTO level,
very rarely, one or two.

28
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:49.120
Some come in at senior dev level, all of
them coming because they want a level up,

29
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.230
in their under the hood
understanding of JavaScript.

30
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.180
They want to become
excellent telecommunicators.

31
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.130
I was talking over here a second ago.

32
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.790
I understand why, we try to give you
hypothesize why grads do so well.

33
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.890
And one theory goes,
the technical communication piece.

34
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.034
Lectures aren't really about conceptual
understanding as much as they're about

35
00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:16.598
a chance for you to polish and refine
how you communicate with each other.

36
00:02:16.598 --> 00:02:21.350
But also with the whole room, exactly
what your code is doing, that's one.

37
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.880
Two, the projects.

38
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.607
We hinted at this the very start, and

39
00:02:24.607 --> 00:02:27.020
I tell you all as I tell our
online audience as well.

40
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.950
If you are aspiring to mid-senior roles,
and for the audience here as well,

41
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.210
do not build generic full-stack
applications with no users.

42
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.570
Build developer-empowering tools and
libraries.

43
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.220
It pitches you at a whole another level.

44
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.723
When Codesmith projects are Reactide,
7,000 GitHub stars,

45
00:02:49.723 --> 00:02:54.147
WebDSP hundreds of GitHub stars and
featured on the headline stage

46
00:02:54.147 --> 00:02:58.495
of Google I/O, it's developer conference,
a few months ago.

47
00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:02.473
Or overview,
alive with thousands of GitHub stars for

48
00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:06.980
viewing state in the view library,
all of these, you can do.

49
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.230
All this under the hood understanding
allows you to actually build libraries and

50
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.590
tools that empower other developers,
not just make it work.

51
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.880
You can do that.

52
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.310
That's also a core part
of the Codesmith program,

53
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.650
is building those sort of projects.

54
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.910
But you can do them regardless.

55
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.321
I just say,
set your aspirations high, all right.

56
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:32.720
So, how do you apply?

57
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.780
Well, the online application for
Codesmith,

58
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.180
we take about a quarter of those people
to interview based on what they say.

59
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.090
They have to write a few little essays
about why they're inspired about coding,

60
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.400
what they've built,
the things they've done.

61
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.150
We also have
the Hard Parts Challenge Code.

62
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.467
This guarantees you an interview for

63
00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:53.990
the residency,
the 12 week residency at Codesmith.

64
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.148
90% of people who end up getting
accepted have attended Hard Parts.

65
00:03:58.148 --> 00:04:03.720
This is definitely really clear, not 90%
of the people are accepted, far from it.

66
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.740
But rather, people who get in,
most of them attempt the Hard Parts.

67
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.794
We created the Hard Parts Challenge Code
guarantee interview for

68
00:04:11.794 --> 00:04:13.690
the Hard Parts community members.

69
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.609
It started off like, people would
come to a session called hard parts,

70
00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.860
the first time I did this I
did like build a YouTube app.

71
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.789
And everyone walks up like I
can build the next YouTube,

72
00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.320
oka this is not necessarily quite.

73
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.900
People will come to me and

74
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.780
go Hard Parts, what a aspirational
driven group of people.

75
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.600
Every single person who gets into
Codesmith, I call them and I still make

76
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.760
decisions sometimes on how they grew
during their Hard Parts journey.

77
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.650
If you complete this Hard Parts Challenge
code, it lasts 24 hours,

78
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.450
only 24 hours then it's gone.

79
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.320
This isn't something that
the recorded will be of any use.

80
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.650
Only 24 hours for people watching online
live, and engaging, and for us here.

81
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.813
If you complete it within 24 hours,
you are guaranteed interview for

82
00:04:59.813 --> 00:05:02.833
the LA or New York location of Codesmith.

83
00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:05.260
The East Coast campus headquarters,
the West Coast headquarters.

84
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.260
It builds upon not the OOP content, we're
gonna have it built upon the callbacks and

85
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.980
higher functions content.

86
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.430
And it has a special code
that I wrote on my hand.

87
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.970
Very professional,
I know you can appreciate that.

88
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.650
It's a callbacks high order
function challenge and it's e q9k,

89
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.100
and to reach it go to the apply
page of Codesmith.io.

90
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.410
Or you can get to it and
you can type this in,

91
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.150
it takes you to a secret application,
not the regular one.

92
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.680
Or go to,

93
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.240
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance:
codesmith.io/hardparts/eq9k.

94
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.890
Complete this challenge if you
are aspiring to get in code.

95
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.771
If you are trying to get
in your regular apply page,

96
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:01.866
if you run a really great application
you'll get invited to interview.

97
00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:05.071
But three quarters of people don't get
invited to interview from the regular

98
00:06:05.071 --> 00:06:08.410
application page cuz it's not
a technically demanding coding challenge.

99
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.020
It's just where as this guarantees
you interview for Codesmith.

100
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.760
By the way, it's also not the most
technically demanding challenge.

101
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.740
The interview itself, for Codesmith is,

102
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.210
we will push you in the interview
until you cannot solve the program.

103
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.100
I don't care that it's
a dynamic programming problem.

104
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.370
The dynamic program problem
will push you to there, and

105
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.860
see how you navigate through that block.

106
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.140
People who get full marks
on JavaScript don't get

107
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.920
in because what we really look for,
if you haven't been able to tell yet,

108
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.780
is technical communication and
problem solving.

109
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.580
All right, folks, so
that's the last thing I was gonna say.

110
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.150
We have drinks here, I wanna give a huge
shout out to our online audience for

111
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.120
their engagement throughout.

112
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.040
They were asking phenomenal
questions which helped all of us in

113
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.790
the room as well.

114
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.680
They were supporting each
other with pointers and tips.

115
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.660
Thank you, online audience, we're very
grateful to you around the world.

116
00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.470
Let's give them a round of applause,
actually.

117
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.728
Thank you to all our online members.
&gt;&gt; Group: [APPLAUSE]

118
00:07:02.728 --> 00:07:04.694
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: And thank you,

119
00:07:04.694 --> 00:07:06.210
above all.

120
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.800
Above all, preemptively above all or
just one rung below above all

121
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.600
to Mark and John, and
to the whole front-end masters team.

122
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.790
The whole team who has made this possible.

123
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.130
I want to give a personal thank you.

124
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.940
I was giving this talk,
potentially, a year ago, and

125
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:33.560
a very tough thing happened, and
therefore it was delayed until now.

126
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.520
But, Mark has been enormously
supportive throughout, and

127
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.010
I am very grateful to him for that.

128
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.900
And, he is somebody who has empowered so
many developers to give back.

129
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.660
And I hope someone in this room, maybe
many of you in this room will one day be

130
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.620
your marks rosters of leaders,
because that's what it's really all about.

131
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.298
The one thing about software engineering,

132
00:07:54.298 --> 00:07:56.300
is you can never run
out of stuff to learn.

133
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.330
How many jobs have that opportunity?

134
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.350
It's inspiring.

135
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.690
It also means you can never
run out of stuff to teach.

136
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.510
And that's a great blessing as well.

137
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:11.280
And Mark is creating a platform here
that we can all benefit from and

138
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.380
thank you so much, Mark.

139
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.176
I wanna give a personal thank you to you,
thank you my friend.

140
00:08:16.176 --> 00:08:17.118
&gt;&gt; Group: [APPLAUSE]

141
00:08:17.118 --> 00:08:19.352
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: And as a final thanks to

142
00:08:19.352 --> 00:08:24.176
all of you for
pushing through at least 15 hours

143
00:08:24.176 --> 00:08:29.830
worth of content together
over the last two days.

144
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.210
This wasn't sit back and
you know, casually.

145
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.970
This was sit forward,
constantly at risk of being called upon.

146
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.170
Those first hours,
the trepidation in your eyes.

147
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:41.388
And now the warmth,

148
00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:46.190
embracing the learning that you've
shown throughout the past two days.

149
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.950
I'm really, really proud of all of you.

150
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.660
And I hope this is the beginning
of you guys having an ongoing

151
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.300
friendship and
mentorship in both directions with me.

152
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.530
You all have my contacts.

153
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.182
I'll write it up.

154
00:09:00.182 --> 00:09:06.309
I guess you can use
will.sentence@gmail.com,

155
00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:10.876
or you can use will@codesmith.io.

156
00:09:10.876 --> 00:09:16.620
I also be in the beginning of an ongoing

157
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:24.100
mentorship in both
directions with all of us.

158
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.070
And so, share details with your
friends you made over these two days.

159
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.040
This weekend take these challenges.

160
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.900
Take more challenges, code wars.

161
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.810
Take more front end mollusks courses and
challenges.

162
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.490
And get pair programming
through all of them.

163
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.005
So finally,
give yourselves a round of applause.

164
00:09:40.005 --> 00:09:44.089
Very well done.
