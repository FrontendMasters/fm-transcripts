00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.392
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Okay, we're gonna
have thumbs and we're gonna go and

2
00:00:02.392 --> 00:00:04.584
test this out in pairing
through the challenges.

3
00:00:04.584 --> 00:00:08.065
And then we're gonna talk about
why is this even possible in Java?

4
00:00:08.065 --> 00:00:11.594
For a language where you do
not pass functions around,

5
00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:14.676
this is gonna feel very,
very uncomfortable.

6
00:00:14.676 --> 00:00:20.489
If you want a language that the idea of
passing a function into another function,

7
00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.546
is gonna feel very uncomfortable in
JavaScript, a core part of Java.

8
00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.921
So we're gonna see why after the pairing,
but first,

9
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.528
do you wanna phrase it as a question?

10
00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:33.651
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't understand
why instructions becomes function

11
00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:35.148
multiplied by two.

12
00:00:35.148 --> 00:00:37.098
Is it just because it's the second
parameter that's passed?

13
00:00:37.098 --> 00:00:39.734
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: It's exactly that,
damn right.

14
00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:41.529
So why does array become 1, 2, 3?

15
00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:48.504
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So
when we define the function, so

16
00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:50.599
with functions, there's two stages, right?

17
00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:54.081
There's the,
this is what it will do if you use me.

18
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.580
This is a definition.

19
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.487
It's like the, if you ever use me,
this is what I will do.

20
00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:01.963
And there is the running it.

21
00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:06.848
Can you gesture which
bit's the definition?

22
00:01:06.848 --> 00:01:09.485
Which bit of the copy array manipulate?

23
00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:15.167
Which version is the manipulation?

24
00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:16.428
Lindsay, which one of
these is a definition?

25
00:01:16.428 --> 00:01:17.406
&gt;&gt; Lindsay: The top one.

26
00:01:17.406 --> 00:01:18.713
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: The top one, exactly.

27
00:01:18.713 --> 00:01:22.662
copyArrayAndManipulate, that's like,
this is what I'll do if you ever run me.

28
00:01:22.662 --> 00:01:26.369
This is my description,
this is what my functionality is.

29
00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.724
That's general, it's generic.

30
00:01:27.724 --> 00:01:32.177
It says ultimately, I'm going to run
this functionality on some data,

31
00:01:32.177 --> 00:01:36.054
some numbers, or some strings,
or some words, or whatever.

32
00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:37.720
I'm gonna run it on some data, but

33
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.371
I don't yet
know what that data is going to be, right?

34
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:43.615
Because that's the whole point of having a
function is I want to be able to use it on

35
00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:44.823
all different types of data.

36
00:01:44.823 --> 00:01:48.984
So leave instead some blanks,
some placeholders for that data.

37
00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:56.132
And then when you do run me, and where am
I running copyArrayAndManipulate, Lindsay?

38
00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:57.007
&gt;&gt; Lindsay: The bottom line.

39
00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:58.051
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: How do
I know I'm running it?

40
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.048
&gt;&gt; Lindsay: With the parentheses.

41
00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:02.102
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: With the parens,
that's where I fill in my placeholders.

42
00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:05.006
So my blanks, so array is a blank,
I fill it in with what?

43
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:06.083
&gt;&gt; Lindsay: 1, 2, 3.

44
00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:08.192
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: And the instructions
are blank, I fill it in with?

45
00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:11.385
And the reason is just the ordering,
you're spot on, it's just the ordering.

46
00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:13.693
Okay, does that answer the question?

47
00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:14.605
Excellent, good clarification.

48
00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:17.686
All right, folk, at this point we're
gonna get back to the pairing,

49
00:02:17.686 --> 00:02:19.055
work through the challenges.

50
00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:24.232
Map with, and for
each make sure you try and do them.

51
00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:26.861
I'm gonna have a look at how
you reach doing them, and

52
00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:29.326
then we will talk about
how is this even possible.
